Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 29 full service branches located in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $1.59 billion, total deposits of $1.22 billion, total loans held for investment of $954.8 million (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $167.2 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 million, or 14.6%.\nHistory and Background\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of nine acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe\nour targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri and Topeka, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Net income allocable to common stockholders of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2014, a 22.3% increase. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Earnings per diluted share of $1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.30 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an 18.5% increase. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total loans held for investment of $960.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $234.5 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 32.3% increase. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total deposits of $1.22 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $234.7 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 23.9% increase. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total assets of $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $411.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 35.0% increase. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Book value per common share of $18.37 and tangible book value per common share of $15.97 at December 31, 2015. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe completed the underwritten IPO of our common stock on November 16, 2015, where we sold an aggregate of 2,231,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $22.50 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on November 11, 2015 under the ticker symbol \u201cEQBK.\u201d\nWe also completed our acquisition of First Independence Corporation (\u201cFirst Independence\u201d), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, Kansas on October 9, 2015. First Independence had consolidated total assets of $135.0 million, net loans of $89.9 million (net of allowances), and total deposits of $87.1 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2015 notes to consolidated financial statements \u201cNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans: As a part of previous acquisitions, we acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at the amount paid, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased\ncredit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nNonaccrual Loans: Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCore deposit intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31, as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\nEmerging Growth Company: Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We have irrevocably elected to adopt new accounting standards within the public company adoption period.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nResults of Operations\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and\nstockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Kansas and Missouri, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\nNet Income\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for year ended December 31, 2014. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 22.3%. In July 2014, we redeemed $15.5 million of preferred stock which reduced dividends on preferred stock by $531 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014. This redemption replaced preferred stock that had a 9.0% dividend rate with a bank stock loan carrying a 4.0% interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, increases in net interest income of $4.9 million and non-interest income of $1.1 million were partially offset by $2.9 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $1.8 million in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nNet Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.0 million compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.1 million. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $8.3 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock were $270 thousand less for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year of 2013. The benefit to 2014 net income allocable to common stockholders of the July 2014 redemption of $15.5 million in preferred stock was partially offset by the May 2014 increase, from 5% to 9%, in the dividend rate on $14.8 million of preferred stock prior to its redemption. During 2014, increases in net interest income of $126 thousand and non-interest income of $782 thousand were offset by $1.2 million in higher non-interest expenses and the provision for income taxes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was, in the opinion of management, the result of improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a \u201cvolume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a \u201cyield/rate change.\u201d\nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest Analysis\nTable 172:

The increase in net interest income is primarily due the increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest-earning assets. The increase in average volume of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in loans, investment securities and Federal funds sold and other. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 24.5%, from the interest expense of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities incurred to fund the increased volume of interest-earning assets.\nInterest income was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 13.3%. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.0 million, or 12.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan interest income was driven by the increase in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio decreased 32 basis points from 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2015. One of the factors that lessened the decrease in loan yields was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans due to increased mortgage origination and agricultural loans which were primarily prepayment and covenant breakage fees associated with a single relationship. The primary driver of the decrease in loan yields is the origination or purchase of commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage loans in a continually low interest rate environment.\nInterest expense was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million from the $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $355 thousand from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Average certificates of deposit increased $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and the average rate increased from 0.79% to 0.90% for the same time period resulting in an increase in related interest expense of $487 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB increased by $134.5 million from an average balance of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to an average balance of $157.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $150 thousand. In February 2015, we prepaid older higher cost FHLB term advances and began using the FHLB line of credit or LOC advance option, which is pre-payable without a fee and resulted in a much lower funding cost. Interest expense on our bank stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $641 thousand compared to $295 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point to 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest margin, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.65%, a decrease of 27 basis points compared with 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decline in our net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to our purchase of additional investment securities, our utilization of an available \u201cspread opportunity\u201d and the increase in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, which contributed to a decline in yield on our loan portfolio. In anticipation of consummating the acquisition of First Independence, we purchased approximately $30.0 million in investment securities to replace First Independence's investment portfolio of similar size that did not meet our investment criteria. We have since liquidated First Independence's investment portfolio. The \u201cspread opportunity\u201d involves borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions, resulting in a positive spread of approximately 25 basis points. We utilized the spread opportunity to generate income to help offset the costs associated with the First Independence merger and our initial public offering. We can reduce or terminate the spread opportunity each business day and we do not presently anticipate that this opportunity would be part of our core earnings stream or strategy. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $4.9 million, an increase in average interest-earning assets of $213.7 million and a decrease in net interest margin of 27 basis points.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.4 million compared with $41.2 million for the prior year, an increase of $126 thousand, or 0.3%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to a $177 thousand decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest\nexpense is due to lower average balances and rates paid on certificates of deposit and lower average balances and rates paid on FHLB term and LOC advances, partially offset by interest expense incurred in the last six months of 2014 on the $15.5 million bank stock loan. The $51 thousand decrease in interest income is due to decreased average balances and yields on the loan portfolio, partially offset by increases in average balances and yield on the investment portfolio. The decrease in the average loan volume is associated with our efforts to improve the loan portfolio's credit quality following the merger with First Community.\nInterest income was $46.8 million in each of 2014 and 2013. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $38.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $990 thousand, or 2.5%, compared with 2013. The decrease in loan interest income was driven by the decrease in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio remained unchanged at 5.63%. One of the factors that caused the yield on loans to remain unchanged was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans and agricultural loans. Interest income on securities was $8.0 million during 2014, an increase of $921 thousand over 2013 due to an 18 basis point increase in the average yield on the total securities portfolio and an increase in the average total securities portfolio of $13.6 million. The increases in the average yield and average volume of investment securities were primarily due to additional average volume of mortgage-backed securities of $8.0 million with an average yield of 2.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the average yield of 2.00% for the year ended December 31, 2013. We purchased additional mortgage-backed securities because this investment option provided us with a competitive yield.\nInterest expense was $5.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $177 thousand from the $5.6 million expensed in 2013. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.2 million for both 2014 and 2013. Average certificates of deposit decreased $20.3 million for 2014 compared to 2013 and the average rate decreased from 0.82% to 0.79% for the same time period resulting in a decrease in related interest expense of $294 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB decreased by $6.4 million, or 21.5%, from an average balance of $29.7 million in 2013 to an average balance of $23.3 million in 2014, resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $149 thousand. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Interest expense on the bank stock loan for the year of 2014 was $295 thousand. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNet interest margin, for 2014 was 3.92%, an increase of five basis points compared with 3.87% for 2013. The increase in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As discussed in more detail above, net interest margin was positively impacted by the increase in loan fee income that is reflected in interest income, decreases in the rate paid on deposits and FHLB advances, and was negatively impacted by the decrease in the average loan volume for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $126 thousand, a decrease in average interest-earning assets of $11.7 million and an increase in net interest margin.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses for probable incurred credit losses. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, but is decreased by charge-offs when the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, discounted cash flows, economic conditions, and other factors including regulatory guidance. As these factors change, the amount of the loan loss provision changes.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.0 million compared with $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased provision of $1.8 million was primarily related to increased charge-offs on loans, which were partially offset by changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and the reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.5 million compared to net charge-offs of $851 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross charge-offs were $3.7 million offset by gross recoveries of $237 thousand. In comparison, gross charge-offs were $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 offset by gross recoveries of $483 thousand.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was due to management's assessment as to the improved credit quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $851 thousand and $1.4 million. The decrease of $589 thousand reflected decreases in both gross charge-offs and gross recoveries when comparing the years of 2014 and 2013. Loans charged-off in 2014 totaled $1.3 million offset by $483 thousand of recoveries, compared to $2.0 million of gross charge-offs and $545 thousand of recoveries in 2013.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe primary sources of non-interest income are service charges and fees, debit card income, mortgage banking income, increases in the value of bank owned life insurance, investment referral income, the recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, and net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions. Non-interest income does not include loan origination or other loan fees which are recognized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the

December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest income totaled $9.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 13.0%, from $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in debit card income, the net gain on acquisition and mortgage banking income, partially offset by decreases in net gains on securities' transactions, other non-interest income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans. In our experience, favorable customer economic conditions are inversely related to non-sufficient fund charges, the largest component of service charges and fees, and are directly associated with debit card income. As economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The recognized amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired, including deferred tax assets associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards, exceeded the cash consideration exchanged in the First Independence acquisition resulting in the net gain on acquisition. Included in 2015 net gains on sales of and settlement of securities is $386 thousand received in connection with the bankruptcy settlement related to a political subdivision security written off in 2011. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $370 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with acquisitions, we received the rights to certain loans that were previously charged off by the acquired bank. At acquisition, there was no expectation of future cash flows from these previously charged-off loans and thus they were assigned a zero basis. Subsequent to the acquisitions, we have received cash payments on several of these loans. No interest has been accrued as cash flow payments have not been expected prior to receipt. Cash receipts on these zero-basis loans totaled $393 thousand and $500 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest income totaled $8.7 million, an increase of $782 thousand, or 9.9%, from $7.9 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increases in net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, mortgage banking income, other non-interest income, debit card income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, partially offset by a decrease in service charges and fees. Service charges and fees are primarily impacted by non-sufficient fund charges, which are cyclical in nature, generally fluctuate with the change in volume of transactional deposit accounts and economic conditions impacting our customers and represent a significant portion of the decrease in our service charges and fees. Service charges and fees declined $326 thousand from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $2.7 million for the comparable period of 2014, and debit card income and mortgage banking increased $126 thousand and $193 thousand for the same period. In our experience, as economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan originations during 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash receipts on zero-basis acquired loans totaled $500 thousand and $382 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $500 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest

31, 2015, non-interest expense totaled $38.6 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 8.2%, compared to December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to merger expenses of $1.7 million, an increase of $975 thousand in other expense, an increase of $409 thousand in data processing and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $316 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of $419 thousand in salaries and employee benefits, a decrease of $381 thousand in net occupancy expense and a decrease of $193 thousand in professional fees. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $419 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $162 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.7 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the 2014 termination of the restricted stock unit plan, or RSUP. There was no expense associated with the RSUP for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $419 thousand decrease in total salaries and benefits expense when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects increases in salaries, commissions, incentives, bonuses and benefits totaling $1.3 million, offset by the $1.7 million reduction in stock based compensation and $55 thousand reduction in contract labor costs. The $753 thousand increase in salaries and the $239 thousand increase in commissions, incentives and bonuses reflect cost-of-living raises, increased loan production, the achievement of performance targets and an increase in the number of employees subsequent to the October 9, 2015 merger with First Independence.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The majority of the decrease is due to the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in April 2015 and the construction of a new branch building in Wichita, which replaced rented space and was completed in November 2014, resulting in decreases in building rent that were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other occupancy costs increased $66 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the acquisition of First Independence and the addition of four branches in Southeast Kansas.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $409 thousand, or 16.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was principally due to increased debit card processing costs as usage increased.\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments, were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $193 thousand, or 8.5%, principally is due to a decrease in legal fees of $505 thousand, offset by an increase in accounting fees of $92 thousand and an increase in other professional fees of $215 thousand. The decrease in legal fees was primarily due to the settlement of the lawsuit with U.S. Bank in June 2015, as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financials Statements, \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS.\u201d The offsetting increases in professional fees are principally attributable to preparing for SEC registration and the reporting requirements of a public company.\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in \u201cNOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $418 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $131 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $526 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $505 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nMerger expenses: Merger expenses include legal, advisory and accounting fees associated with services to facilitate the acquisition of other banks. Merger expenses also include data processing conversion costs and costs associated with the integration of personnel, processes and facilities. On October 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of First Independence Corporation and its subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, based in Independence, Kansas. Merger expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 are related to this merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: We chose to incur a $316 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in February 2015 due to the prepayment of all our FHLB term advances. The weighted average rate of the FHLB term advances was 3.82%. To the extent that additional funding is needed our FHLB line of credit has a lower cost of funds, 0.48% at December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest expense totaled $35.6 million, an increase of $508 thousand, or 1.4%, compared with 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in salaries\nand employee benefits, and an increase of $468 thousand in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in expenses and losses, net of gains, related to other real estate owned. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $1.8 million for 2014 and $401 thousand for 2013. The increase of $1.4 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the May 2014 termination of the RSUP. Upon termination of the RSUP the vesting of the RSU's outstanding was accelerated, the service period was shortened, and the remaining unrecognized compensation was expensed. The expense associated with the RSUP was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $303 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013. Incentives and bonuses of $1.1 million for 2014 were up $393 thousand over the $747 thousand in incentives and bonuses expense for 2013, accounting for the remaining increase in salaries and employee benefit expense.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $36 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.5 million for 2014. An increase of $93 thousand, or 3.8%, from 2013 was due to technology enhancements during 2014.\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments were $2.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $468 thousand, or 25.8%, is related to legal matters discussed in \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and additional accounting and other professional services related to SEC registration.\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED, other real estate owned expenses were $331 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $44 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses were $397 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $375 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2013 other real estate owned expenses were $641 thousand and gains on the sale of other real estate owned, offset by provision for unrealized losses were $484 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $2.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in the internal evaluation of our performance and is not defined under GAAP. Our efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on sales of and settlement of securities and gain on acquisition. Generally, an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources.\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 72.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in \u201cResults of Operations - Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations - Non-Interest Income.\u201d\nOur efficiency ratio was 72.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with 72.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to increased non-interest expenses, primarily stock-based compensation associated with the RSUP termination in 2014 as discussed in \u201cResults of Operation - Non-Interest Expense.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, the amount non-deductible expenses and available tax credits.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax expense was $4.1 million compared with $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 28.7% and 31.9%, as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. As detailed in \u201cNOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax expense was $4.2 million compared with $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 31.9% and 31.0%, as compared to U.S. statutory rates of 35.0% and 34.0%. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits. Beginning in 2014, our federal taxable income exceeded $10.0 million resulting in a higher U.S. statutory rate.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.\nUnlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview\nOur total assets increased $411.2 million, or 35.0%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2014, to $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily from increases in net loans of $234.9 million, $127.3 million in investment securities, $25.1 million in cash and equivalents and $6.7 million in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock. Included in the above changes are the assets of First Independence, which totaled $135 million at acquisition. Our total liabilities increased $361.7 million, or 34.2%, from $1.06 billion at December 31, 2014 to $1.42 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total liabilities was\nprimarily from increases in FHLB advances of $124.5 million, $234.7 million in total deposits, and a $3.5 million net increase in the bank stock loan; and were partially offset by decreases of $4.5 million in federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements. Our total stockholders' equity increased $49.5 million, or 42.0%, from $117.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in total stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds from the initial public offering of $38.9 million and retained earnings of $10.1 million.\nLoan Portfolio\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. At December 31, 2015, our gross loans held for investment portfolio totaled $960.4 million, an increase of $234.5 million, or 32.3%, compared with December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquisition of First Independence, gross loans held for investment increased by $144.6 million, or 19.9%, compared with December 31, 2014. Overall growth consisted of $115.8 million or 49.4% from residential real estate; $78.9 million or 33.7% from commercial and industrial; $19.4 million or 8.3% from commercial real estate; $13.5 million or 5.8% from real estate construction; $9.2 million or 3.9% from consumer, $1.1 million or 0.5% from agricultural real estate; but were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million or 1.5% from agricultural. We also had loans classified as held for sale totaling $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, most of which are made to borrowers located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as various community markets throughout Kansas and Missouri. Although the portfolio is diversified and generally secured by various types of collateral, the majority of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and a substantial portion of our borrowers' ability to honor their obligations is dependent on local economic conditions in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, there was no concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding 10% of total loans.\nAt December 31, 2014, our gross loan held for investment portfolio totaled $725.9 million, an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.9%, compared with $660.3 million at December 31, 2013. This overall growth consisted of $43.7 million, or 66.7% from commercial and industrial; $13.5 million or 20.6% from commercial real estate; $9.1 million or 13.8% from real estate construction; and $9.1 million or 13.8% from residential real estate. Growth in our gross loans held for investment portfolio was partially offset by decreases of $5.0 million or 7.6% from agricultural real estate; $4.7 million or 7.2% from agricultural; and $86 thousand or 0.1% from consumer. Other loans classified as held for sale totaled $897 thousand at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, gross total loans were 79.0% of deposits and 60.6% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, gross total loans were 74.0% of deposits and 61.8% of total assets.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Our lending staff has been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. Several new lenders have been hired in our markets, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our lenders, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as community markets in both Kansas and Missouri.\nWe provide commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, real estate construction loans, homebuilder loans, SBA loans, agricultural and agricultural real estate loans, letters of credit and other loan products to national and regional companies, real estate developers, mortgage lenders, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. The types of loans we make to consumers include residential real estate loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, overdraft protection and letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:\nComposition of Loan Portfolio\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>

loans used to purchase fixed assets, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business. Our commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $262.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $78.9 million, or 43.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. Of this growth, $31.4 million, or 39.8%, was a result of broadly syndicated shared national credit originations and $18.9 million, or 23.9%, was a result of mortgage finance loan participation. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets, principal repayment, changes in the balances of revolving lines of credit, and loans acquired through First Independence.\nCommercial real estate: Commercial real estate loans include all loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties and by multifamily residential properties, as well as 1-4 family investment-purpose real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans were $343.1 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $19.4 million, or 6.0%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $13.0 million in commercial real estate loans acquired through First Independence. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets and principal repayment.\nReal estate construction: Real estate construction loans include loans made for the purpose of acquisition, development, or construction of real property, both commercial and consumer. Our real estate construction portfolio totaled $53.9 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $13.5 million, or 33.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in real estate construction loans is primarily related to increased originations.\nResidential real estate: Residential real estate loans include loans secured by primary or secondary personal residences. Our residential real estate portfolio totaled $250.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $115.8 million, or 86.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. During 2015, we purchased three pools of mortgage loans that represent $60.6 million of the increase that was partially offset by net payment activity in the existing residential real estate loans. During 2014, we purchased one pool of residential real estate loans totaling $26.2 million. These pools of mortgages were purchased to expand our loan portfolio and provide additional loan income. Additionally, the acquisition of First Federal added $71.3 million in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2015.\nAgricultural real estate, Agricultural, Consumer and other: Agricultural real estate loans are loans related to farmland. Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. These three loan pools represent 5.3% of our overall loan portfolio.\nThe contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table:\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

status, accruing loans 90 or more days past due, restructured loans, and other real estate acquired through foreclosure. Impaired loans do not include purchased loans that were identified upon acquisition as having experienced credit deterioration since origination (\u201cpurchased credit impaired loans\u201d or \u201cPCI loans\u201d). See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for information regarding the review of loans for determining the allowance for loan loss and impairment.\nWe had $8.2 million in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015, compared with $10.8 million at December 31, 2014. The nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 consisted of 74 separate credits and 61 separate borrowers. We had two nonperforming loan relationships each with outstanding balances exceeding $1.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThere are several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by lenders, and also monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.\nPotential Problem Loans\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually and classified based on credit risk. Consumer loans are considered pass credits unless downgraded due to payment status or reviewed as part of a larger credit relationship. We use the following definitions for risk ratings:\nPass: Loans classified as pass do not have any noted weaknesses and repayment of the loan is expected.\nSpecial Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of our credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nPotential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has concerns about the borrower's ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower's potential financial difficulties. Potential problem loans are assigned a grade of special mention or substandard . At December 31, 2015, the Company had $7.1 million in potential problem loans which were not included in either non-accrual or 90 days past due categories, compared to $20.7 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows as of December 31, 2015:\nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

credits increased to 98.4% of total loans from 95.7% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Classified loans were $15.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 51.2%, from $31.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from our continued focus on resolving classified loans in a timely manner as well as economic improvement in our principal markets.\nGenerally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nIn accordance with applicable regulation, appraisals or evaluations are required to independently value real estate and, as an important element, to consider when underwriting loans secured in part or in whole by real estate. The value of real estate collateral provides additional support to the borrower's credit capacity.\nWith respect to potential problem loans, all monitored and under-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated to determine if they are impaired. If we determine that a loan is impaired, then we evaluate the borrower's overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses based on the unlikelihood of full repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms or the net realizable value of the pledged collateral.\nAllowance for loan losses\nPlease see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional discussion of our allowance policy.\nIn connection with our review of the loan portfolio, risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered when assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Commercial and industrial loans are dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are advanced for equipment purchases, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business.

Financial information is obtained from the borrower to evaluate the debt service coverage and ability to repay the loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Commercial real estate loans are dependent on the industries tied to these loans as well as the local commercial real estate market.

Residential real estate loans are affected by the local residential real estate market, the local economy, and movement in interest rates. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit reports and debt to income ratios. Appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Agricultural real estate loans are real estate loans related to farmland, and are affected by the value of farmland.

These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nThe table below shows the contractually required principal loan payments and the associated purchase discount on our purchased credit impaired portfolio.\nRecorded Investment in Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractually required payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,794 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,167 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,536 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Analysis of allowance for loan and lease losses: At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million, or 0.57% of total loans. At December 31, 2014 the allowance for loan losses aggregated $6.0 million, or 0.82% of total loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses on loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $5.2 million, or 0.55%, of the $948.9 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2015, compared to an allowance for loan losses of $4.3 million, or 0.60%, of the $711.0 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2014, and an allowance for loan losses of $4.5 million, or 0.69%, of the $647.7 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily related to a change in applied loss factors which are based in part on historical loss experience as well as changes in the composition and quality of our loan portfolio collectively evaluated for impairment. The changes in composition included purchases of broadly syndicated loans, mortgage finance loans, and residential real estate mortgage pools which have different characteristics than our originated loan portfolio at December 31, 2014.\nNet losses as a percentage of average loans increased to 0.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 0.13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, and 0.21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. While net charge-offs increased during 2015, $1.5 million of these gross charge-offs had been previously identified and specifically reserved for in the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014.\nThere have been no material changes to our accounting policies related to our allowance for loan loss methodology during 2015 and 2014.\nThe following table presents, as of and for the periods

December 31, 2015 was adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at December 31, 2015.\nSecurities\nWe use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $441.3 million, an increase of $127.3 million, or 40.6%, compared with December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, securities represented 27.8% of total assets compared with 26.7% at December 31, 2014.\nAt the date of purchase, debt and equity securities are classified into one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not purchase securities for trading purposes. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts, in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in total interest and dividend income. Also included in total interest and dividend income are dividends received on stock investments in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the FHLB of Topeka. These stock investments are stated at cost.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of available-for-sale securities as of the dates

U.S. government and its agencies or sponsored entities) for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated stockholders' equity at the reporting dates noted.\nThe following tables summarize the contractual maturity of debt securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately. Available-for-sale securities are shown at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are shown at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts.\nTable 198: <table>

basis. </td> </tr>\n</table> Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized and accreted over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally produce decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will reflect higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion.\nThe contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities cause the average lives of these securities to be much different than their stated lives. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 95.8% and 87.5% of the mortgage-backed securities held by us had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 5.2 years and 4.6 years and a modified duration of 4.6 years and 4.2 years.\nDeposits\nOur lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. A variety of deposit accounts are offered with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time deposits. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations, comprehensive marketing strategy and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits.\nThe following table shows our

increase of $234.7 million, or 23.9%, compared to December 31, 2014. All deposit categories reflect increases including: time deposits of $96.5 million, or 28.2%, savings and money market deposits of $63.5 million, or 26.6%, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $45.8 million, or 16.9%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $28.9 million, or 22.4%. As part of the First Independence merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $15.2 million, interest-bearing demand and now accounts of $12.5 million, savings and money market deposits of $32.0 million and time deposits of $27.4 million. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts, excluding the impact of the merger, are primarily due to the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increases in savings and money market deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, excluding the impact of the merger, are due to our ongoing business development efforts.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2014 were $981.2 million, an increase of $33.9 million, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2013. Increases in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $51.0 million, or 23.2%, and savings and money market deposits of $6.5 million, or 2.8%, were partially offset by decreases in time deposits of $21.1 million, or 5.8%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $2.6 million, or 2.0%. The increase in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts is primarily from the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increase in savings and money market deposits was due to the increase in customer demand for shorter duration deposits and our business development efforts. The decrease in time deposits is primarily due to $13.6 million of brokered certificates of deposit maturing during 2014 and not being replaced.\nIncluded in savings and money market deposits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are brokered deposit balances of $3.9 million, $7.8 million, and $5.9 million. These balances represent customer funds placed in the Insured Cash Sweep (\u201cICS\u201d) service that allows Equity Bank to break large money-market deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other ICS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the ICS service are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding. Brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $4.2 million, $12.9 million, and $36.9 million. Of these balances, $4.2 million at December 31, 2015, $5.8 million at December 31, 2014 and $16.3 million at December 31, 2013 were customer funds placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (\u201cCDARS\u201d) program. CDARS allows Equity Bank to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other CDARS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the CDARS program are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding.\nThe following table provides information on the maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,943 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,896 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,733 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Time Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Other Borrowed Funds\nWe utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investing activities. Short-term borrowing and long-term borrowing consist of funds from the FHLB, federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements, a bank stock loan and subordinated debentures.\nThe following table presents our short-term borrowings at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Federal funds\npurchased\nand retail\nrepurchase\nagreements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FHLB\nLine of\nCredit </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>156,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2013:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements: We have available federal funds lines of credit with our correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. Retail repurchase agreements outstanding represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Retail repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We do not account for any of our repurchase agreements as sales for accounting purposes in our financial statements. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. Retail repurchase agreements are secured by investment securities held by us totaling $25.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. The agreements are on a day-to-day basis and can be terminated on demand. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had retail repurchase agreements with banking customers of $20.8 million and $25.3 million.\nFHLB advances: FHLB advances include both draws against our line of credit and fixed rate term advances. Each term advance is payable in full at its maturity date and contains provision for prepayment penalties. At December 31, 2015 we had no term advances with the FHLB. All term advances were paid in full during the first quarter of 2015 incurring $316 thousand in prepayment penalties in order to decrease future costs of funds. Our FHLB borrowings are used for operational liquidity needs for originating and purchasing loans, purchasing investments and general operating cash requirements. Our FHLB borrowings were collateralized by certain qualifying loans totaling $318.8 million at December 31, 2015. Based on this collateral and our holdings of FHLB stock, we were eligible to borrow an additional $172.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nBank stock loan: In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million from an unaffiliated financial institution, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. In September 2015, we amended and restated this loan and borrowed an additional $5.0 million. The original borrowing was to redeem the Series A and Series B preferred stock and the purpose of the additional borrowing was to provide liquidity for the purchase of First Independence Corporation. The terms of the original loan mirror the amended loan with the exception of the quarterly and final payment amounts. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% until July 2019, at which time the interest rate adjusts to Prime Rate,\nas designated as such in the \u201cMoney Rates\u201d section of The Wall Street Journal (or any generally recognized successor), floating daily. Accrued interest and principal payments are due quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October, with one final payment of unpaid principal and interest due in July 2021. The terms of the loan require the Company and Equity Bank to maintain minimum capital ratios and other covenants. The loan and accrued interest may be pre-paid at any time without penalty. In the event of default, the lender has the option to declare all outstanding balances as immediately due. The bank stock loan balance was $18.6 million at December 31, 2015 and $15.2 million at December 31, 2014. A portion of the proceeds of our IPO were used to repay this borrowing in full on January 4, 2016.\nSubordinated debentures: In conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of First Community, we assumed certain subordinated debentures owed to special purpose unconsolidated subsidiaries that are controlled by us, FCB Capital Trust II and FCB Capital Trust III, (\u201cCTII\u201d and \u201cCTIII,\u201d respectively). The trust preferred securities issued by CTII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 2.00% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on April 15, 2035 or upon earlier redemption. The trust preferred securities issued by CTIII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 1.89% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on June 15, 2037 or upon earlier redemption. The subordinated debentures balance was $9.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $8.9 million at December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for future funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, retail repurchase agreements, brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings from the FHLB and in 2015 the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering or IPO.\nOur largest sources of funds are FHLB borrowings and deposits and our largest uses of funds are the origination or purchases of loans and securities purchases. Average loans were $816.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 19.5% over average loans of $682.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excess deposits are primarily invested in our interest-bearing deposit account with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, federal funds sold or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 5.3 years and a modified duration of 4.7 years at December 31, 2015. In January 2016, $35.0 million of the proceeds from the November 2015 IPO were used to repay the bank stock loan of $18.6 million and to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock\nat liquidation preference of $16.4 million. We believe that our daily funding needs can be met through cash provided by operating activities, payments and maturities on loans and investment securities, our core deposit base and FHLB advances and other borrowing relationships. In January 2016, we entered into a lending agreement with another financial institution providing for a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. This agreement, which is secured by Equity Bank stock, can be used to fund future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nCash Flow Overview\nCash and cash equivalents were $56.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $25.1 million from the $31.7 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.6 million and the net cash provided by financing activities of $278.4 million were offset by the $266.9 million use of cash and cash equivalents for investing purposes, resulting in net proceeds of cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities was principally related to loan portfolio growth and the purchase of investment securities in excess of the cash follows generated by maturities, pay-downs, calls and sales of and settlement of securities During 2015 liquidity provided by operating activities, FHLB borrowings and deposit growth were used to grow loans by $150.6 million and purchase additional investment securities of $99.7 million, purchase additional FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock of $4.9 million and purchase premise and equipment of $5.7 million. The purchase of net non-cash assets of First Independence used $9.0 million cash and cash equivalents which was funded by available cash and $5.0 million additional borrowings on the bank stock loan\nCash and cash equivalents were $31.7 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.1 million from the $20.6 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.7 million plus the net cash provided by financing activities of $44.0 million were partially used in investing activities, with the remainder resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents. During 2014, proceeds of the $15.5 million from the bank stock loan were used to redeem a like amount of Series A and Series B preferred stock. Other funding activities, including the increase in deposits of $51.9 million and the increase in FHLB advances of $11.7 million were used for the first-quarter-2014 purchase of treasury shares and to provide funds for investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was principally for loan portfolio growth. However, an additional use of funds was the November 2014 transfer of $13.8 million to an unaffiliated financial institution in connection with the sale of two Kansas branches.\nDuring 2013, cash and cash equivalents decreased $79.8 million from $100.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $20.6 million at December 31, 2013. This decrease was principally the result of repositioning both assets and liabilities following the October 2012 acquisition of First Community Bancshares, Inc. or First Community. This repositioning included the use of $45.2 million in investing activities and the use of $50.6 million in financing activities partially offset by the $16.1 million net cash provided by operations. During 2013, we invested $101.9 million in investment securities in excess of the net cash provided by the investment securities portfolios from maturities, pay-down, calls and sales. This use of cash was partially funded by a $57.7 million decrease in the loan portfolio as we identified and disposed of First Community's problem loans. Cash was also used for repositioning liabilities, including the decrease in deposits of $43.0 million and the decrease in FHLB advances of $8.6 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur commitments associated with outstanding standby and performance letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:\nCredit Extensions Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year\nor Less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n1 Year but Less\nThan 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 Years or\nMore but Less\nThan 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years\nor More </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby and performance letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193,173 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Standby and Performance Letters of Credit: Standby letters of credit are irrevocable commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party once specified pre-conditions are met. Financial standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee performance of certain customers under non-financial contractual obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\nCommitments to Extend Credit: Commitments to originate loans and available lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments and lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment and lines of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. Mortgage loans in the process of origination represent amounts that we plan to fund within a normal period of 60 to 90 days, and which are intended for sale to investors in the secondary market.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2015 (other than securities sold under repurchase agreements). These obligations consist of our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations pursuant to FHLB advances, time deposit contracts, borrowed funds, and non-cancelable future operating leases. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts.\nOther contractual obligations represent commitments made by us to make capital investments in limited-liability entities that invest in qualified affordable housing projects. Payments on these obligations are made as requested by the managers of the limited-liability entities, however the table below includes an estimate of the anticipated timing of payments pursuant to these commitments .\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year\nor Less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n1 Year but\nLess Than\n3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 Years or\nMore but\nLess\nThan\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years or\nMore </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates and other time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>438,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank stock loan\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligation commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable future operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>622,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Resources\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution's financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. As a bank holding company and a state-chartered-Fed-member bank, the Company and Equity Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements.\nCapital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company and Equity Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.\nPrompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2015, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Equity Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Equity Bank's category.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $49.5 million, or 42.0%, compared with December 31, 2014. The increase was principally attributable to common stock issuance as part of our IPO of $38.9 million, retained earnings of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and stock based compensation of $531 thousand.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.

financial measures discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as being \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d In accordance with the SEC's rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.\nTangible Book Value Per Common Share and Tangible Book Value Per Diluted Common Share: Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in\nclause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (c) tangible book value per diluted common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding plus the period-end dilutive effects of vested restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of stock options and redemption of non-vested restricted stock units. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value.\nManagement believes that these measures are important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders' equity to tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, and diluted tangible book value per common share and compares these values with book value per common share (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: mortgage servicing asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common shares outstanding at period end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,211,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,067,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,385,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted common shares outstanding at period end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,332,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,285,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,464,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible book value per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.97 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible book value per diluted common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets: Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). For common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders' equity to total assets.\nManagement believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders' equity and total assets while not increasing tangible common equity or tangible assets.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders' equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets (dollars in thousands):\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: mortgage servicing asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,585,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,174,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,139,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: mortgage servicing asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,566,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,155,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,120,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity / assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible common equity to tangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions.

The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non-interest income.\nIn management's judgment, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess operating expenses in relation to operating revenue by removing merger expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, the efficiency ratio to the GAAP-based efficiency ratio (dollars in thousands):\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: merger expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: net gains on sales of and settlement of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: net gain on acquisition\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income, excluding net gains on security transactions and on acquisition\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense to net interest income plus non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Non-Interest Expense\nWe use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements.

generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment, by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non-interest income.\n Nonperforming assets (\u201cNPAs\u201d) include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 or more days past due, restructured loans, and other real estate acquired through foreclosure. Impaired loans do not include purchased loans that were identified upon acquisition as having experienced credit deterioration since origination (\u201cpurchased credit impaired loans\u201d or \u201cPCI loans\u201d). See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for information regarding the review of loans for determining the allowance for loan loss and impairment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, retail repurchase agreements, brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings from the FHLB and in 2015 the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering or IPO.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Pass </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Special Mention </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Doubtful </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>515,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,875 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>694,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>725,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.0 million compared with $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased provision of $1.8 million was primarily related to increased charge-offs on loans, which were partially offset by changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and the reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.5 million compared to net charge-offs of $851 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross charge-offs were $3.7 million offset by gross recoveries of $237 thousand.

Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nTable 183: <table> <tr>

Net income allocable to common stockholders was $8.3 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock were $270 thousand less for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year of 2013. The benefit to 2014 net income allocable to common stockholders of the July 2014 redemption of $15.5 million in preferred stock was partially offset by the May 2014 increase, from 5% to 9%, in the dividend rate on $14.8 million of preferred stock prior to its redemption. During 2014, increases in net interest income of $126 thousand and non-interest income of $782 thousand were offset by $1.2 million in higher non-interest expenses and the provision for income taxes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was, in the opinion of management, the result of improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio.

between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a \u201cvolume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a \u201cyield/rate change.\u201d\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>

Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the major components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n (1) Excluding loans held for sale. \nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $419 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $162 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.7 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the 2014 termination of the restricted stock unit plan, or RSUP. There was no expense associated with the RSUP for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $419 thousand decrease in total salaries and benefits expense when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects increases in salaries, commissions, incentives, bonuses and benefits totaling $1.3 million, offset by the $1.7 million reduction in stock based compensation and $55 thousand reduction in contract labor costs. The $753 thousand increase in salaries and the $239 thousand increase in commissions, incentives and bonuses reflect cost-of-living raises, increased loan production, the achievement of performance targets and an increase in the number of employees subsequent to the October 9, 2015 merger with First Independence.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was due to management's assessment as to the improved credit quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $851 thousand and $1.4 million. The decrease of $589 thousand reflected decreases in both gross charge-offs and gross recoveries when comparing the years of 2014 and 2013. Loans charged-off in 2014 totaled $1.3 million offset by $483 thousand of recoveries, compared to $2.0 million of gross charge-offs and $545 thousand of recoveries in 2013.\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.

components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nCash and cash equivalents were $56.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $25.1 million from the $31.7 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014.

If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required.\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $38.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $990 thousand, or 2.5%, compared with 2013. The decrease in loan interest income was driven by the decrease in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio remained unchanged at 5.63%. One of the factors that caused the yield on loans to remain unchanged was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans and agricultural loans. Interest income on securities was $8.0 million during 2014, an increase of $921 thousand over 2013 due to an 18 basis point increase in the average yield on the total securities portfolio and an increase in the average total securities portfolio of $13.6 million. The increases in the average yield and average volume of investment securities were primarily due to additional average volume of mortgage-backed securities of $8.0 million with an average yield of 2.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the average yield of 2.00% for the year ended December 31, 2013. We purchased additional mortgage-backed securities because this investment option provided us with a competitive yield.\nDuring 2013, cash and cash equivalents decreased $79.8 million from $100.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $20.6 million at December 31, 2013. This decrease was principally the result of repositioning both assets and liabilities following the October 2012 acquisition of First Community Bancshares, Inc. or First Community. This repositioning included the use of $45.2 million in investing activities and the use of $50.6 million in financing activities partially offset by the $16.1 million net cash provided by operations. During 2013, we invested $101.9 million in investment securities in excess of the net cash provided by the investment securities portfolios from maturities, pay-down, calls and sales. This use of cash was partially funded by a $57.7 million decrease in the loan portfolio as we identified and disposed of First Community's problem loans. Cash was also used for repositioning liabilities, including the decrease in deposits of $43.0 million and the decrease in FHLB advances of $8.6 million.\nOverview\n\n At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies or sponsored entities) for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated stockholders' equity at the reporting dates noted.\n Total deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.22 billion, an increase of $234.7 million, or 23.9%, compared to December 31, 2014. All deposit categories reflect increases including: time deposits of $96.5 million, or 28.2%, savings and money market deposits of $63.5 million, or 26.6%, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $45.8 million, or 16.9%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $28.9 million, or 22.4%. As part of the First Independence merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $15.2 million, interest-bearing demand and now accounts of $12.5 million, savings and money market deposits of $32.0 million and time deposits of $27.4 million. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts, excluding the impact of the merger, are primarily due to the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increases in savings and money market deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, excluding the impact of the merger, are due to our ongoing business development efforts.\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum\nRequired for\nCapital\nAdequacy\nPurposes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>To be Categorized as\nWell Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nCorrective Action\nProvisions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Company(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>156,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 leverage capital (to average assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Bank(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 leverage capital (to average assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.

We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). For common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders' equity to total assets.\nAvailable-For-Sale

balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAs of December 31, 2015\nThe following tables summarize the contractual maturity of debt securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately. Available-for-sale securities are shown at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are shown at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts.\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractually required payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,794 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,167 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,536 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest margin, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.65%, a decrease of 27 basis points compared with 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decline in our net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to our purchase of additional investment securities, our utilization of an available \u201cspread opportunity\u201d and the increase in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, which contributed to a decline in yield on our loan portfolio. In anticipation of consummating the acquisition of First Independence, we purchased approximately $30.0 million in investment securities to replace First Independence's investment portfolio of similar size that did not meet our investment criteria. We have since liquidated First Independence's investment portfolio. The \u201cspread opportunity\u201d involves borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions, resulting in a positive spread of approximately 25 basis points. We utilized the spread opportunity to generate income to help offset the costs associated with the First Independence merger and our initial public offering. We can reduce or terminate the spread opportunity each business day and we do not presently anticipate that this opportunity would be part of our core earnings stream or strategy. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $4.9 million, an increase in average interest-earning assets of $213.7 million and a decrease in net interest margin of 27 basis points.\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nOur commitments associated with outstanding standby and performance letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below.

The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, but is decreased by charge-offs when the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, discounted cash flows, economic conditions, and other factors including regulatory guidance. As these factors change, the amount of the loan loss provision changes.\nstockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Kansas and Missouri, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: mortgage servicing asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,585,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,174,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,139,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: mortgage servicing asset\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,566,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,155,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,120,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity / assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible common equity to tangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nSubordinated debentures: In conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of First Community, we assumed certain subordinated debentures owed to special purpose unconsolidated subsidiaries that are controlled by us, FCB Capital Trust II and FCB Capital Trust III, (\u201cCTII\u201d and \u201cCTIII,\u201d respectively).

increased to 0.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 0.13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, and 0.21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. While net charge-offs increased during 2015, $1.5 million of these gross charge-offs had been previously identified and specifically reserved for in the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014.\n \u2022 Book value per common share of $18.37 and tangible book value per common share of $15.97 at December 31, 2015. \nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation includes the following sections:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest income totaled $8.7 million, an increase of $782 thousand, or 9.9%, from $7.9 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increases in net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, mortgage banking income, other non-interest income, debit card income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, partially offset by a decrease in service charges and fees. Service charges and fees are primarily impacted by non-sufficient fund charges, which are cyclical in nature, generally fluctuate with the change in volume of transactional deposit accounts and economic conditions impacting our customers and represent a significant portion of the decrease in our service charges and fees. Service charges and fees declined $326 thousand from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $2.7 million for the comparable period of 2014, and debit card income and mortgage banking increased $126 thousand and $193 thousand for the same period. In our experience, as economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan originations during 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash receipts on zero-basis acquired loans totaled $500 thousand and $382 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $500 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity\nThe efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in the internal evaluation of our performance and is not defined under GAAP. Our efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on sales of and settlement of securities and gain on acquisition. Generally, an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nProvision for Loan Losses\n \u2022 Earnings per diluted share of $1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.30 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an 18.5% increase. \nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nBank stock loan: In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million from an unaffiliated financial institution, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. In September 2015, we amended and restated this loan and borrowed an additional $5.0 million. The original borrowing was to redeem the Series A and Series B preferred stock and the purpose of the additional borrowing was to provide liquidity for the purchase of First Independence Corporation. The terms of the original loan mirror the amended loan with the exception of the quarterly and final payment amounts. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% until July 2019, at which time the interest rate adjusts to Prime Rate,\n Analysis of allowance for loan and lease losses: At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million, or 0.57% of total loans. At December 31, 2014 the allowance for loan losses aggregated $6.0 million, or 0.82% of total loans.\n Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) average tangible common equity as total average stockholders' equity less average intangible assets and preferred stock; (b) adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders as net income allocable to common stockholders plus amortization of core deposit intangible less tax effect of amortization of core deposit intangible (tax rates used in this calculation were 35% for 2015 and 2014, and 34% for 2013) (c) return on average tangible common equity as adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders (as described in clause (b)) divided by average tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)). For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity.\nResidential real estate: Residential real estate loans include loans secured by primary or secondary personal residences. Our residential real estate portfolio totaled $250.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $115.8 million, or 86.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. During 2015, we purchased three pools of mortgage loans that represent $60.6 million of the increase that was partially offset by net payment activity in the existing residential real estate loans. During 2014, we purchased one pool of residential real estate loans totaling $26.2 million. These pools of mortgages were purchased to expand our loan portfolio and provide additional loan income. Additionally, the acquisition of First Federal added $71.3 million in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2015.\nWith respect to potential problem loans, all monitored and under-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated to determine if they are impaired. If we determine that a loan is impaired, then we evaluate the borrower's overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses based on the unlikelihood of full repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms or the net realizable value of the pledged collateral.\nPotential Problem Loans\n (1) The calculated yield is not calculated on a tax equivalent basis.  Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized and accreted over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally produce decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will reflect higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for future funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest expense totaled $35.6 million, an increase of $508 thousand, or 1.4%, compared with 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in salaries\nIn connection with our review of the loan portfolio, risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered when assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include:\nexpense is due to lower average balances and rates paid on certificates of deposit and lower average balances and rates paid on FHLB term and LOC advances, partially offset by interest expense incurred in the last six months of 2014 on the $15.5 million bank stock loan. The $51 thousand decrease in interest income is due to decreased average balances and yields on the loan portfolio, partially offset by increases in average balances and yield on the investment portfolio. The decrease in the average loan volume is associated with our efforts to improve the loan portfolio's credit quality following the merger with First Community.\nNet interest margin, for 2014 was 3.92%, an increase of five basis points compared with 3.87% for 2013. The increase in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As discussed in more detail above, net interest margin was positively impacted by the increase in loan fee income that is reflected in interest income, decreases in the rate paid on deposits and FHLB advances, and was negatively impacted by the decrease in the average loan volume for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $126 thousand, a decrease in average interest-earning assets of $11.7 million and an increase in net interest margin.\nIncome Taxes\nOther contractual obligations represent commitments made by us to make capital investments in limited-liability entities that invest in qualified affordable housing projects. Payments on these obligations are made as requested by the managers of the limited-liability entities, however the table below includes an estimate of the anticipated timing of payments pursuant to these commitments .\nGenerally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nThe following table shows our composition of deposits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Extensions Commitments\nIn management's judgment, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess operating expenses in relation to operating revenue by removing merger expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition.\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nThe following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data:\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 29 full service branches located in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $1.59 billion, total deposits of $1.22 billion, total loans held for investment of $954.8 million (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $167.2 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 million, or 14.6%.\nWe provide commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, real estate construction loans, homebuilder loans, SBA loans, agricultural and agricultural real estate loans, letters of credit and other loan products to national and regional companies, real estate developers, mortgage lenders, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. The types of loans we make to consumers include residential real estate loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, overdraft protection and letters of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\n (2) The FDIC may require the Equity Bank to maintain capital ratios above the required minimums.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nHeld-To-Maturity Securities\nContractual Obligations\nat liquidation preference of $16.4 million. We believe that our daily funding needs can be met through cash provided by operating activities, payments and maturities on loans and investment securities, our core deposit base and FHLB advances and other borrowing relationships. In January 2016, we entered into a lending agreement with another financial institution providing for a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. This agreement, which is secured by Equity Bank stock, can be used to fund future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $409 thousand, or 16.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was principally due to increased debit card processing costs as usage increased.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nour targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri and Topeka, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCash and cash equivalents were $31.7 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.1 million from the $20.6 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.7 million plus the net cash provided by financing activities of $44.0 million were partially used in investing activities, with the remainder resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents. During 2014, proceeds of the $15.5 million from the bank stock loan were used to redeem a like amount of Series A and Series B preferred stock. Other funding activities, including the increase in deposits of $51.9 million and the increase in FHLB advances of $11.7 million were used for the first-quarter-2014 purchase of treasury shares and to provide funds for investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was principally for loan portfolio growth. However, an additional use of funds was the November 2014 transfer of $13.8 million to an unaffiliated financial institution in connection with the sale of two Kansas branches.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $2.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n The risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows as of December 31, 2014:\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nRecorded Investment in Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\n \u2022 Commercial real estate loans are dependent on the industries tied to these loans as well as the local commercial real estate market. The loans are secured by the real estate, and appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. An evaluation of the project's cash flows is performed to evaluate the borrower's ability to repay the loan at the time of origination and periodically updated during the life of the loan. Residential real estate loans are affected by the local residential real estate market, the local economy, and movement in interest rates. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit reports and debt to income ratios. Appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and\n\n Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at December 31, 2015.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Our lending staff has been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. Several new lenders have been hired in our markets, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our lenders, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as community markets in both Kansas and Missouri.\nNon-Interest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax expense was $4.1 million compared with $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 28.7% and 31.9%, as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. As detailed in \u201cNOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits.\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution's financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. As a bank holding company and a state-chartered-Fed-member bank, the Company and Equity Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements.\nOur largest sources of funds are FHLB borrowings and deposits and our largest uses of funds are the origination or purchases of loans and securities purchases. Average loans were $816.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 19.5% over average loans of $682.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excess deposits are primarily invested in our interest-bearing deposit account with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, federal funds sold or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 5.3 years and a modified duration of 4.7 years at December 31, 2015. In January 2016, $35.0 million of the proceeds from the November 2015 IPO were used to repay the bank stock loan of $18.6 million and to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of available-for-sale securities as of the dates shown:\nWe utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investing activities. Short-term borrowing and long-term borrowing consist of funds from the FHLB, federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements, a bank stock loan and subordinated debentures.\n The following table shows the average deposit balance and average rate paid on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest expense totaled $38.6 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 8.2%, compared to December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to merger expenses of $1.7 million, an increase of $975 thousand in other expense, an increase of $409 thousand in data processing and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $316 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of $419 thousand in salaries and employee benefits, a decrease of $381 thousand in net occupancy expense and a decrease of $193 thousand in professional fees. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $1.8 million for 2014 and $401 thousand for 2013. The increase of $1.4 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the May 2014 termination of the RSUP. Upon termination of the RSUP the vesting of the RSU's outstanding was accelerated, the service period was shortened, and the remaining unrecognized compensation was expensed. The expense associated with the RSUP was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $303 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013. Incentives and bonuses of $1.1 million for 2014 were up $393 thousand over the $747 thousand in incentives and bonuses expense for 2013, accounting for the remaining increase in salaries and employee benefit expense.\nComposition of Loan Portfolio\nThe following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among our loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2014 were $981.2 million, an increase of $33.9 million, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2013. Increases in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $51.0 million, or 23.2%, and savings and money market deposits of $6.5 million, or 2.8%, were partially offset by decreases in time deposits of $21.1 million, or 5.8%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $2.6 million, or 2.0%. The increase in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts is primarily from the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increase in savings and money market deposits was due to the increase in customer demand for shorter duration deposits and our business development efforts. The decrease in time deposits is primarily due to $13.6 million of brokered certificates of deposit maturing during 2014 and not being replaced.\nMerger expenses: Merger expenses include legal, advisory and accounting fees associated with services to facilitate the acquisition of other banks. Merger expenses also include data processing conversion costs and costs associated with the integration of personnel, processes and facilities. On October 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of First Independence Corporation and its subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, based in Independence, Kansas. Merger expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 are related to this merger.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nWe identify certain financial measures discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as being \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d In accordance with the SEC's rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: We chose to incur a $316 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in February 2015 due to the prepayment of all our FHLB term advances. The weighted average rate of the FHLB term advances was 3.82%. To the extent that additional funding is needed our FHLB line of credit has a lower cost of funds, 0.48% at December 31, 2015.\n (2) Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets for the period. \nOther real estate owned: As detailed in \u201cNOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $418 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $131 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $526 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $505 thousand.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The majority of the decrease is due to the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in April 2015 and the construction of a new branch building in Wichita, which replaced rented space and was completed in November 2014, resulting in decreases in building rent that were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other occupancy costs increased $66 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the acquisition of First Independence and the addition of four branches in Southeast Kansas.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax expense was $4.2 million compared with $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 31.9% and 31.0%, as compared to U.S. statutory rates of 35.0% and 34.0%. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits. Beginning in 2014, our federal taxable income exceeded $10.0 million resulting in a higher U.S. statutory rate.\nNonperforming Assets\n \u2022 Total assets of $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $411.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 35.0% increase. \nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2015 notes to consolidated financial statements \u201cNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the major components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of our cash flows and capital position; and \nPotential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has concerns about the borrower's ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower's potential financial difficulties. Potential problem loans are assigned a grade of special mention or substandard . At December 31, 2015, the Company had $7.1 million in potential problem loans which were not included in either non-accrual or 90 days past due categories, compared to $20.7 million at December 31, 2014.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nIncluded in savings and money market deposits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are brokered deposit balances of $3.9 million, $7.8 million, and $5.9 million. These balances represent customer funds placed in the Insured Cash Sweep (\u201cICS\u201d) service that allows Equity Bank to break large money-market deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other ICS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the ICS service are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding. Brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $4.2 million, $12.9 million, and $36.9 million. Of these balances, $4.2 million at December 31, 2015, $5.8 million at December 31, 2014 and $16.3 million at December 31, 2013 were customer funds placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (\u201cCDARS\u201d) program. CDARS allows Equity Bank to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other CDARS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the CDARS program are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding.\nAt December 31, 2015, gross total loans were 79.0% of deposits and 60.6% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, gross total loans were 74.0% of deposits and 61.8% of total assets.\n \u2022 Financial Condition - an analysis of our financial position; \nInterest expense was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million from the $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $355 thousand from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Average certificates of deposit increased $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and the average rate increased from 0.79% to 0.90% for the same time period resulting in an increase in related interest expense of $487 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB increased by $134.5 million from an average balance of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to an average balance of $157.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $150 thousand. In February 2015, we prepaid older higher cost FHLB term advances and began using the FHLB line of credit or LOC advance option, which is pre-payable without a fee and resulted in a much lower funding cost. Interest expense on our bank stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $641 thousand compared to $295 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point to 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n \u2022 Net income allocable to common stockholders of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2014, a 22.3% increase. \nPlease see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional discussion of our allowance policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nReal estate construction: Real estate construction loans include loans made for the purpose of acquisition, development, or construction of real property, both commercial and consumer. Our real estate construction portfolio totaled $53.9 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $13.5 million, or 33.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in real estate construction loans is primarily related to increased originations.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, the efficiency ratio to the GAAP-based efficiency ratio (dollars in thousands):\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nThere are several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by lenders, and also monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.\nIn accordance with applicable regulation, appraisals or evaluations are required to independently value real estate and, as an important element, to consider when underwriting loans secured in part or in whole by real estate. The value of real estate collateral provides additional support to the borrower's credit capacity.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe\nThe risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows as of December 31, 2015:\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of nine acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nas designated as such in the \u201cMoney Rates\u201d section of The Wall Street Journal (or any generally recognized successor), floating daily. Accrued interest and principal payments are due quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October, with one final payment of unpaid principal and interest due in July 2021. The terms of the loan require the Company and Equity Bank to maintain minimum capital ratios and other covenants. The loan and accrued interest may be pre-paid at any time without penalty. In the event of default, the lender has the option to declare all outstanding balances as immediately due. The bank stock loan balance was $18.6 million at December 31, 2015 and $15.2 million at December 31, 2014. A portion of the proceeds of our IPO were used to repay this borrowing in full on January 4, 2016.\nThe contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities cause the average lives of these securities to be much different than their stated lives. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 95.8% and 87.5% of the mortgage-backed securities held by us had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 5.2 years and 4.6 years and a modified duration of 4.6 years and 4.2 years.\nPurchased credit impaired loans: We have acquired loans, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all required payments would not be collected. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nDeposits\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders' equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets (dollars in thousands):\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments were $2.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $468 thousand, or 25.8%, is related to legal matters discussed in \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and additional accounting and other professional services related to SEC registration.\nInterest income was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 13.3%. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.0 million, or 12.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan interest income was driven by the increase in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio decreased 32 basis points from 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2015. One of the factors that lessened the decrease in loan yields was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans due to increased mortgage origination and agricultural loans which were primarily prepayment and covenant breakage fees associated with a single relationship. The primary driver of the decrease in loan yields is the origination or purchase of commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage loans in a continually low interest rate environment.\nSpecial Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of our credit position at some future date.\nprimarily from increases in FHLB advances of $124.5 million, $234.7 million in total deposits, and a $3.5 million net increase in the bank stock loan; and were partially offset by decreases of $4.5 million in federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements. Our total stockholders' equity increased $49.5 million, or 42.0%, from $117.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in total stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds from the initial public offering of $38.9 million and retained earnings of $10.1 million.\nAverage Deposit Balances and Average Rate Paid\n Standby and Performance Letters of Credit: Standby letters of credit are irrevocable commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party once specified pre-conditions are met. Financial standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee performance of certain customers under non-financial contractual obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\n Year ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nThe allowance for loan losses on loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $5.2 million, or 0.55%, of the $948.9 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2015, compared to an allowance for loan losses of $4.3 million, or 0.60%, of the $711.0 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2014, and an allowance for loan losses of $4.5 million, or 0.69%, of the $647.7 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily related to a change in applied loss factors which are based in part on historical loss experience as well as changes in the composition and quality of our loan portfolio collectively evaluated for impairment. The changes in composition included purchases of broadly syndicated loans, mortgage finance loans, and residential real estate mortgage pools which have different characteristics than our originated loan portfolio at December 31, 2014.\n (1) The calculated yield is not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. \nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.5 million for 2014. An increase of $93 thousand, or 3.8%, from 2013 was due to technology enhancements during 2014.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31, as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\n Capital Resources\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for year ended December 31, 2014. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 22.3%. In July 2014, we redeemed $15.5 million of preferred stock which reduced dividends on preferred stock by $531 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014. This redemption replaced preferred stock that had a 9.0% dividend rate with a bank stock loan carrying a 4.0% interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, increases in net interest income of $4.9 million and non-interest income of $1.1 million were partially offset by $2.9 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $1.8 million in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments, were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $193 thousand, or 8.5%, principally is due to a decrease in legal fees of $505 thousand, offset by an increase in accounting fees of $92 thousand and an increase in other professional fees of $215 thousand. The decrease in legal fees was primarily due to the settlement of the lawsuit with U.S. Bank in June 2015, as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financials Statements, \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS.\u201d The offsetting increases in professional fees are principally attributable to preparing for SEC registration and the reporting requirements of a public company.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total average stockholders' equity to average tangible common equity and net income allocable to common stockholders to adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders (dollars in thousands):\nFHLB advances: FHLB advances include both draws against our line of credit and fixed rate term advances. Each term advance is payable in full at its maturity date and contains provision for prepayment penalties. At December 31, 2015 we had no term advances with the FHLB. All term advances were paid in full during the first quarter of 2015 incurring $316 thousand in prepayment penalties in order to decrease future costs of funds. Our FHLB borrowings are used for operational liquidity needs for originating and purchasing loans, purchasing investments and general operating cash requirements. Our FHLB borrowings were collateralized by certain qualifying loans totaling $318.8 million at December 31, 2015. Based on this collateral and our holdings of FHLB stock, we were eligible to borrow an additional $172.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED, other real estate owned expenses were $331 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $44 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses were $397 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $375 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2013 other real estate owned expenses were $641 thousand and gains on the sale of other real estate owned, offset by provision for unrealized losses were $484 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nWe also completed our acquisition of First Independence Corporation (\u201cFirst Independence\u201d), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, Kansas on October 9, 2015. First Independence had consolidated total assets of $135.0 million, net loans of $89.9 million (net of allowances), and total deposits of $87.1 million.\nCapital Adequacy Analysis\n \u2022 Consumer loans are dependent on the local economy. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit scores and an evaluation of debt to income ratios. \n (1) The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the prior year's volume. The changes attributable to both volume and rate, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the volume variance and the rate variance in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.  Year ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\n \u2022 Agricultural real estate loans are real estate loans related to farmland, and are affected by the value of farmland. We evaluate the borrower's ability to repay based on cash flows from farming operations. \nItem 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTangible Book Value Per Common Share and Tangible Book Value Per Diluted Common Share: Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nThe amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, the amount non-deductible expenses and available tax credits.\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 72.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in \u201cResults of Operations - Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations - Non-Interest Income.\u201d\nImpact of Inflation\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.4 million compared with $41.2 million for the prior year, an increase of $126 thousand, or 0.3%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to a $177 thousand decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest\nThe contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table:\nNet Income\nAgricultural real estate, Agricultural, Consumer and other: Agricultural real estate loans are loans related to farmland. Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. These three loan pools represent 5.3% of our overall loan portfolio.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, most of which are made to borrowers located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as various community markets throughout Kansas and Missouri. Although the portfolio is diversified and generally secured by various types of collateral, the majority of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and a substantial portion of our borrowers' ability to honor their obligations is dependent on local economic conditions in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, there was no concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding 10% of total loans.\n\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nHistory and Background\n (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. \n At December 31, 2015, loans considered pass rated credits increased to 98.4% of total loans from 95.7% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Classified loans were $15.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 51.2%, from $31.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from our continued focus on resolving classified loans in a timely manner as well as economic improvement in our principal markets.\nManagement believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders' equity and total assets while not increasing tangible common equity or tangible assets.\n The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of held-to-maturity securities as of the dates shown:\nand employee benefits, and an increase of $468 thousand in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in expenses and losses, net of gains, related to other real estate owned. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nThe table below shows the contractually required principal loan payments and the associated purchase discount on our purchased credit impaired portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015\nOur total assets increased $411.2 million, or 35.0%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2014, to $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily from increases in net loans of $234.9 million, $127.3 million in investment securities, $25.1 million in cash and equivalents and $6.7 million in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock. Included in the above changes are the assets of First Independence, which totaled $135 million at acquisition. Our total liabilities increased $361.7 million, or 34.2%, from $1.06 billion at December 31, 2014 to $1.42 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total liabilities was\nComposition of Deposits\nLoan Portfolio\nCore deposit intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nCommercial real estate: Commercial real estate loans include all loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties and by multifamily residential properties, as well as 1-4 family investment-purpose real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans were $343.1 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $19.4 million, or 6.0%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $13.0 million in commercial real estate loans acquired through First Independence. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets and principal repayment.\n \u2022 Total deposits of $1.22 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $234.7 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 23.9% increase. \nManagement believes that these measures are important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.\ncredit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nInterest expense was $5.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $177 thousand from the $5.6 million expensed in 2013. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.2 million for both 2014 and 2013. Average certificates of deposit decreased $20.3 million for 2014 compared to 2013 and the average rate decreased from 0.82% to 0.79% for the same time period resulting in a decrease in related interest expense of $294 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB decreased by $6.4 million, or 21.5%, from an average balance of $29.7 million in 2013 to an average balance of $23.3 million in 2014, resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $149 thousand. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Interest expense on the bank stock loan for the year of 2014 was $295 thousand. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\n \u2022 Overview \nFailure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2015, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Equity Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Equity Bank's category.\n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.  Overview\n Federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements: We have available federal funds lines of credit with our correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. Retail repurchase agreements outstanding represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Retail repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We do not account for any of our repurchase agreements as sales for accounting purposes in our financial statements. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. Retail repurchase agreements are secured by investment securities held by us totaling $25.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. The agreements are on a day-to-day basis and can be terminated on demand. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had retail repurchase agreements with banking customers of $20.8 million and $25.3 million.\n\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:\nCapital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company and Equity Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nEfficiency Ratio\nCash Flow Overview\nBank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. The following table provides a comparison of the Company's and Equity Bank's leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $49.5 million, or 42.0%, compared with December 31, 2014. The increase was principally attributable to common stock issuance as part of our IPO of $38.9 million, retained earnings of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and stock based compensation of $531 thousand.\n \u2022 Commercial and industrial loans are dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are advanced for equipment purchases, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business. These loans may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or other business assets. Financial information is obtained from the borrower to evaluate the debt service coverage and ability to repay the loans. \nManagement believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace because it measures the return on equity equity, exclusive of the effects of intangible assets on earnings and capital. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing average stockholders' equity and, through amortization, decreasing net income allocable to common stockholders while not increasing average tangible common equity or decreasing adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders.\n \u2022 Results of Operations - an analysis of our operating results, including disclosures about the sustainability of our earnings; \nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nNon-Interest Income\nAllowance for loan losses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest income totaled $9.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 13.0%, from $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in debit card income, the net gain on acquisition and mortgage banking income, partially offset by decreases in net gains on securities' transactions, other non-interest income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans. In our experience, favorable customer economic conditions are inversely related to non-sufficient fund charges, the largest component of service charges and fees, and are directly associated with debit card income. As economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The recognized amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired, including deferred tax assets associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards, exceeded the cash consideration exchanged in the First Independence acquisition resulting in the net gain on acquisition. Included in 2015 net gains on sales of and settlement of securities is $386 thousand received in connection with the bankruptcy settlement related to a political subdivision security written off in 2011. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $370 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with acquisitions, we received the rights to certain loans that were previously charged off by the acquired bank. At acquisition, there was no expectation of future cash flows from these previously charged-off loans and thus they were assigned a zero basis. Subsequent to the acquisitions, we have received cash payments on several of these loans. No interest has been accrued as cash flow payments have not been expected prior to receipt. Cash receipts on these zero-basis loans totaled $393 thousand and $500 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\n\n Commercial and industrial: Commercial and industrial loans include loans used to purchase fixed assets, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business. Our commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $262.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $78.9 million, or 43.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. Of this growth, $31.4 million, or 39.8%, was a result of broadly syndicated shared national credit originations and $18.9 million, or 23.9%, was a result of mortgage finance loan participation. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets, principal repayment, changes in the balances of revolving lines of credit, and loans acquired through First Independence.\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. At December 31, 2015, our gross loans held for investment portfolio totaled $960.4 million, an increase of $234.5 million, or 32.3%, compared with December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquisition of First Independence, gross loans held for investment increased by $144.6 million, or 19.9%, compared with December 31, 2014. Overall growth consisted of $115.8 million or 49.4% from residential real estate; $78.9 million or 33.7% from commercial and industrial; $19.4 million or 8.3% from commercial real estate; $13.5 million or 5.8% from real estate construction; $9.2 million or 3.9% from consumer, $1.1 million or 0.5% from agricultural real estate; but were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million or 1.5% from agricultural. We also had loans classified as held for sale totaling $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\n Other Borrowed Funds\nclause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (c) tangible book value per diluted common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding plus the period-end dilutive effects of vested restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of stock options and redemption of non-vested restricted stock units. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our short-term borrowings at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Tax exempt income is not included in the above table on a tax equivalent basis. \nThere have been no material changes to our accounting policies related to our allowance for loan loss methodology during 2015 and 2014.\nWe completed the underwritten IPO of our common stock on November 16, 2015, where we sold an aggregate of 2,231,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $22.50 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on November 11, 2015 under the ticker symbol \u201cEQBK.\u201d\n \u2022 Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced and the market pricing at the time of sale. \nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.3 million compared with $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $4.9 million, or 11.8%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due the increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest-earning assets. The increase in average volume of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in loans, investment securities and Federal funds sold and other. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 24.5%, from the interest expense of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities incurred to fund the increased volume of interest-earning assets.\nCommitments to Extend Credit: Commitments to originate loans and available lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments and lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment and lines of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. Mortgage loans in the process of origination represent amounts that we plan to fund within a normal period of 60 to 90 days, and which are intended for sale to investors in the secondary market.\nAt the date of purchase, debt and equity securities are classified into one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not purchase securities for trading purposes. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts, in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in total interest and dividend income. Also included in total interest and dividend income are dividends received on stock investments in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the FHLB of Topeka. These stock investments are stated at cost.", "item_7_text": "Non-Interest Expense\nWe use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $441.3 million, an increase of $127.3 million, or 40.6%, compared with December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, securities represented 27.8% of total assets compared with 26.7% at December 31, 2014.\nWe had $8.2 million in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015, compared with $10.8 million at December 31, 2014. The nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 consisted of 74 separate credits and 61 separate borrowers. We had two nonperforming loan relationships each with outstanding balances exceeding $1.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nUnlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest Analysis\n Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment, by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non-interest income.\n Nonperforming assets (\u201cNPAs\u201d) include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 or more days past due, restructured loans, and other real estate acquired through foreclosure. Impaired loans do not include purchased loans that were identified upon acquisition as having experienced credit deterioration since origination (\u201cpurchased credit impaired loans\u201d or \u201cPCI loans\u201d). See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for information regarding the review of loans for determining the allowance for loan loss and impairment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, retail repurchase agreements, brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings from the FHLB and in 2015 the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering or IPO.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.0 million compared with $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased provision of $1.8 million was primarily related to increased charge-offs on loans, which were partially offset by changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and the reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.5 million compared to net charge-offs of $851 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross charge-offs were $3.7 million offset by gross recoveries of $237 thousand. In comparison, gross charge-offs were $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 offset by gross recoveries of $483 thousand.\nNonaccrual Loans: Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nNet Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.0 million compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.1 million. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $8.3 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock were $270 thousand less for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year of 2013. The benefit to 2014 net income allocable to common stockholders of the July 2014 redemption of $15.5 million in preferred stock was partially offset by the May 2014 increase, from 5% to 9%, in the dividend rate on $14.8 million of preferred stock prior to its redemption. During 2014, increases in net interest income of $126 thousand and non-interest income of $782 thousand were offset by $1.2 million in higher non-interest expenses and the provision for income taxes as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was, in the opinion of management, the result of improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2015 (other than securities sold under repurchase agreements). These obligations consist of our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations pursuant to FHLB advances, time deposit contracts, borrowed funds, and non-cancelable future operating leases. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts.\nThe primary sources of non-interest income are service charges and fees, debit card income, mortgage banking income, increases in the value of bank owned life insurance, investment referral income, the recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, and net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions. Non-interest income does not include loan origination or other loan fees which are recognized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.\nFinancial Condition\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans: As a part of previous acquisitions, we acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at the amount paid, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased\n Nonperforming Assets\n (1) The Federal Reserve may require the Company to maintain capital ratios above the required minimums. \nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a \u201cvolume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a \u201cyield/rate change.\u201d\nSecurities\nThe following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:\nOur lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. A variety of deposit accounts are offered with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time deposits. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations, comprehensive marketing strategy and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits.\nAt December 31, 2014, our gross loan held for investment portfolio totaled $725.9 million, an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.9%, compared with $660.3 million at December 31, 2013. This overall growth consisted of $43.7 million, or 66.7% from commercial and industrial; $13.5 million or 20.6% from commercial real estate; $9.1 million or 13.8% from real estate construction; and $9.1 million or 13.8% from residential real estate. Growth in our gross loans held for investment portfolio was partially offset by decreases of $5.0 million or 7.6% from agricultural real estate; $4.7 million or 7.2% from agricultural; and $86 thousand or 0.1% from consumer. Other loans classified as held for sale totaled $897 thousand at December 31, 2014.\nEmerging Growth Company: Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We have irrevocably elected to adopt new accounting standards within the public company adoption period.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the major components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n (1) Excluding loans held for sale. \nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $419 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $162 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.7 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the 2014 termination of the restricted stock unit plan, or RSUP. There was no expense associated with the RSUP for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $419 thousand decrease in total salaries and benefits expense when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects increases in salaries, commissions, incentives, bonuses and benefits totaling $1.3 million, offset by the $1.7 million reduction in stock based compensation and $55 thousand reduction in contract labor costs. The $753 thousand increase in salaries and the $239 thousand increase in commissions, incentives and bonuses reflect cost-of-living raises, increased loan production, the achievement of performance targets and an increase in the number of employees subsequent to the October 9, 2015 merger with First Independence.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.2 million compared with $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was due to management's assessment as to the improved credit quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $851 thousand and $1.4 million. The decrease of $589 thousand reflected decreases in both gross charge-offs and gross recoveries when comparing the years of 2014 and 2013. Loans charged-off in 2014 totaled $1.3 million offset by $483 thousand of recoveries, compared to $2.0 million of gross charge-offs and $545 thousand of recoveries in 2013.\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually and classified based on credit risk. Consumer loans are considered pass credits unless downgraded due to payment status or reviewed as part of a larger credit relationship. We use the following definitions for risk ratings:\nOur efficiency ratio was 72.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with 72.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to increased non-interest expenses, primarily stock-based compensation associated with the RSUP termination in 2014 as discussed in \u201cResults of Operation - Non-Interest Expense.\u201d\nNon-Interest Income\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nCash and cash equivalents were $56.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $25.1 million from the $31.7 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.6 million and the net cash provided by financing activities of $278.4 million were offset by the $266.9 million use of cash and cash equivalents for investing purposes, resulting in net proceeds of cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities was principally related to loan portfolio growth and the purchase of investment securities in excess of the cash follows generated by maturities, pay-downs, calls and sales of and settlement of securities During 2015 liquidity provided by operating activities, FHLB borrowings and deposit growth were used to grow loans by $150.6 million and purchase additional investment securities of $99.7 million, purchase additional FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock of $4.9 million and purchase premise and equipment of $5.7 million. The purchase of net non-cash assets of First Independence used $9.0 million cash and cash equivalents which was funded by available cash and $5.0 million additional borrowings on the bank stock loan\nPrompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required.\nAs of December 31, 2015\n (4) Actual unrounded values are used to calculate the reported yield or rate disclosed. Accordingly, recalculations using the amounts in thousands as disclosed in this report may not produce the same amounts.  Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest yields/rates. The following table analyzes the change in volume variances and yield/rate variances for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2014 are summarized in the following table:\nInterest income was $46.8 million in each of 2014 and 2013. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $38.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $990 thousand, or 2.5%, compared with 2013. The decrease in loan interest income was driven by the decrease in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio remained unchanged at 5.63%. One of the factors that caused the yield on loans to remain unchanged was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans and agricultural loans. Interest income on securities was $8.0 million during 2014, an increase of $921 thousand over 2013 due to an 18 basis point increase in the average yield on the total securities portfolio and an increase in the average total securities portfolio of $13.6 million. The increases in the average yield and average volume of investment securities were primarily due to additional average volume of mortgage-backed securities of $8.0 million with an average yield of 2.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the average yield of 2.00% for the year ended December 31, 2013. We purchased additional mortgage-backed securities because this investment option provided us with a competitive yield.\nDuring 2013, cash and cash equivalents decreased $79.8 million from $100.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $20.6 million at December 31, 2013. This decrease was principally the result of repositioning both assets and liabilities following the October 2012 acquisition of First Community Bancshares, Inc. or First Community. This repositioning included the use of $45.2 million in investing activities and the use of $50.6 million in financing activities partially offset by the $16.1 million net cash provided by operations. During 2013, we invested $101.9 million in investment securities in excess of the net cash provided by the investment securities portfolios from maturities, pay-down, calls and sales. This use of cash was partially funded by a $57.7 million decrease in the loan portfolio as we identified and disposed of First Community's problem loans. Cash was also used for repositioning liabilities, including the decrease in deposits of $43.0 million and the decrease in FHLB advances of $8.6 million.\nOverview\n\n At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies or sponsored entities) for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated stockholders' equity at the reporting dates noted.\n Total deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.22 billion, an increase of $234.7 million, or 23.9%, compared to December 31, 2014. All deposit categories reflect increases including: time deposits of $96.5 million, or 28.2%, savings and money market deposits of $63.5 million, or 26.6%, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $45.8 million, or 16.9%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $28.9 million, or 22.4%. As part of the First Independence merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $15.2 million, interest-bearing demand and now accounts of $12.5 million, savings and money market deposits of $32.0 million and time deposits of $27.4 million. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts, excluding the impact of the merger, are primarily due to the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increases in savings and money market deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, excluding the impact of the merger, are due to our ongoing business development efforts.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. These rules became effective as applied to the Company and Equity\n Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets: Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; and (c) tangible common equity to tangible assets as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by tangible assets (as described in clause (b)). For common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is total stockholders' equity to total assets.\nAvailable-For-Sale Securities\nPass: Loans classified as pass do not have any noted weaknesses and repayment of the loan is expected.\n \u2022 Total loans held for investment of $960.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $234.5 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 32.3% increase. \nThe following table provides information on the maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAs of December 31, 2015\nThe following tables summarize the contractual maturity of debt securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately. Available-for-sale securities are shown at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are shown at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts.\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nNet interest margin, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.65%, a decrease of 27 basis points compared with 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decline in our net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to our purchase of additional investment securities, our utilization of an available \u201cspread opportunity\u201d and the increase in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, which contributed to a decline in yield on our loan portfolio. In anticipation of consummating the acquisition of First Independence, we purchased approximately $30.0 million in investment securities to replace First Independence's investment portfolio of similar size that did not meet our investment criteria. We have since liquidated First Independence's investment portfolio. The \u201cspread opportunity\u201d involves borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions, resulting in a positive spread of approximately 25 basis points. We utilized the spread opportunity to generate income to help offset the costs associated with the First Independence merger and our initial public offering. We can reduce or terminate the spread opportunity each business day and we do not presently anticipate that this opportunity would be part of our core earnings stream or strategy. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $4.9 million, an increase in average interest-earning assets of $213.7 million and a decrease in net interest margin of 27 basis points.\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nOur commitments associated with outstanding standby and performance letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of December 31, 2015 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders' equity to tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, and diluted tangible book value per common share and compares these values with book value per common share (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical estimates and assumptions; \nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $36 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses for probable incurred credit losses. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, but is decreased by charge-offs when the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, discounted cash flows, economic conditions, and other factors including regulatory guidance. As these factors change, the amount of the loan loss provision changes.\nstockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Kansas and Missouri, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\n\nSubordinated debentures: In conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of First Community, we assumed certain subordinated debentures owed to special purpose unconsolidated subsidiaries that are controlled by us, FCB Capital Trust II and FCB Capital Trust III, (\u201cCTII\u201d and \u201cCTIII,\u201d respectively). The trust preferred securities issued by CTII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 2.00% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on April 15, 2035 or upon earlier redemption. The trust preferred securities issued by CTIII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 1.89% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on June 15, 2037 or upon earlier redemption. The subordinated debentures balance was $9.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $8.9 million at December 31, 2014.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nNet losses as a percentage of average loans increased to 0.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 0.13% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, and 0.21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. While net charge-offs increased during 2015, $1.5 million of these gross charge-offs had been previously identified and specifically reserved for in the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2014.\n \u2022 Book value per common share of $18.37 and tangible book value per common share of $15.97 at December 31, 2015. \nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation includes the following sections:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest income totaled $8.7 million, an increase of $782 thousand, or 9.9%, from $7.9 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increases in net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, mortgage banking income, other non-interest income, debit card income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, partially offset by a decrease in service charges and fees. Service charges and fees are primarily impacted by non-sufficient fund charges, which are cyclical in nature, generally fluctuate with the change in volume of transactional deposit accounts and economic conditions impacting our customers and represent a significant portion of the decrease in our service charges and fees. Service charges and fees declined $326 thousand from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $2.7 million for the comparable period of 2014, and debit card income and mortgage banking increased $126 thousand and $193 thousand for the same period. In our experience, as economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan originations during 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash receipts on zero-basis acquired loans totaled $500 thousand and $382 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $500 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nLiquidity\nThe efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in the internal evaluation of our performance and is not defined under GAAP. Our efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on sales of and settlement of securities and gain on acquisition. Generally, an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nProvision for Loan Losses\n \u2022 Earnings per diluted share of $1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.30 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an 18.5% increase. \nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nBank stock loan: In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million from an unaffiliated financial institution, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. In September 2015, we amended and restated this loan and borrowed an additional $5.0 million. The original borrowing was to redeem the Series A and Series B preferred stock and the purpose of the additional borrowing was to provide liquidity for the purchase of First Independence Corporation. The terms of the original loan mirror the amended loan with the exception of the quarterly and final payment amounts. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% until July 2019, at which time the interest rate adjusts to Prime Rate,\n Analysis of allowance for loan and lease losses: At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses totaled $5.5 million, or 0.57% of total loans. At December 31, 2014 the allowance for loan losses aggregated $6.0 million, or 0.82% of total loans.\n Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) average tangible common equity as total average stockholders' equity less average intangible assets and preferred stock; (b) adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders as net income allocable to common stockholders plus amortization of core deposit intangible less tax effect of amortization of core deposit intangible (tax rates used in this calculation were 35% for 2015 and 2014, and 34% for 2013) (c) return on average tangible common equity as adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders (as described in clause (b)) divided by average tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)). For return on average tangible common equity, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average equity.\nResidential real estate: Residential real estate loans include loans secured by primary or secondary personal residences. Our residential real estate portfolio totaled $250.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $115.8 million, or 86.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. During 2015, we purchased three pools of mortgage loans that represent $60.6 million of the increase that was partially offset by net payment activity in the existing residential real estate loans. During 2014, we purchased one pool of residential real estate loans totaling $26.2 million. These pools of mortgages were purchased to expand our loan portfolio and provide additional loan income. Additionally, the acquisition of First Federal added $71.3 million in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2015.\nWith respect to potential problem loans, all monitored and under-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated to determine if they are impaired. If we determine that a loan is impaired, then we evaluate the borrower's overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses based on the unlikelihood of full repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms or the net realizable value of the pledged collateral.\nPotential Problem Loans\n (1) The calculated yield is not calculated on a tax equivalent basis.  Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized and accreted over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally produce decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will reflect higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for future funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, non-interest expense totaled $35.6 million, an increase of $508 thousand, or 1.4%, compared with 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in salaries\nIn connection with our review of the loan portfolio, risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered when assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include:\nexpense is due to lower average balances and rates paid on certificates of deposit and lower average balances and rates paid on FHLB term and LOC advances, partially offset by interest expense incurred in the last six months of 2014 on the $15.5 million bank stock loan. The $51 thousand decrease in interest income is due to decreased average balances and yields on the loan portfolio, partially offset by increases in average balances and yield on the investment portfolio. The decrease in the average loan volume is associated with our efforts to improve the loan portfolio's credit quality following the merger with First Community.\nNet interest margin, for 2014 was 3.92%, an increase of five basis points compared with 3.87% for 2013. The increase in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As discussed in more detail above, net interest margin was positively impacted by the increase in loan fee income that is reflected in interest income, decreases in the rate paid on deposits and FHLB advances, and was negatively impacted by the decrease in the average loan volume for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $126 thousand, a decrease in average interest-earning assets of $11.7 million and an increase in net interest margin.\nIncome Taxes\nOther contractual obligations represent commitments made by us to make capital investments in limited-liability entities that invest in qualified affordable housing projects. Payments on these obligations are made as requested by the managers of the limited-liability entities, however the table below includes an estimate of the anticipated timing of payments pursuant to these commitments .\nGenerally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nThe following table shows our composition of deposits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Extensions Commitments\nIn management's judgment, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess operating expenses in relation to operating revenue by removing merger expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition.\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nThe following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data:\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 29 full service branches located in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $1.59 billion, total deposits of $1.22 billion, total loans held for investment of $954.8 million (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $167.2 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 million, or 14.6%.\nWe provide commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, real estate construction loans, homebuilder loans, SBA loans, agricultural and agricultural real estate loans, letters of credit and other loan products to national and regional companies, real estate developers, mortgage lenders, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. The types of loans we make to consumers include residential real estate loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, overdraft protection and letters of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\n (2) The FDIC may require the Equity Bank to maintain capital ratios above the required minimums.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nHeld-To-Maturity Securities\nContractual Obligations\nat liquidation preference of $16.4 million. We believe that our daily funding needs can be met through cash provided by operating activities, payments and maturities on loans and investment securities, our core deposit base and FHLB advances and other borrowing relationships. In January 2016, we entered into a lending agreement with another financial institution providing for a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. This agreement, which is secured by Equity Bank stock, can be used to fund future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $409 thousand, or 16.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was principally due to increased debit card processing costs as usage increased.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nour targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri and Topeka, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCash and cash equivalents were $31.7 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.1 million from the $20.6 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.7 million plus the net cash provided by financing activities of $44.0 million were partially used in investing activities, with the remainder resulting in the increase in cash and cash equivalents. During 2014, proceeds of the $15.5 million from the bank stock loan were used to redeem a like amount of Series A and Series B preferred stock. Other funding activities, including the increase in deposits of $51.9 million and the increase in FHLB advances of $11.7 million were used for the first-quarter-2014 purchase of treasury shares and to provide funds for investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was principally for loan portfolio growth. However, an additional use of funds was the November 2014 transfer of $13.8 million to an unaffiliated financial institution in connection with the sale of two Kansas branches.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $2.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n The risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows as of December 31, 2014:\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nRecorded Investment in Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\n \u2022 Commercial real estate loans are dependent on the industries tied to these loans as well as the local commercial real estate market. The loans are secured by the real estate, and appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. An evaluation of the project's cash flows is performed to evaluate the borrower's ability to repay the loan at the time of origination and periodically updated during the life of the loan. Residential real estate loans are affected by the local residential real estate market, the local economy, and movement in interest rates. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit reports and debt to income ratios. Appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and\n\n Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 was adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at December 31, 2015.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Our lending staff has been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. Several new lenders have been hired in our markets, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our lenders, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as community markets in both Kansas and Missouri.\nNon-Interest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax expense was $4.1 million compared with $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 28.7% and 31.9%, as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. As detailed in \u201cNOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits.\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution's financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. As a bank holding company and a state-chartered-Fed-member bank, the Company and Equity Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements.\nOur largest sources of funds are FHLB borrowings and deposits and our largest uses of funds are the origination or purchases of loans and securities purchases. Average loans were $816.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 19.5% over average loans of $682.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excess deposits are primarily invested in our interest-bearing deposit account with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, federal funds sold or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 5.3 years and a modified duration of 4.7 years at December 31, 2015. In January 2016, $35.0 million of the proceeds from the November 2015 IPO were used to repay the bank stock loan of $18.6 million and to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of available-for-sale securities as of the dates shown:\nWe utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investing activities. Short-term borrowing and long-term borrowing consist of funds from the FHLB, federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements, a bank stock loan and subordinated debentures.\n The following table shows the average deposit balance and average rate paid on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest expense totaled $38.6 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 8.2%, compared to December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to merger expenses of $1.7 million, an increase of $975 thousand in other expense, an increase of $409 thousand in data processing and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $316 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of $419 thousand in salaries and employee benefits, a decrease of $381 thousand in net occupancy expense and a decrease of $193 thousand in professional fees. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $1.8 million for 2014 and $401 thousand for 2013. The increase of $1.4 million in stock based compensation is principally attributable to the May 2014 termination of the RSUP. Upon termination of the RSUP the vesting of the RSU's outstanding was accelerated, the service period was shortened, and the remaining unrecognized compensation was expensed. The expense associated with the RSUP was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $303 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013. Incentives and bonuses of $1.1 million for 2014 were up $393 thousand over the $747 thousand in incentives and bonuses expense for 2013, accounting for the remaining increase in salaries and employee benefit expense.\nComposition of Loan Portfolio\nThe following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among our loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2014 were $981.2 million, an increase of $33.9 million, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2013. Increases in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $51.0 million, or 23.2%, and savings and money market deposits of $6.5 million, or 2.8%, were partially offset by decreases in time deposits of $21.1 million, or 5.8%, and non-interest bearing demand deposits of $2.6 million, or 2.0%. The increase in interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts is primarily from the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increase in savings and money market deposits was due to the increase in customer demand for shorter duration deposits and our business development efforts. The decrease in time deposits is primarily due to $13.6 million of brokered certificates of deposit maturing during 2014 and not being replaced.\nMerger expenses: Merger expenses include legal, advisory and accounting fees associated with services to facilitate the acquisition of other banks. Merger expenses also include data processing conversion costs and costs associated with the integration of personnel, processes and facilities. On October 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of First Independence Corporation and its subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, based in Independence, Kansas. Merger expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 are related to this merger.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nWe identify certain financial measures discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as being \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d In accordance with the SEC's rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: We chose to incur a $316 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt in February 2015 due to the prepayment of all our FHLB term advances. The weighted average rate of the FHLB term advances was 3.82%. To the extent that additional funding is needed our FHLB line of credit has a lower cost of funds, 0.48% at December 31, 2015.\n (2) Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets for the period. \nOther real estate owned: As detailed in \u201cNOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $418 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $131 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $526 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $505 thousand.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The majority of the decrease is due to the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in April 2015 and the construction of a new branch building in Wichita, which replaced rented space and was completed in November 2014, resulting in decreases in building rent that were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other occupancy costs increased $66 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the acquisition of First Independence and the addition of four branches in Southeast Kansas.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax expense was $4.2 million compared with $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 31.9% and 31.0%, as compared to U.S. statutory rates of 35.0% and 34.0%. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits. Beginning in 2014, our federal taxable income exceeded $10.0 million resulting in a higher U.S. statutory rate.\nNonperforming Assets\n \u2022 Total assets of $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $411.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 35.0% increase. \nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2015 notes to consolidated financial statements \u201cNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the major components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of our cash flows and capital position; and \nPotential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has concerns about the borrower's ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower's potential financial difficulties. Potential problem loans are assigned a grade of special mention or substandard . At December 31, 2015, the Company had $7.1 million in potential problem loans which were not included in either non-accrual or 90 days past due categories, compared to $20.7 million at December 31, 2014.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nIncluded in savings and money market deposits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are brokered deposit balances of $3.9 million, $7.8 million, and $5.9 million. These balances represent customer funds placed in the Insured Cash Sweep (\u201cICS\u201d) service that allows Equity Bank to break large money-market deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other ICS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the ICS service are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding. Brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $4.2 million, $12.9 million, and $36.9 million. Of these balances, $4.2 million at December 31, 2015, $5.8 million at December 31, 2014 and $16.3 million at December 31, 2013 were customer funds placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (\u201cCDARS\u201d) program. CDARS allows Equity Bank to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other CDARS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the CDARS program are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding.\nAt December 31, 2015, gross total loans were 79.0% of deposits and 60.6% of total assets. At December 31, 2014, gross total loans were 74.0% of deposits and 61.8% of total assets.\n \u2022 Financial Condition - an analysis of our financial position; \nInterest expense was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million from the $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $355 thousand from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Average certificates of deposit increased $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and the average rate increased from 0.79% to 0.90% for the same time period resulting in an increase in related interest expense of $487 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB increased by $134.5 million from an average balance of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to an average balance of $157.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $150 thousand. In February 2015, we prepaid older higher cost FHLB term advances and began using the FHLB line of credit or LOC advance option, which is pre-payable without a fee and resulted in a much lower funding cost. Interest expense on our bank stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $641 thousand compared to $295 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point to 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n \u2022 Net income allocable to common stockholders of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2014, a 22.3% increase. \nPlease see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional discussion of our allowance policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nReal estate construction: Real estate construction loans include loans made for the purpose of acquisition, development, or construction of real property, both commercial and consumer. Our real estate construction portfolio totaled $53.9 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $13.5 million, or 33.4%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in real estate construction loans is primarily related to increased originations.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, the efficiency ratio to the GAAP-based efficiency ratio (dollars in thousands):\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nThere are several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by lenders, and also monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.\nIn accordance with applicable regulation, appraisals or evaluations are required to independently value real estate and, as an important element, to consider when underwriting loans secured in part or in whole by real estate. The value of real estate collateral provides additional support to the borrower's credit capacity.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe\nThe risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows as of December 31, 2015:\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of nine acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nas designated as such in the \u201cMoney Rates\u201d section of The Wall Street Journal (or any generally recognized successor), floating daily. Accrued interest and principal payments are due quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and October, with one final payment of unpaid principal and interest due in July 2021. The terms of the loan require the Company and Equity Bank to maintain minimum capital ratios and other covenants. The loan and accrued interest may be pre-paid at any time without penalty. In the event of default, the lender has the option to declare all outstanding balances as immediately due. The bank stock loan balance was $18.6 million at December 31, 2015 and $15.2 million at December 31, 2014. A portion of the proceeds of our IPO were used to repay this borrowing in full on January 4, 2016.\nThe contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities cause the average lives of these securities to be much different than their stated lives. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, 95.8% and 87.5% of the mortgage-backed securities held by us had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 5.2 years and 4.6 years and a modified duration of 4.6 years and 4.2 years.\nPurchased credit impaired loans: We have acquired loans, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all required payments would not be collected. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nDeposits\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total stockholders' equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets (dollars in thousands):\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments were $2.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase of $468 thousand, or 25.8%, is related to legal matters discussed in \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and additional accounting and other professional services related to SEC registration.\nInterest income was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.2 million, or 13.3%. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.0 million, or 12.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan interest income was driven by the increase in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio decreased 32 basis points from 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2015. One of the factors that lessened the decrease in loan yields was the increase in loan fees included in interest income. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan fees was primarily due to increases in fees on mortgage loans due to increased mortgage origination and agricultural loans which were primarily prepayment and covenant breakage fees associated with a single relationship. The primary driver of the decrease in loan yields is the origination or purchase of commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage loans in a continually low interest rate environment.\nSpecial Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of our credit position at some future date.\nprimarily from increases in FHLB advances of $124.5 million, $234.7 million in total deposits, and a $3.5 million net increase in the bank stock loan; and were partially offset by decreases of $4.5 million in federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements. Our total stockholders' equity increased $49.5 million, or 42.0%, from $117.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $167.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in total stockholders' equity was primarily from net proceeds from the initial public offering of $38.9 million and retained earnings of $10.1 million.\nAverage Deposit Balances and Average Rate Paid\n Standby and Performance Letters of Credit: Standby letters of credit are irrevocable commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party once specified pre-conditions are met. Financial standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee performance of certain customers under non-financial contractual obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\n Year ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nThe allowance for loan losses on loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $5.2 million, or 0.55%, of the $948.9 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2015, compared to an allowance for loan losses of $4.3 million, or 0.60%, of the $711.0 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2014, and an allowance for loan losses of $4.5 million, or 0.69%, of the $647.7 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily related to a change in applied loss factors which are based in part on historical loss experience as well as changes in the composition and quality of our loan portfolio collectively evaluated for impairment. The changes in composition included purchases of broadly syndicated loans, mortgage finance loans, and residential real estate mortgage pools which have different characteristics than our originated loan portfolio at December 31, 2014.\n (1) The calculated yield is not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. \nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $2.5 million for 2014. An increase of $93 thousand, or 3.8%, from 2013 was due to technology enhancements during 2014.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31, as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\n Capital Resources\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to $9.0 million for year ended December 31, 2014. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 22.3%. In July 2014, we redeemed $15.5 million of preferred stock which reduced dividends on preferred stock by $531 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014. This redemption replaced preferred stock that had a 9.0% dividend rate with a bank stock loan carrying a 4.0% interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, increases in net interest income of $4.9 million and non-interest income of $1.1 million were partially offset by $2.9 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $1.8 million in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments, were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $193 thousand, or 8.5%, principally is due to a decrease in legal fees of $505 thousand, offset by an increase in accounting fees of $92 thousand and an increase in other professional fees of $215 thousand. The decrease in legal fees was primarily due to the settlement of the lawsuit with U.S. Bank in June 2015, as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financials Statements, \u201cNOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS.\u201d The offsetting increases in professional fees are principally attributable to preparing for SEC registration and the reporting requirements of a public company.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total average stockholders' equity to average tangible common equity and net income allocable to common stockholders to adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders (dollars in thousands):\nFHLB advances: FHLB advances include both draws against our line of credit and fixed rate term advances. Each term advance is payable in full at its maturity date and contains provision for prepayment penalties. At December 31, 2015 we had no term advances with the FHLB. All term advances were paid in full during the first quarter of 2015 incurring $316 thousand in prepayment penalties in order to decrease future costs of funds. Our FHLB borrowings are used for operational liquidity needs for originating and purchasing loans, purchasing investments and general operating cash requirements. Our FHLB borrowings were collateralized by certain qualifying loans totaling $318.8 million at December 31, 2015. Based on this collateral and our holdings of FHLB stock, we were eligible to borrow an additional $172.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED, other real estate owned expenses were $331 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $44 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2014 other real estate owned expenses were $397 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned, including provision for unrealized losses of $375 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2013 other real estate owned expenses were $641 thousand and gains on the sale of other real estate owned, offset by provision for unrealized losses were $484 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets, losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nWe also completed our acquisition of First Independence Corporation (\u201cFirst Independence\u201d), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, Kansas on October 9, 2015. First Independence had consolidated total assets of $135.0 million, net loans of $89.9 million (net of allowances), and total deposits of $87.1 million.\nCapital Adequacy Analysis\n \u2022 Consumer loans are dependent on the local economy. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit scores and an evaluation of debt to income ratios. \n (1) The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the prior year's volume. The changes attributable to both volume and rate, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the volume variance and the rate variance in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.  Year ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\n \u2022 Agricultural real estate loans are real estate loans related to farmland, and are affected by the value of farmland. We evaluate the borrower's ability to repay based on cash flows from farming operations. \nItem 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTangible Book Value Per Common Share and Tangible Book Value Per Diluted Common Share: Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization and mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nThe amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, the amount non-deductible expenses and available tax credits.\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 72.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in \u201cResults of Operations - Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations - Non-Interest Income.\u201d\nImpact of Inflation\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.4 million compared with $41.2 million for the prior year, an increase of $126 thousand, or 0.3%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to a $177 thousand decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest\nThe contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table:\nNet Income\nAgricultural real estate, Agricultural, Consumer and other: Agricultural real estate loans are loans related to farmland. Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. These three loan pools represent 5.3% of our overall loan portfolio.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, most of which are made to borrowers located in the Wichita and Kansas City MSAs, as well as various community markets throughout Kansas and Missouri. Although the portfolio is diversified and generally secured by various types of collateral, the majority of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and a substantial portion of our borrowers' ability to honor their obligations is dependent on local economic conditions in Kansas and Missouri. As of December 31, 2015, there was no concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding 10% of total loans.\n\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nHistory and Background\n (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. \n At December 31, 2015, loans considered pass rated credits increased to 98.4% of total loans from 95.7% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Classified loans were $15.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 51.2%, from $31.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from our continued focus on resolving classified loans in a timely manner as well as economic improvement in our principal markets.\nManagement believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders' equity and total assets while not increasing tangible common equity or tangible assets.\n The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of held-to-maturity securities as of the dates shown:\nand employee benefits, and an increase of $468 thousand in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in expenses and losses, net of gains, related to other real estate owned. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nThe table below shows the contractually required principal loan payments and the associated purchase discount on our purchased credit impaired portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2015\nOur total assets increased $411.2 million, or 35.0%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2014, to $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily from increases in net loans of $234.9 million, $127.3 million in investment securities, $25.1 million in cash and equivalents and $6.7 million in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock. Included in the above changes are the assets of First Independence, which totaled $135 million at acquisition. Our total liabilities increased $361.7 million, or 34.2%, from $1.06 billion at December 31, 2014 to $1.42 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total liabilities was\nComposition of Deposits\nLoan Portfolio\nCore deposit intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nCommercial real estate: Commercial real estate loans include all loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties and by multifamily residential properties, as well as 1-4 family investment-purpose real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans were $343.1 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $19.4 million, or 6.0%, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $13.0 million in commercial real estate loans acquired through First Independence. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets and principal repayment.\n \u2022 Total deposits of $1.22 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $234.7 million as compared to December 31, 2014, a 23.9% increase. \nManagement believes that these measures are important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.\ncredit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nInterest expense was $5.4 million for 2014, a decrease of $177 thousand from the $5.6 million expensed in 2013. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $1.2 million for both 2014 and 2013. Average certificates of deposit decreased $20.3 million for 2014 compared to 2013 and the average rate decreased from 0.82% to 0.79% for the same time period resulting in a decrease in related interest expense of $294 thousand. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB decreased by $6.4 million, or 21.5%, from an average balance of $29.7 million in 2013 to an average balance of $23.3 million in 2014, resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $149 thousand. In July 2014, we borrowed $15.5 million secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The purpose of this bank stock loan was to redeem a like amount of preferred stock, which carried a 9.0% after-tax dividend rate. Interest expense on the bank stock loan for the year of 2014 was $295 thousand. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\n \u2022 Overview \nFailure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2015, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Equity Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Equity Bank's category.\n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.  Overview\n Federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements: We have available federal funds lines of credit with our correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. Retail repurchase agreements outstanding represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Retail repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We do not account for any of our repurchase agreements as sales for accounting purposes in our financial statements. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. Retail repurchase agreements are secured by investment securities held by us totaling $25.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $33.0 million at December 31, 2014. The agreements are on a day-to-day basis and can be terminated on demand. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had retail repurchase agreements with banking customers of $20.8 million and $25.3 million.\n\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated:\nCapital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company and Equity Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nEfficiency Ratio\nCash Flow Overview\nBank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. The following table provides a comparison of the Company's and Equity Bank's leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $167.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $49.5 million, or 42.0%, compared with December 31, 2014. The increase was principally attributable to common stock issuance as part of our IPO of $38.9 million, retained earnings of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and stock based compensation of $531 thousand.\n \u2022 Commercial and industrial loans are dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are advanced for equipment purchases, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business. These loans may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or other business assets. Financial information is obtained from the borrower to evaluate the debt service coverage and ability to repay the loans. \nManagement believes that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace because it measures the return on equity equity, exclusive of the effects of intangible assets on earnings and capital. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing average stockholders' equity and, through amortization, decreasing net income allocable to common stockholders while not increasing average tangible common equity or decreasing adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders.\n \u2022 Results of Operations - an analysis of our operating results, including disclosures about the sustainability of our earnings; \nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared with year ended December 31, 2013:\nNon-Interest Income\nAllowance for loan losses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest income totaled $9.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 13.0%, from $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in debit card income, the net gain on acquisition and mortgage banking income, partially offset by decreases in net gains on securities' transactions, other non-interest income and recovery of zero-basis purchased loans. In our experience, favorable customer economic conditions are inversely related to non-sufficient fund charges, the largest component of service charges and fees, and are directly associated with debit card income. As economic conditions improve, increased debit card transaction volume associated with favorable economic conditions result in increased debit card income while non-sufficient fund charges generally decrease because customers typically have more disposable income. Our mortgage banking fees increased due to greater mortgage loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The recognized amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired, including deferred tax assets associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards, exceeded the cash consideration exchanged in the First Independence acquisition resulting in the net gain on acquisition. Included in 2015 net gains on sales of and settlement of securities is $386 thousand received in connection with the bankruptcy settlement related to a political subdivision security written off in 2011. Net gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $370 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $986 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with acquisitions, we received the rights to certain loans that were previously charged off by the acquired bank. At acquisition, there was no expectation of future cash flows from these previously charged-off loans and thus they were assigned a zero basis. Subsequent to the acquisitions, we have received cash payments on several of these loans. No interest has been accrued as cash flow payments have not been expected prior to receipt. Cash receipts on these zero-basis loans totaled $393 thousand and $500 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared with year ended December 31, 2014:\n\n Commercial and industrial: Commercial and industrial loans include loans used to purchase fixed assets, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business. Our commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $262.0 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $78.9 million, or 43.1%, compared to December 31, 2014. Of this growth, $31.4 million, or 39.8%, was a result of broadly syndicated shared national credit originations and $18.9 million, or 23.9%, was a result of mortgage finance loan participation. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets, principal repayment, changes in the balances of revolving lines of credit, and loans acquired through First Independence.\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. At December 31, 2015, our gross loans held for investment portfolio totaled $960.4 million, an increase of $234.5 million, or 32.3%, compared with December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquisition of First Independence, gross loans held for investment increased by $144.6 million, or 19.9%, compared with December 31, 2014. Overall growth consisted of $115.8 million or 49.4% from residential real estate; $78.9 million or 33.7% from commercial and industrial; $19.4 million or 8.3% from commercial real estate; $13.5 million or 5.8% from real estate construction; $9.2 million or 3.9% from consumer, $1.1 million or 0.5% from agricultural real estate; but were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million or 1.5% from agricultural. We also had loans classified as held for sale totaling $3.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\n Other Borrowed Funds\nclause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (c) tangible book value per diluted common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding plus the period-end dilutive effects of vested restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of stock options and redemption of non-vested restricted stock units. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our short-term borrowings at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Tax exempt income is not included in the above table on a tax equivalent basis. \nThere have been no material changes to our accounting policies related to our allowance for loan loss methodology during 2015 and 2014.\nWe completed the underwritten IPO of our common stock on November 16, 2015, where we sold an aggregate of 2,231,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $22.50 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on November 11, 2015 under the ticker symbol \u201cEQBK.\u201d\n \u2022 Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced and the market pricing at the time of sale. \nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $46.3 million compared with $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $4.9 million, or 11.8%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due the increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest-earning assets. The increase in average volume of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in loans, investment securities and Federal funds sold and other. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 24.5%, from the interest expense of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities incurred to fund the increased volume of interest-earning assets.\nCommitments to Extend Credit: Commitments to originate loans and available lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments and lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment and lines of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. Mortgage loans in the process of origination represent amounts that we plan to fund within a normal period of 60 to 90 days, and which are intended for sale to investors in the secondary market.\nAt the date of purchase, debt and equity securities are classified into one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not purchase securities for trading purposes. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts, in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in total interest and dividend income.
