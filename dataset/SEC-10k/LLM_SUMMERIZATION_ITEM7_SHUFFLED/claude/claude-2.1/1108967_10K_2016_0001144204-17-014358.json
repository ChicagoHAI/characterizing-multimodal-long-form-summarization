Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImportant Note about Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and notes thereto included in this document and our unaudited 10-Q filings for the first three quarters of 2016 and the notes thereto. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe statements that are not historical constitute \u2018\u2018forward-looking statements.'' Said forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of such terms and phrases as \u2018\u2018expects,'' \u2018\u2018intends,'' \u2018\u2018goals,'' \u2018\u2018estimates,'' \u2018\u2018projects,'' \u2018\u2018plans,'' \u2018\u2018anticipates,'' \u2018\u2018should,'' \u2018\u2018future,'' \u2018\u2018believes,'' and \u2018\u2018scheduled.''\nThe variables, which may cause differences include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions; competition; success of operating initiatives; operating costs; advertising and promotional efforts; the existence or absence of adverse publicity; changes in business strategy or development plans; the ability to retain management; availability, terms and deployment of capital; business abilities and judgment of personnel; availability of qualified personnel; labor and employment benefit costs; availability and costs of raw materials and supplies; and changes in, or failure to comply with various government regulations. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate; therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any person that the objectives and expectations of the Company will be achieved.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nCUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998. The Company's principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment. There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and Electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants and a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S.-based website into Japanese. During the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified an indefinite-lived intangible technology rights asset for which its expected life was reduced and an impairment of $32 thousand was recorded.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, ``Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nThe Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B. The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08. On a periodic basis, we will also perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and in 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment. No impairment of goodwill was required.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflect the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options. Due to the significant changes to the Company, including the 2013 equity raise, acquisition of Orbital-UK, increased institutional ownership and other such factors that have impacted volatility, the volatility period utilized for 2014 option grant valuations used a historical period to January 1, 2013. The Company may change its expected volatility factor to include a longer historical period as the Company has remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nPower and Electromechanical segment\nProduct revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns. For one distributor that comprises 19% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns. For three other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 10% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.\nEnergy segment\nFor production-type contracts meeting the Company's minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the \u2018\u2018percentage of completion method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (\u2018\u2018ASC 605-35''). Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced. Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project. In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined. Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account. The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as \u2018\u2018Costs in excess of billings,'' an asset account, or \u2018\u2018Billings in excess of costs,'' a liability account.\nProduction type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the \u2018\u2018completed contract method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57. Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs. A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.\nFor product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nRevenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2016, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 million. Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCash used in Operations\nThere was a use of cash from operations of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This was a decrease from the use of cash from operations of approximately $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and use of cash from operations of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015. CUI-Canada's cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems North America continued to use more cash than it produces due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S. As the business matures, this operation is expected to contribute cash but not in the short term. Orbital U.K.'s cash from operations improved significantly in 2016 compared to its use of cash in operations in 2015. Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2016 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.\nDuring 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $1.3 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $1.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDuring 2016, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.3 million for inventory reserves partially offset by $0.1 million of an unrealized gain on derivative.\nDuring 2016 and 2015 and 2014, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees. For years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a total of $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower stock-based bonuses and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016. The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to less stock paid to consultants in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNegative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.4 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to negative cash flow from operations of $3.1 million for 2014. The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.\nDuring 2015, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI-Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company. Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees. Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment. The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada. Accrued expenses increased $1.8 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation. Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDuring 2015, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for provision for bad debt expense offset by $0.5 million of deferred income tax benefit.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability. A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million. Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million. At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million and increased gross profits $5.0 million, which contributed to covering operating requirements. Of this increase in revenues, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment. The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.\nFurther impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables and billings in excess of costs of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries. During 2014, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $1.3 million to costs in excess of billings associated with progress on the related projects, increased prepaid expenses of $1.0 million associated primarily with prepaid royalties increases of $0.4 million and increased prepaid taxes of $0.4 million. Unearned revenue increased $0.5 million associated with the timing of related customer orders and the terms granted. Billings in excess decreased $2.9 million during the year related to progress on Energy segment projects.\nDuring 2014, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for the unrealized loss on derivative and $0.7 million deferred income taxes benefit.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nDuring the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, CUI Global invested $0.8 million, $5.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in fixed assets. These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations. The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital. The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2017 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.\nCUI Global invested $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million in other intangible assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel. The increase to investments in 2016 was due to an increase in product certifications and an ongoing ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK. The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2017.\nThe Company did not invest in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any money from maturities in 2016. In 2015, the Company received $11.1 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company invested $12.8 million in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and received $12.4 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2014. These investments included money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes. Investments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and also setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations. This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue.\nOn March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation. The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities. CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies. The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments. In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s). The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which included the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration and had a balance of $0.1 million at December 31, 2016.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nSee, above, the section entitled Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities for a complete listing of all securities transactions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued payments of $41 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $85 thousand against the mortgage note payable. Also in 2016, the Company issued payment of $59 thousand toward the contingent liability associated with the Tectrol acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued payments of $32 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $81 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued payments of $0.1 million against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $77 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nCUI Global may raise additional capital needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations.\nFinancing activities - related party activity\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively in interest payments were made in relation to the promissory notes issued to related party, IED, Inc. The promissory note terms include a due date of May 15, 2020 and an interest rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable monthly and the principal due as a balloon payment at maturity.\nPlease see Note 9. Notes Payable and Note 13. Related Party Transactions for further discussion of these transactions.\nRecap of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company continued to invest in Orbital Gas Systems North America in Houston while the CUI-Canada operation was more fully integrated into the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As expected in the year following two major additions, cash usage was still more than what it will be when the businesses are fully mature, but improved over the year ended December 31, 2015, when the Company invested for future growth with the acquisition of its Canada operations in the Power and Electromechanical segment, the startup of its Orbital Gas Systems North America operations in the Energy segment along with the investment in the new Orbital U.K. facility. The net cash used in operating activities decreased to $0.8 million from $6.4 million in 2015 with much of that due to decreases in working capital requirements since integrating in and starting the two new operations during the prior year.\nThe Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note has a balance at December 31, 2016 of $3.4 million due, of which $89 thousand is the current portion. The Wells Fargo promissory note has an interest rate of 2% above LIBOR, payable over ten years, secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property executed by CUI Properties, LLC and guaranteed by CUI Global, Inc. In conjunction with the purchase and promissory note, Wells Fargo and the Company entered into a Swap Transaction Confirmation agreement effective October 1, 2013 that effectively maximizes the annual interest rate at 6.27%.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc. renewed its two-year revolving Line of Credit (LOC) with Wells Fargo Bank in the principal amount of $4.0 million line of credit, on October 1, 2016 for an additional two years. The interest rate on any outstanding balance is 1.75% above either the daily one month LIBOR or the LIBOR in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term. The LOC is secured through a security agreement on accounts receivable and equipment, as well as other miscellaneous personal property assets. The LOC contains certain financial covenants, one of which the Company was not in compliance with at December 31, 2016. The Company has obtained a waiver from Wells Fargo Bank for the instance of non-compliance through March 31, 2017, the next measuring date. CUI Global, Inc., the parent company, is a payment guarantor of the LOC. At December 31, 2016, there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit. Wells Fargo Bank has waived the cross-default provision on the promissory note payable owed by CUI Properties for a period beyond one year from the date of this report as it relates to the LOC covenant violation, therefore the note is not considered to be in default and continues to include a portion classified as long term.\nOn October 5, 2016, Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. signed a five-year agreement with the London branch of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. for a multi-currency variable rate overdraft facility with a facility limit of 1.5 million pounds sterling ($1.9 million at December 31, 2016) that expires on October 5, 2021. The interest rate on the facility is a base rate plus a 2.25% margin. The facility had an interest rate of 2.5% at December 31, 2016. The overdraft facility is primarily secured by land, equipment, intellectual property rights, and rights to potential future insurance proceeds held by Orbital Gas Systems Ltd.

However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operation in Houston to continue to need cash support until it can firmly establish itself. The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment acquired in 2015 will also continue to be near break even in the short-term. If revenues and the funds raised in 2012 and in April 2013 through the sales of equity are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required. There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital. The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td>

efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. Net revenues in 2016 were generally consistent compared to 2015 but would have been more significantly improved except for lower translated Orbital U.K. operations as a result of falling foreign currency rates in the U.K. following the Brexit vote. However, the lower rates did not have a significant effect on operating or net income.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.1 million compared to approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2015. In 2016, the Energy segment's Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary completed its first full year of operations and made progress on its goals of self-sustainability with four consecutive quarters of revenue growth. The Company intends to grow this product line to become a major portion of Orbital's revenue going forward.\nCUI, Inc. introduced 968 new products during the year ended 2016 compared to 838 new products during the year ended 2015. The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI's sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.\n2015 compared to 2014\nRevenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, and the addition in March 2015 of CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, the addition of a third distribution channel, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI-Canada.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014.

The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to the offsetting factors of improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment, which were offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment. As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 5 percentage points from 63% to 58%. This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 65% from 63%.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe increase to costs of revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily the result of the increase in sales. The decrease in the Energy segment was due to a better product mix in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects that had increased costs during 2014. As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.6% compared to 62.5% for 2014. The consolidated cost of revenues was consistent as a percent of revenues due to offsetting factors. The Power and Electromechanical segment had higher costs as a percent of revenues in 2015 due to higher costs as we transitioned manufacturing to our new Canada plant while the Energy segment had lower costs as a percent of revenues due to the improved product mix and cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>Selling, General, and Administrative Expense by Segment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Power and Electromechanical </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,924 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses includes such items as wages, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A increased $1.2 million compared to the prior-year comparative period. The increase for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R&D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased audit and accounting fees in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $0.7 million, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG&A. Partially offsetting the increased SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.3 million decrease in non-severance-related SG&A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations. The remaining increases in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, ICE Block, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions partially offset by foreign currency translation decreases at Orbital-UK. SG&A increased to 40% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2015 compared to 2014\nFor year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, SG&A expenses increased $7.1 million. The increase during 2015 is primarily associated with the addition of the SG&A activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in Houston, Texas in January 2015 and accounted for approximately $4.0 million of additional SG&A. Partially offsetting this increase in the Energy segment expense was a $0.7 million charge during the third quarter of 2014 of equity compensation expense for strategic consulting services that did not recur in 2015. In addition, the operations related to CUI-Canada, which was acquired in March 2015, accounted for approximately $1.1 million of the increase in SG&A during the period. The remaining increases in SG&A are associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote our product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A increased during 2015 to 38% from 34% during the prior-year comparable period due primarily to the additional costs related to the new operations in Houston and Canada.\nThe Company anticipates the amount of our sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with 2016 levels.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>Depreciation and Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Power and Electromechanical </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

The Company expects that 2017 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.\nImpairment Loss\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.

The Company discontinued the equity method of accounting for its investment as of October 1, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019. The Company recorded $19 thousand of interest income from the note in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales. Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly. CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary. For more information on this investment, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment and Note Receivable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million of interest expense during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and bank working capital loans. The decrease in 2015 is due primarily to interest capitalized as part of the construction of the manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the U.K. for Orbital. See Note 15, Capitalized Interest, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nProvision (benefit) for taxes\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is more likely than not. In 2016, a net expense of $38 thousand, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.5%) compared to a $0.4 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an effective tax rate of 6.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on profitable foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $56.6 million, $55.1 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, and for which the Federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2018 and 2036.\nSee Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" of the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part II - Item 8, \"Financial Statements and supplementary data.\"\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared to 2014\nA net benefit of $0.4 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting in an effective tax rate of 6.4% for the year. Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.7 million and 20.6%, respectively for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 and 2014 relates primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.\nConsolidated Net Loss\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe Company had a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2016 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses, and increased tax expense.\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe Company had a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated net loss for 2015 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the opening of the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. facility in January 2015 and the addition of CUI-Canada, Inc. in March 2015 as well as the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital-UK acquisition and Tectrol, Inc. acquisition.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''", "item_7_truncated": "During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued payments of $41 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $85 thousand against the mortgage note payable. Also in 2016, the Company issued payment of $59 thousand toward the contingent liability associated with the Tectrol acquisition.\nDuring 2015, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for provision for bad debt expense offset by $0.5 million of deferred income tax benefit.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $96.0 million.\nDuring 2016 and 2015 and 2014, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees. For years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a total of $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower stock-based bonuses and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016. The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to less stock paid to consultants in 2015 compared to 2014.\nDuring 2014, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for the unrealized loss on derivative and $0.7 million deferred income taxes benefit.\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>Depreciation and Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Power and Electromechanical </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment. There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and Electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants and a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S.-based website into Japanese. During the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified an indefinite-lived intangible technology rights asset for which its expected life was reduced and an impairment of $32 thousand was recorded.\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nChange

October 1, 2016 for an additional two years. The interest rate on any outstanding balance is 1.75% above either the daily one month LIBOR or the LIBOR in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term. The LOC is secured through a security agreement on accounts receivable and equipment, as well as other miscellaneous personal property assets. The LOC contains certain financial covenants, one of which the Company was not in compliance with at December 31, 2016. The Company has obtained a waiver from Wells Fargo Bank for the instance of non-compliance through March 31, 2017, the next measuring date. CUI Global, Inc., the parent company, is a payment guarantor of the LOC. At December 31, 2016, there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit. Wells Fargo Bank has waived the cross-default provision on the promissory note payable owed by CUI Properties for a period beyond one year from the date of this report as it relates to the LOC covenant violation, therefore the note is not considered to be in default and continues to include a portion classified as long term.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>Cost of Revenues by Segment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Power and Electromechanical </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,334 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,160 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998.

respectively, in fixed assets. These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations. The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital. The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2017 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCost of Revenue\n2016 compared to 2015\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2015 compared to 2014\nAs of December 31, 2016, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 million. Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 35 \n\nCUI, Inc. introduced 838 new products during the year ended 2015 compared to 937 new products during the year ended 2014.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nImpairment Loss\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\nThere was a use of cash from operations of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This was a decrease from the use of cash from operations of approximately $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and use of cash from operations of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\n 39 \nFinancing activities - related party activity\nThe 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability. A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million. Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million. At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million and increased gross profits $5.0 million, which contributed to covering operating requirements. Of this increase in revenues, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment. The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.\n 42 \nNegative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.4 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to negative cash flow from operations of $3.1 million for 2014. The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.\n\nGeneral\nEnergy segment\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents balances of $4.6 million. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts, $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses includes such items as wages, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.\nThe following tables present our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands)\nBad debt expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 represents less than \u00bd% of total revenues and relates to miscellaneous receivables, which the Company has either recorded an allowance for doubtful collections of the receivable or for which the Company has determined the balance to be uncollectible.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is more likely than not. In 2016, a net expense of $38 thousand, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.5%) compared to a $0.4 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an effective tax rate of 6.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on profitable foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $56.6 million, $55.1 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, and for which the Federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2018 and 2036.\nSee, above, the section entitled Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities for a complete listing of all securities transactions.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflect the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options. Due to the significant changes to the Company, including the 2013 equity raise, acquisition of Orbital-UK, increased institutional ownership and other such factors that have impacted volatility, the volatility period utilized for 2014 option grant valuations used a historical period to January 1, 2013. The Company may change its expected volatility factor to include a longer historical period as the Company has remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.\n2015 compared to 2014\nCUI Global may raise additional capital needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations.\n2016 compared to 2015\nCUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nDuring 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $1.3 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $1.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nFor production-type contracts meeting the Company's minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the \u2018\u2018percentage of completion method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (\u2018\u2018ASC 605-35''). Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced. Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project. In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined. Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account. The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as \u2018\u2018Costs in excess of billings,'' an asset account, or \u2018\u2018Billings in excess of costs,'' a liability account.\n\nThe Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015.\nPower and Electromechanical segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued payments of $32 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $81 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nThe Company had a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2016 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses, and increased tax expense.\n 31 \nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nAsset Impairment\nCash used in Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally. The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, ICE Block, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE technologies. The Company expects that 2017 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any person that the objectives and expectations of the Company will be achieved.\nDuring 2016, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.3 million for inventory reserves partially offset by $0.1 million of an unrealized gain on derivative.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, Orbital held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million compared to approximately $15.9 million as of December 31, 2014.\n 33 \nOn March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation. The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities. CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies. The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments. In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s). The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which included the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration and had a balance of $0.1 million at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A increased $1.2 million compared to the prior-year comparative period. The increase for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R&D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased audit and accounting fees in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $0.7 million, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG&A. Partially offsetting the increased SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.3 million decrease in non-severance-related SG&A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations. The remaining increases in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, ICE Block, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions partially offset by foreign currency translation decreases at Orbital-UK. SG&A increased to 40% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn October 5, 2016, Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. signed a five-year agreement with the London branch of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. for a multi-currency variable rate overdraft facility with a facility limit of 1.5 million pounds sterling ($1.9 million at December 31, 2016) that expires on October 5, 2021. The interest rate on the facility is a base rate plus a 2.25% margin. The facility had an interest rate of 2.5% at December 31, 2016. The overdraft facility is primarily secured by land, equipment, intellectual property rights, and rights to potential future insurance proceeds held by Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. At December 31, 2016, there was no balance outstanding on the overdraft facility.\n2015 compared to 2014\n 40 \nFor product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nConsolidated Net Loss\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\n2016 compared to 2015\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company expects the revenues from its Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments to help cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations. However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operation in Houston to continue to need cash support until it can firmly establish itself. The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment acquired in 2015 will also continue to be near break even in the short-term. If revenues and the funds raised in 2012 and in April 2013 through the sales of equity are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required. There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital. The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.1 million compared to approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2015. In 2016, the Energy segment's Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary completed its first full year of operations and made progress on its goals of self-sustainability with four consecutive quarters of revenue growth. The Company intends to grow this product line to become a major portion of Orbital's revenue going forward.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nProduction type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the \u2018\u2018completed contract method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57. Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs. A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.\nThe depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The above table includes $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively that was included in cost of sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment and less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales in the Energy segment in both 2015 and 2014.\nCUI, Inc. introduced 968 new products during the year ended 2016 compared to 838 new products during the year ended 2015. The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI's sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.\n\nRevenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, and the addition in March 2015 of CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.\n 30 \nDepreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015 and U.K. assets were depreciated at lower foreign currency rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2016 and the purchase of CUI-Canada in March 2015, which meant that 2016 had two more months of CUI-Canada depreciation than in 2015.\nThe Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B. The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued payments of $0.1 million against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $77 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nThe Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note has a balance at December 31, 2016 of $3.4 million due, of which $89 thousand is the current portion. The Wells Fargo promissory note has an interest rate of 2% above LIBOR, payable over ten years, secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property executed by CUI Properties, LLC and guaranteed by CUI Global, Inc. In conjunction with the purchase and promissory note, Wells Fargo and the Company entered into a Swap Transaction Confirmation agreement effective October 1, 2013 that effectively maximizes the annual interest rate at 6.27%.\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.\n2016 compared to 2015\nProduct revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns. For one distributor that comprises 19% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns. For three other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 10% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.\n\nImportant Note about Forward-Looking Statements\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2016 compared to 2015\n 38 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company anticipates the amount of our sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with 2016 levels.\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 63% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to the offsetting factors of improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment, which were offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment. As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 5 percentage points from 63% to 58%. This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 65% from 63%.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\n 41 \nOverview\n\nThe Company did not invest in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any money from maturities in 2016. In 2015, the Company received $11.1 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company invested $12.8 million in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and received $12.4 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2014. These investments included money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes. Investments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and also setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations. This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue.\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively in interest payments were made in relation to the promissory notes issued to related party, IED, Inc. The promissory note terms include a due date of May 15, 2020 and an interest rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable monthly and the principal due as a balloon payment at maturity.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information regarding revenue and costs by segment.\n2015 compared to 2014\n 29 \nThe customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, the addition of a third distribution channel, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI-Canada.\n 37 \nThe increase to costs of revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily the result of the increase in sales. The decrease in the Energy segment was due to a better product mix in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects that had increased costs during 2014. As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.6% compared to 62.5% for 2014. The consolidated cost of revenues was consistent as a percent of revenues due to offsetting factors. The Power and Electromechanical segment had higher costs as a percent of revenues in 2015 due to higher costs as we transitioned manufacturing to our new Canada plant while the Energy segment had lower costs as a percent of revenues due to the improved product mix and cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, ``Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nThe Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million of interest expense during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and bank working capital loans. The decrease in 2015 is due primarily to interest capitalized as part of the construction of the manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the U.K. for Orbital. See Note 15, Capitalized Interest, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPlease see Note 9. Notes Payable and Note 13. Related Party Transactions for further discussion of these transactions.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and notes thereto included in this document and our unaudited 10-Q filings for the first three quarters of 2016 and the notes thereto. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n(1) The interest on notes payable includes fixed interest on the related party note payable to IED, Inc. It does not include the variable interest on the mortgage payable. For further information regarding notes payable see Note 9 - Notes Payable.\nFor year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, SG&A expenses increased $7.1 million. The increase during 2015 is primarily associated with the addition of the SG&A activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in Houston, Texas in January 2015 and accounted for approximately $4.0 million of additional SG&A. Partially offsetting this increase in the Energy segment expense was a $0.7 million charge during the third quarter of 2014 of equity compensation expense for strategic consulting services that did not recur in 2015. In addition, the operations related to CUI-Canada, which was acquired in March 2015, accounted for approximately $1.1 million of the increase in SG&A during the period. The remaining increases in SG&A are associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote our product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A increased during 2015 to 38% from 34% during the prior-year comparable period due primarily to the additional costs related to the new operations in Houston and Canada.\nInterest Expense\n 32 \nRevenues in 2016 are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. Net revenues in 2016 were generally consistent compared to 2015 but would have been more significantly improved except for lower translated Orbital U.K. operations as a result of falling foreign currency rates in the U.K. following the Brexit vote. However, the lower rates did not have a significant effect on operating or net income.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment. There were approximately $0, $4 thousand, and $32 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08. On a periodic basis, we will also perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and in 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment. No impairment of goodwill was required.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company continued to invest in Orbital Gas Systems North America in Houston while the CUI-Canada operation was more fully integrated into the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As expected in the year following two major additions, cash usage was still more than what it will be when the businesses are fully mature, but improved over the year ended December 31, 2015, when the Company invested for future growth with the acquisition of its Canada operations in the Power and Electromechanical segment, the startup of its Orbital Gas Systems North America operations in the Energy segment along with the investment in the new Orbital U.K. facility. The net cash used in operating activities decreased to $0.8 million from $6.4 million in 2015 with much of that due to decreases in working capital requirements since integrating in and starting the two new operations during the prior year.\nRevenue\nFurther impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables and billings in excess of costs of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries. During 2014, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $1.3 million to costs in excess of billings associated with progress on the related projects, increased prepaid expenses of $1.0 million associated primarily with prepaid royalties increases of $0.4 million and increased prepaid taxes of $0.4 million. Unearned revenue increased $0.5 million associated with the timing of related customer orders and the terms granted. Billings in excess decreased $2.9 million during the year related to progress on Energy segment projects.\n 34 \nInvestment Income\n\nThe Company had a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated net loss for 2015 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the opening of the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. facility in January 2015 and the addition of CUI-Canada, Inc. in March 2015 as well as the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital-UK acquisition and Tectrol, Inc. acquisition.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company recognized investment income on equity investment in an affiliate of $0 in 2016, $53 thousand in the first 9 months of 2015 and, $49 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company discontinued the equity method of accounting for its investment as of October 1, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019. The Company recorded $19 thousand of interest income from the note in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales. Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly. CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary. For more information on this investment, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment and Note Receivable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''\n2015 compared to 2014\nResults of Operations\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nRevenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015. CUI-Canada's cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems North America continued to use more cash than it produces due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S. As the business matures, this operation is expected to contribute cash but not in the short term. Orbital U.K.'s cash from operations improved significantly in 2016 compared to its use of cash in operations in 2015. Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2016 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.\nProvision (benefit) for taxes\nA net benefit of $0.4 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting in an effective tax rate of 6.4% for the year. Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.7 million and 20.6%, respectively for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 and 2014 relates primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.\nCUI Global invested $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million in other intangible assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel. The increase to investments in 2016 was due to an increase in product certifications and an ongoing ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK. The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2017.\nRecap of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income (expense)\nDuring 2015, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI-Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company. Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees. Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment. The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada. Accrued expenses increased $1.8 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation. Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.", "item_7_text": "During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued payments of $41 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $85 thousand against the mortgage note payable. Also in 2016, the Company issued payment of $59 thousand toward the contingent liability associated with the Tectrol acquisition.\nDuring 2015, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for provision for bad debt expense offset by $0.5 million of deferred income tax benefit.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $96.0 million.\nDuring 2016 and 2015 and 2014, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees. For years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a total of $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower stock-based bonuses and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016. The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to less stock paid to consultants in 2015 compared to 2014.\nDuring 2014, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for the unrealized loss on derivative and $0.7 million deferred income taxes benefit.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment. There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and Electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants and a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S.-based website into Japanese. During the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified an indefinite-lived intangible technology rights asset for which its expected life was reduced and an impairment of $32 thousand was recorded.\n 36 \n2015 compared to 2014\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc. renewed its two-year revolving Line of Credit (LOC) with Wells Fargo Bank in the principal amount of $4.0 million line of credit, on October 1, 2016 for an additional two years. The interest rate on any outstanding balance is 1.75% above either the daily one month LIBOR or the LIBOR in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term. The LOC is secured through a security agreement on accounts receivable and equipment, as well as other miscellaneous personal property assets. The LOC contains certain financial covenants, one of which the Company was not in compliance with at December 31, 2016. The Company has obtained a waiver from Wells Fargo Bank for the instance of non-compliance through March 31, 2017, the next measuring date. CUI Global, Inc., the parent company, is a payment guarantor of the LOC. At December 31, 2016, there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit. Wells Fargo Bank has waived the cross-default provision on the promissory note payable owed by CUI Properties for a period beyond one year from the date of this report as it relates to the LOC covenant violation, therefore the note is not considered to be in default and continues to include a portion classified as long term.\nCUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998. The Company's principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.\nThe variables, which may cause differences include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions; competition; success of operating initiatives; operating costs; advertising and promotional efforts; the existence or absence of adverse publicity; changes in business strategy or development plans; the ability to retain management; availability, terms and deployment of capital; business abilities and judgment of personnel; availability of qualified personnel; labor and employment benefit costs; availability and costs of raw materials and supplies; and changes in, or failure to comply with various government regulations.

These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations. The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital. The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2017 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCost of Revenue\n2016 compared to 2015\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2015 compared to 2014\nAs of December 31, 2016, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 million. Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 35 \n\nCUI, Inc. introduced 838 new products during the year ended 2015 compared to 937 new products during the year ended 2014.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nImpairment Loss\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\nThere was a use of cash from operations of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This was a decrease from the use of cash from operations of approximately $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and use of cash from operations of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\n 39 \nFinancing activities - related party activity\nThe 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability. A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million. Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million. At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million and increased gross profits $5.0 million, which contributed to covering operating requirements. Of this increase in revenues, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment. The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.\n 42 \nNegative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.4 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to negative cash flow from operations of $3.1 million for 2014. The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.\n\nGeneral\nEnergy segment\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents balances of $4.6 million. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts, $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses includes such items as wages, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.\nThe following tables present our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands)\nBad debt expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 represents less than \u00bd% of total revenues and relates to miscellaneous receivables, which the Company has either recorded an allowance for doubtful collections of the receivable or for which the Company has determined the balance to be uncollectible.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is more likely than not. In 2016, a net expense of $38 thousand, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.5%) compared to a $0.4 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an effective tax rate of 6.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on profitable foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $56.6 million, $55.1 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, and for which the Federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2018 and 2036.\nSee, above, the section entitled Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities for a complete listing of all securities transactions.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflect the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options. Due to the significant changes to the Company, including the 2013 equity raise, acquisition of Orbital-UK, increased institutional ownership and other such factors that have impacted volatility, the volatility period utilized for 2014 option grant valuations used a historical period to January 1, 2013. The Company may change its expected volatility factor to include a longer historical period as the Company has remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.\n2015 compared to 2014\nCUI Global may raise additional capital needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations.\n2016 compared to 2015\nCUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nDuring 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $1.3 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $1.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nFor production-type contracts meeting the Company's minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the \u2018\u2018percentage of completion method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (\u2018\u2018ASC 605-35''). Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced. Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project. In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined. Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account. The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as \u2018\u2018Costs in excess of billings,'' an asset account, or \u2018\u2018Billings in excess of costs,'' a liability account.\n\nThe Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015.\nPower and Electromechanical segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued payments of $32 thousand against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $81 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nThe Company had a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2016 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses, and increased tax expense.\n 31 \nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nAsset Impairment\nCash used in Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally. The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, ICE Block, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE technologies. The Company expects that 2017 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any person that the objectives and expectations of the Company will be achieved.\nDuring 2016, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.3 million for inventory reserves partially offset by $0.1 million of an unrealized gain on derivative.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, Orbital held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million compared to approximately $15.9 million as of December 31, 2014.\n 33 \nOn March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation. The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities. CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies. The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments. In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s). The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which included the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration and had a balance of $0.1 million at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A increased $1.2 million compared to the prior-year comparative period. The increase for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R&D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased audit and accounting fees in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $0.7 million, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG&A. Partially offsetting the increased SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.3 million decrease in non-severance-related SG&A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations. The remaining increases in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, ICE Block, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions partially offset by foreign currency translation decreases at Orbital-UK. SG&A increased to 40% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn October 5, 2016, Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. signed a five-year agreement with the London branch of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. for a multi-currency variable rate overdraft facility with a facility limit of 1.5 million pounds sterling ($1.9 million at December 31, 2016) that expires on October 5, 2021. The interest rate on the facility is a base rate plus a 2.25% margin. The facility had an interest rate of 2.5% at December 31, 2016. The overdraft facility is primarily secured by land, equipment, intellectual property rights, and rights to potential future insurance proceeds held by Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. At December 31, 2016, there was no balance outstanding on the overdraft facility.\n2015 compared to 2014\n 40 \nFor product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nConsolidated Net Loss\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\n2016 compared to 2015\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company expects the revenues from its Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments to help cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations. However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operation in Houston to continue to need cash support until it can firmly establish itself. The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment acquired in 2015 will also continue to be near break even in the short-term. If revenues and the funds raised in 2012 and in April 2013 through the sales of equity are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required. There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital. The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.1 million compared to approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2015. In 2016, the Energy segment's Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary completed its first full year of operations and made progress on its goals of self-sustainability with four consecutive quarters of revenue growth. The Company intends to grow this product line to become a major portion of Orbital's revenue going forward.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nProduction type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the \u2018\u2018completed contract method'' of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57. Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs. A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.\nThe depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The above table includes $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively that was included in cost of sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment and less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales in the Energy segment in both 2015 and 2014.\nCUI, Inc. introduced 968 new products during the year ended 2016 compared to 838 new products during the year ended 2015. The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI's sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.\n\nRevenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, and the addition in March 2015 of CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.\n 30 \nDepreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015 and U.K. assets were depreciated at lower foreign currency rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2016 and the purchase of CUI-Canada in March 2015, which meant that 2016 had two more months of CUI-Canada depreciation than in 2015.\nThe Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B. The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued payments of $0.1 million against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment and $77 thousand against the mortgage note payable.\nThe Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note has a balance at December 31, 2016 of $3.4 million due, of which $89 thousand is the current portion. The Wells Fargo promissory note has an interest rate of 2% above LIBOR, payable over ten years, secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property executed by CUI Properties, LLC and guaranteed by CUI Global, Inc. In conjunction with the purchase and promissory note, Wells Fargo and the Company entered into a Swap Transaction Confirmation agreement effective October 1, 2013 that effectively maximizes the annual interest rate at 6.27%.\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.\n2016 compared to 2015\nProduct revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns. For one distributor that comprises 19% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns. For three other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 10% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.\n\nImportant Note about Forward-Looking Statements\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2016 compared to 2015\n 38 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company anticipates the amount of our sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with 2016 levels.\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 63% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to the offsetting factors of improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment, which were offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment. As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 5 percentage points from 63% to 58%. This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 65% from 63%.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\n 41 \nOverview\n\nThe Company did not invest in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any money from maturities in 2016. In 2015, the Company received $11.1 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company invested $12.8 million in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and received $12.4 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2014. These investments included money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes. Investments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and also setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations. This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue.\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively in interest payments were made in relation to the promissory notes issued to related party, IED, Inc. The promissory note terms include a due date of May 15, 2020 and an interest rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable monthly and the principal due as a balloon payment at maturity.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information regarding revenue and costs by segment.\n2015 compared to 2014\n 29 \nThe customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, the addition of a third distribution channel, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI-Canada.\n 37 \nThe increase to costs of revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily the result of the increase in sales. The decrease in the Energy segment was due to a better product mix in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects that had increased costs during 2014. As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.6% compared to 62.5% for 2014. The consolidated cost of revenues was consistent as a percent of revenues due to offsetting factors. The Power and Electromechanical segment had higher costs as a percent of revenues in 2015 due to higher costs as we transitioned manufacturing to our new Canada plant while the Energy segment had lower costs as a percent of revenues due to the improved product mix and cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, ``Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nThe Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million of interest expense during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and bank working capital loans. The decrease in 2015 is due primarily to interest capitalized as part of the construction of the manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the U.K. for Orbital. See Note 15, Capitalized Interest, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPlease see Note 9. Notes Payable and Note 13. Related Party Transactions for further discussion of these transactions.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and notes thereto included in this document and our unaudited 10-Q filings for the first three quarters of 2016 and the notes thereto. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n(1) The interest on notes payable includes fixed interest on the related party note payable to IED, Inc. It does not include the variable interest on the mortgage payable. For further information regarding notes payable see Note 9 - Notes Payable.\nFor year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, SG&A expenses increased $7.1 million. The increase during 2015 is primarily associated with the addition of the SG&A activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in Houston, Texas in January 2015 and accounted for approximately $4.0 million of additional SG&A. Partially offsetting this increase in the Energy segment expense was a $0.7 million charge during the third quarter of 2014 of equity compensation expense for strategic consulting services that did not recur in 2015. In addition, the operations related to CUI-Canada, which was acquired in March 2015, accounted for approximately $1.1 million of the increase in SG&A during the period. The remaining increases in SG&A are associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote our product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A increased during 2015 to 38% from 34% during the prior-year comparable period due primarily to the additional costs related to the new operations in Houston and Canada.\nInterest Expense\n 32 \nRevenues in 2016 are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. Net revenues in 2016 were generally consistent compared to 2015 but would have been more significantly improved except for lower translated Orbital U.K. operations as a result of falling foreign currency rates in the U.K. following the Brexit vote. However, the lower rates did not have a significant effect on operating or net income.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment. There were approximately $0, $4 thousand, and $32 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08. On a periodic basis, we will also perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and in 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment. No impairment of goodwill was required.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company continued to invest in Orbital Gas Systems North America in Houston while the CUI-Canada operation was more fully integrated into the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As expected in the year following two major additions, cash usage was still more than what it will be when the businesses are fully mature, but improved over the year ended December 31, 2015, when the Company invested for future growth with the acquisition of its Canada operations in the Power and Electromechanical segment, the startup of its Orbital Gas Systems North America operations in the Energy segment along with the investment in the new Orbital U.K. facility. The net cash used in operating activities decreased to $0.8 million from $6.4 million in 2015 with much of that due to decreases in working capital requirements since integrating in and starting the two new operations during the prior year.\nRevenue\nFurther impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables and billings in excess of costs of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries. During 2014, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $1.3 million to costs in excess of billings associated with progress on the related projects, increased prepaid expenses of $1.0 million associated primarily with prepaid royalties increases of $0.4 million and increased prepaid taxes of $0.4 million. Unearned revenue increased $0.5 million associated with the timing of related customer orders and the terms granted. Billings in excess decreased $2.9 million during the year related to progress on Energy segment projects.\n 34 \nInvestment Income\n\nThe Company had a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated net loss for 2015 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the opening of the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. facility in January 2015 and the addition of CUI-Canada, Inc. in March 2015 as well as the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital-UK acquisition and Tectrol, Inc. acquisition.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company recognized investment income on equity investment in an affiliate of $0 in 2016, $53 thousand in the first 9 months of 2015 and, $49 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company discontinued the equity method of accounting for its investment as of October 1, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019. The Company recorded $19 thousand of interest income from the note in the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales. Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly. CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary. For more information on this investment, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment and Note Receivable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''\n2015 compared to 2014\nResults of Operations\n2016 compared to 2015\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nRevenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015. CUI-Canada's cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems North America continued to use more cash than it produces due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S. As the business matures, this operation is expected to contribute cash but not in the short term. Orbital U.K.'s cash from operations improved significantly in 2016 compared to its use of cash in operations in 2015. Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2016 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.\nProvision (benefit) for taxes\nA net benefit of $0.4 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting in an effective tax rate of 6.4% for the year. Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.7 million and 20.6%, respectively for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 and 2014 relates primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.\nCUI Global invested $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million in other intangible assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel. The increase to investments in 2016 was due to an increase in product certifications and an ongoing ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK. The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2017.\nRecap of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income (expense)\nDuring 2015, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI-Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company. Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects. Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees. Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment. The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada. Accrued expenses increased $1.8 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation. Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.", "item_7_tables": "Table 155:

$7.3 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $6.0 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A expenses and tax expense.\n\nRevenue \n- Total revenue was $86.5 million in 2016 compared to $86.2 million in 2015. Revenue was flat overall but would have been higher if not for lower translated revenue from Orbital UK due to falling currency rates after Brexit.\n\nExpenses\n- SG&A expenses increased by $1.2 million in 2016 largely due to severance costs and higher audit/accounting fees. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 40% in 2016 compared to 38% in 2015. \n- Depreciation and amortization decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash used in operations decreased from $6.4 million in 2015 to $0.8 million in 2016 due to lower working capital requirements after integrating recent acquisitions.\n- The Company invested $0.9 million in intangible assets in 2016 largely for product certifications and ERP software implementation.\n\nKey developments\n- Opened Orbital Gas Systems North America in 2015 which increased expenses but is progressing towards self-sustainability.\n- Acquired Tectrol assets in 2015 which is integrated into the Power and Electromechanical segment.\n- The Company continues to invest in technology development including GasPT, VE-Probe, Novum, and ICE Block.\n\nThe report discusses the Company's financial performance in 2016 compared to prior years and developments in its business segments. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
