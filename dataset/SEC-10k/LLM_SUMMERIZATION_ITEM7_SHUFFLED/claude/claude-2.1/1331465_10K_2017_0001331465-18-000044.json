Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $146.6 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 5.69 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.8 billion, or 37.0 percent, increase in other investments, and a $3.4 billion, or 3.39 percent, increase in advances.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total liabilities were $139.3 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 5.75 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $7.7 billion, or 5.94 percent, increase in consolidated obligations as a result of the increased funding and liquidity needs during the year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total capital was $7.3 billion, an increase of $316 million, or 4.55 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the Bank's retained earnings and subclass B2 activity-based capital stock resulting from an increase in the total outstanding advances during the year.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank recorded net income of $349 million for 2017, an increase of $71 million, or 25.3 percent, from net income of $278 million for 2016. This increase in net income was primarily due to increased interest rates during the year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017, and December 2017.\nNet interest income was $157 million for 2017, a decrease of $177 million, from net interest income of $334 million for 2016. This decrease was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income related to the prepayment of previous restructured and redesignated advances was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income.\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 4.97 percent for 2017, compared to 4.08 percent for 2016. This increase in ROE was primarily due to an increase in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR increased to 371 basis points for 2017, compared to 334 basis points for 2016. This increase in the ROE spread to LIBOR was primarily due to the increase in ROE.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points and 21 basis points for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments on previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which decreased net interest income.\nBusiness Outlook\nDuring 2017, the Bank continued to maintain its focus on an advances-driven and lower-risk business model, which enabled the Bank to report net income, pay dividends, and repurchase excess stock consistently throughout the year. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions. Compared to FHLB System peers, the Bank has a lower risk balance sheet structure with more funds allocated to lower yielding advances than higher yielding investment securities and mortgage loans.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy has experienced strong growth over the last three quarters of 2017, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect - either positive or negative - on the Bank's financial performance.\nThe gradually rising but relatively low interest rate environment has resulted in borrowers strongly favoring short-term advances. Although the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2016 and 2017, and indicated its intention to raise rates further in 2018, the Bank expects this short-term advance preference to continue during 2018. This higher proportion of short-term advances will continue to subject the Bank to advance rollover risk. In addition, members continue to experience high levels of liquidity, which may continue to reduce overall member demand for advances. Although a higher interest rate environment is more favorable for the Bank's total profitability, it may have a negative impact on ROE spread to LIBOR.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, changes in money market fund investment regulations during 2016 have caused the Bank to experience increased demand from the mutual fund industry for short-term GSE debt, which the Bank expects to continue in 2018. Earnings on the Bank's investment portfolio will continue to be affected by tighter interest rate spreads on new investments as older investments with wider spreads prepay or mature. There is uncertainty, in light of recent changes in the U.S. government administration and recent executive actions, about regulatory changes that could occur in the financial services industry, and what impact those changes could have on the Bank and/or its members.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions).

Development and Growth Enhancement Program\nAdvances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 increased by 3.39 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2017 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 57.9\npercent and 64.2 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed-rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates on them, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which are based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 42.1 percent and 44.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 0.27 percent and 0.68 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances were swapped. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, or constant maturity swap rates.\nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 69.9 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2017 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's advances is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (Unaudited).\nInvestments\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State or local housing agency debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98.31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government-sponsored enterprises debt obligations\n</td> <td>5,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(896\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> U.S. agency obligations-guaranteed residential\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Government-sponsored enterprises residential\n</td> <td>9,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,395\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Government-sponsored enterprises commercial\n</td> <td>9,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Private-label residential\n</td> <td>1,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(463\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>20,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment securities\n</td> <td>26,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing deposits (1)\n</td> <td>2,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities purchased under agreements to resell\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds sold\n</td> <td>9,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other investments\n</td> <td>14,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest-bearing deposits include a $401 million and $1.1 billion, business money market account with Branch Banking and Trust Company, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a $46 million business money market account with United Bank one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total investments was primarily due to an increase in total other investments from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The amount held in other investments will vary each day based on the Bank's liquidity requirements as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The Bank ceased purchasing private-label MBS in 2008.\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would purchase the securities. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, as these investments amounted to 290 percent and 288 percent of regulatory capital, respectively.\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Bank evaluates its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nThe Bank had previously ceased purchasing new mortgage loans in 2008. However, in December 2016, the Bank agreed to purchase a 90 percent participating interest in a $100 million master commitment of certain newly acquired MPP loans from the FHLBank Indianapolis. Principal amounts settled totaled $18 million and $72 million in January 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year, partially offset by new mortgage loans acquired through the participation in the master commitment with the FHLBank Indianapolis.\nPrior to 2008, members that were selling mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore the Bank's conventional mortgage loan portfolio is concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida\n</td> <td>23.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Carolina\n</td> <td>20.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Georgia\n</td> <td>10.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia\n</td> <td>10.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North Carolina\n</td> <td>8.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>26.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nConsolidated Obligations\nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The increase in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was a result of increased funding and liquidity needs during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $146.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 93.7 percent as of December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 80.8 percent and 78.1 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 4.78 percent and 38.9 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nDeposits\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nCapital\nThe FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes. These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank's compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 11, 2017, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2017 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nAll of the FHLBanks entered into a Capital Agreement, which is intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank. Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 31, 2017, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 16, 2017.\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) additional retained earnings equal to two quarters of dividends, based on the current dividend rate and current stock balance. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an\nattractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders relative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about the Bank's dividends declared during 2017 and 2016 is contained in Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nResults of Operations\nDuring 2017, two significant hurricanes impacted the southeastern coasts of the United States. On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas and caused substantial damage and flooding to southeastern Texas, including the Houston metropolitan area. On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall on the Florida mainland near Marco Island, Florida. Hurricane Irma then moved northward through Florida and into Georgia, causing significant damage to property in Florida, Georgia, and certain other southeastern states.\nThe Bank has analyzed the potential impact that damage related to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey might have on the Bank's advances, letters of credit, mortgage loans held for portfolio, and non-agency MBS. Based on its assessment, the Bank does not expect losses related to the hurricanes, if any, to have a material impact to the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents the Bank's significant income items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assessments\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nThe primary source of the Bank's earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $536 million, $442 million, and $616 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates three times during 2017. This increase in interest rates positively impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation interest expense.\nThe increase in net interest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to decreased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2016, compared to 2015. These prepayments resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization during 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced net interest income for those years. These decreases in net interest income were offset by corresponding increases in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December 2015. This increase in interest rates impacted consolidated obligation interest expense more than the offsetting increase in advance interest income.\nThe following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (in millions): Table 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Advances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investments\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest income\n</td> <td>1,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consolidated obligations\n</td> <td>1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. For example, as discussed above, if the derivatives qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is included in net interest income and in the calculation of interest-rate spread. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points, 21 basis points, and 17 basis points for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread from 2016 to 2017, and the increase in interest-rate spread from 2015 to 2016, was primarily due to the increased accelerated amortization related to prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 and 2015 as previously discussed, compared to the lower accelerated amortization during 2016.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td>

The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates during 2017. Additionally, the decreased losses on trading securities were primarily due to a smaller trading securities portfolio size in 2017, compared to 2016.\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to restructured and redesignated advances that were prepaid prior to their maturity during 2016 and 2015, which resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization, respectively.

and 2015. During 2016, Other\u201d includes $2 million of voluntary contributions to AHP in excess of regulatory requirements.\nThe change in assessments each period was due to a change in income before assessments. If income before assessments increases (decreases), then assessments increases (decreases).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is necessary to satisfy members' borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank complies with operational liquidity and contingent liquidity, as well as other regulatory requirements. The Bank also performs a separate and independent measure of liquidity, a 45-day liquidity measurement, to validate the level of liquidity reserves.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to maintain operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) and contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for five business days if it is unable to access the capital markets. The Bank met these regulatory liquidity requirements throughout 2017. The Finance Agency has also provided liquidity guidance to the FHLBanks generally to provide ranges of days for which each FHLBank should maintain positive cash balances based upon different assumptions and scenarios. The Bank has operated within these ranges since the Finance Agency issued this guidance.\nThe Bank has established an internal liquidity measurement separate from the Finance Agency requirements described above. The Bank performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that liquidity reserves are sufficient to service debt obligations for at least 45 days. This analysis assumes no access to debt market issuance and other management assumptions, which are completely independent of the operational and contingent liquidity calculation measured above. The Bank met its 45 day internal liquidity goal throughout 2017.\nThe Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2017. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds during 2017. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance, as well as systemic Federal Reserve wire transfer system disruptions. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Bank's outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2017, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the FHLBanks had $1.03 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $137.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate\nadditional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms of longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis.\nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017.\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After one year\nthrough three years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After three years\nthrough five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated obligations bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and post-retirement contributions\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to the respective footnotes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the contractual obligations and commitments listed in the above table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Bank's financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect the Bank's reported results and disclosures. Several of the Bank's accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank's results. The Bank has identified the following policies that, given the assumptions and judgment used, are critical to an understanding of the Bank's financial condition and results of operations:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair Value Measurements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other-than-temporary Impairment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allowance for Credit Losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Derivatives and Hedging Activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale, and all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price.\nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods as has been the case during the current market environment. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nValuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of the Bank's management with respect to:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market indices (primarily LIBOR and the Overnight Index Swap curve);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prepayments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market volatility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other factors, including default and loss rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment\nThe Bank evaluates its individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities that are in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The Bank recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss when the Bank determines that it will not recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. Securities in the Bank's private-label MBS portfolio that are in an unrealized loss position are evaluated by estimating the projected cash flows using a model that incorporates projections and assumptions based on the structure of the security and certain economic environment assumptions, such as delinquency and default rates, loss severity, home price appreciation, interest rates, and securities prepayment speeds, while factoring in the underlying collateral and credit enhancement.\nIf the present value of the expected cash flows of a particular security is less than the security's amortized cost basis, the security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into the following two components: (1) the amount of the total impairment related to credit loss; and (2) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss that is attributable to the credit loss (that is, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) is recognized in Noninterest income (loss).\u201d The credit loss on a debt security is limited to the amount of that security's unrealized loss. If the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, the portion of the impairment loss that is not attributable to the credit loss is recognized through other comprehensive income.\nIf the Bank determines that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Bank accounts for the investment security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment loss at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis, less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income. For debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the security.\nIn periods subsequent to an other-than-temporary impairment, if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is greater than the amortized cost by a significant amount, an adjustment is made to the security's yield on a prospective basis. Therefore, the Bank recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows through interest income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Bank is required to assess potential credit losses and establish an allowance for credit losses, if required, for each identified portfolio segment of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is the level at which the Bank develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The Bank has established a reserve methodology for each of the following portfolio segments of financing receivables: advances and standby letters of credit, conventional residential mortgage loans, government-guaranteed or -insured residential mortgage loans, term federal funds sold, and term securities purchased under agreements to resell.\nThe Bank considers the application of these standards to its advances, standby letters of credit, mortgage loans, federal fund portfolio, and securities purchased under agreements to resell a critical accounting policy because determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for credit losses requires the Bank to make a number of assumptions. The Bank's assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAdvances and Standby Letters of Credit\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to obtain eligible collateral from borrowers to protect against potential credit losses. Eligible collateral is defined by statute and regulation. The Bank monitors the financial condition of borrowers and regularly verifies the existence and characteristics of a risk-based sample of mortgage collateral pledged to secure advances. Each borrower's collateral requirements and the scope and frequency of its collateral verification reviews are dependent upon certain risk factors. Since its establishment in 1932, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance or standby letter of credit. Based on the collateral held as security, the Bank's collateral policies, credit analysis, and the repayment history on advances, the Bank did not anticipate any credit losses on advances or standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accordingly, the Bank has not recorded any allowance for credit losses on advances, nor has the Bank recorded any liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for further discussion regarding the Bank's credit risk policies and practice.\nConventional Residential Mortgage Loans\nModified loans that are considered a troubled debt restructuring are evaluated individually for impairment when determining the related allowance for credit losses. This credit loss is measured by factoring in expected cash shortfalls (i.e., loss severity rate) incurred as of the reporting date, as well as the economic loss attributable to delaying the original contractual principal and interest due dates.\nAll other conventional residential mortgage loans are evaluated collectively for impairment. The allowance for these loans is determined by an analysis (performed at least quarterly) that includes segregating the portfolio into various aging groups. For loans that are 60 days or less past due, the Bank calculates a loss severity, default rate, and the expected loss based on individual loan characteristics. For loans that are more than 60 days past due, the allowance is determined using an automated valuation model.\nGovernment-Guaranteed or -Insured Residential Mortgage Loans\nThe Bank also invests in government-guaranteed or -insured fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties. Government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans are mortgage loans guaranteed or insured by the VA or the FHA. Any losses from such loans are expected to be recovered from those entities. Any losses from such loans that are not recovered from those entities are absorbed by the servicers. Therefore, the Bank does not record an allowance for credit losses on government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans.\nTerm Federal Funds Sold\nTerm federal funds sold are generally short-term, their recorded balance approximates fair value, and they are transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. If the Bank's investment in federal funds sold is not paid when due, it is evaluated for purposes of an allowance for credit losses. All investments in federal funds sold are unsecured and were repaid or expected to be repaid according to the contracted terms as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for federal funds sold as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTerm Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decrease below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Allowance for Credit Losses to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for a further discussion of management's estimate of credit losses.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nGeneral\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macro hedging of balance sheet risks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank documents the following concurrently with the execution of each hedging relationship:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the hedging strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>determination of the appropriate accounting designation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the method for recording ineffectiveness for hedging relationships.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations\nof both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. The Bank reports all ineffectiveness for qualifying hedges and non-qualifying hedges in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income within Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 3-Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting guidance.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and recent changes in the U.S. government administration. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes. Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below.\nFHLBank Capital Requirements. On July 3, 2017, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule to adopt, with amendments, the regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Board (predecessor to the Finance Agency) pertaining to the capital requirements for the FHLBanks. The proposed rule would carry over most of the existing regulations without material change but would substantively revise the credit risk component of the risk-based capital requirement, as well as the limitations on extensions of unsecured credit. The main revisions would remove the requirement that the FHLBanks calculate credit risk capital charges and unsecured credit limits based on ratings issued by a NRSRO, and instead, require that the FHLBanks establish and use their own internal rating methodology. With respect to derivatives, the proposed rule would impose a new capital charge for cleared derivatives, which under the existing rule do not carry a capital charge, to align with the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing mandate. The proposed rule also would revise the percentages used in the regulation's tables to calculate credit risk capital charges for advances and non-mortgage assets. The Finance Agency proposes to retain, for now, the percentages used in the tables to calculate capital charges for mortgage-related assets, and to address the methodology for residential mortgage assets at a later date. The Bank submitted a joint comment letter with the other FHLBanks on August 31, 2017. The Bank is continuing to evaluate the proposed rules but does not expect this rule, if adopted in final form, to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the foregoing proposed modifications to the risk-based capital requirements, the Finance Agency also announced that it would issue new minimum regulatory liquidity requirements for the FHLBanks in a separate rulemaking or guidance. To the extent that new regulations or guidance increase the Bank's liquidity requirements in the future, the Bank's business activities and operations could be adversely affected.\nLIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate Developments. In July 2017, the FCA, the regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA confirmed in November 2017 that all 20 panel banks providing submissions for LIBOR determination will continue to support the rate through 2021 and work towards developing an alternative benchmark. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board proposed an alternative rate in June 2017 and in August 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal to begin publishing that rate and two other alternative\nrates beginning in 2018. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate interest rate indices or reference rates. The Bank is not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve Board proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will be on the Bank's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts. On September 12, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB\u201d) published a final rule, effective November 13, 2017, requiring certain global systemically important banking institutions ( GSIBs\u201d) regulated by the FRB to amend their covered qualified financial contracts\u201d ( QFCs\u201d) to prevent a counterparty's immediate termination of, and limit the exercise of default rights under, the QFCs in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the GSIB or an affiliate of the GSIB. QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (known as repos\u201d) and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On September 27, 2017, and on November 29, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) respectively adopted final rules that are both substantively identical to the FRB rule, both effective January 1, 2018, with respect to QFCs entered into with certain FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions.\nAlthough the Bank is not a covered entity under these rules, as a counterparty to covered entities under QFCs, the Bank may be required to amend QFCs entered into with FRB-regulated GSIBs or applicable FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions. These rules may impact our ability to terminate business relationships with covered entities and could adversely impact the amount the Bank recovers in the event of the bankruptcy or receivership of a covered entity. However, the Bank does not expect these final rules to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation Security Management Advisory Bulletin. On September 28, 2017, the FHFA issued an Advisory Bulletin that supersedes previous guidance on an FHLBank's information security program. The Advisory Bulletin describes three main components of an information security program and provides the expectation that each FHLBank will use a risk-based approach to implement its information security program. The Advisory Bulletin contains expectations related to (i) governance, including guidance related to roles and responsibilities, risk assessments, industry standards, and cyber-insurance; (ii) engineering and architecture, including guidance on network security, software security, and security of endpoints; and (iii) operations, including guidance on continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, baseline configuration, asset life cycle, awareness and training, incident response and recovery, user access management, data classification and protection, oversight of third parties, and threat intelligence sharing.\nThe Bank does not expect this Advisory Bulletin to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d). The TCJA makes a variety of changes to U.S. income tax law. Notably, the TCJA:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduces marginal tax rates for many corporate and individual taxpayers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>limits some housing-related tax deductions by limiting the mortgage interest deductions to the first $750 thousand in principal value of mortgages, limiting the state and local tax deduction to a combined $10 thousand for income, sales, and property taxes, and for alternative minimum taxpayers, eliminating the deduction for home equity loan interest, all of which changes may particularly affect states with higher property values and/or higher state and local taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes tax rules for some classes of FHLBank members by limiting tax deductions for FDIC premiums paid by banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets and amending a variety of tax provisions applicable to insurance companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the TCJA and its effects on our business and results of operation, as well as the effect, if any, that it may have on our members, the U.S. economy, and the U.S. housing market more generally.\nRisk Management\nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance; and (2) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank's strategic and tactical planning:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent on the Bank's balance sheet and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market Risk/Earnings - maintain an adequate ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR, while providing attractive funding for advance products, consistent payment of dividends, reliable access to funding, and maintenance of retained earnings in excess of stressed retained earnings targets within a conservative risk management framework.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring, and verification. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Governance/Compliance/Legal - compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and manage other legal exposures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mission/Business Model - (1) deliver financial services and consistent access to affordable funds that are the size and structure shareholders desire, helping them to manage risk and extend credit in their communities, while achieving the Bank's affordable housing mission goals; and (2) provide value through the consistent payment of dividends and the repurchasing of excess stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operational Risk - (1) manage the key risks associated with operational availability of critical systems, the integrity and security of the Bank's information, and the alignment of technology investment with key business objectives through enterprise-wide risk management practices and governance based on industry standards; (2) deliver an employee value\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nproposition that allows the Bank to build, retain, engage, and develop staff to meet the evolving needs of the Bank's key stakeholders and effectively manage enterprise-wide risks; and (3) manage the key risks associated with cyber security threats.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reputation - recognize the importance of and promote positive awareness and perception of the Bank and its mission among key external stakeholders impacting the Bank's ability to achieve its mission.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and constantly being presented. Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks. The Bank's board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\nMarket Risk\nGeneral\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank's assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps; and convexity characteristics under assumed changes in interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and market basis relationships. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nUse of Derivatives\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank's derivative position includes interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, investments, and mortgage loans by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate, usually based on LIBOR. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments (in millions). The category Fair value hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which hedge accounting is achieved. The category Non-qualifying hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which the derivatives are not in designated hedging relationships that formally meet the hedge accounting requirements under GAAP.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration and convexity of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of +5 years to -5 years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of +7 years to -7 years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nThe following table presents the Bank's effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years).\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>2.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective duration gap\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.01\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by limiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nThe following table presents the Bank's market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions).

Convexity represents the majority of the change in price not explained by effective duration.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of its members and borrowers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources.\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nCredit Risk\nThe Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets.\nAdvances\nSecured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank's credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral.\nThe Bank utilizes a credit risk rating system for its members, which focuses primarily on an institution's overall financial health and takes into account the quality of assets, earnings, and capital position. The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). In general, borrowers in category 10 may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of the borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. The Bank assigns each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company, such as housing associates, CDFIs, and corporate credit unions, a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each matrix has risk levels that generally correspond to the one to 10 credit risk\nrating for insured depository institutions and insurance companies. Development of these risk matrices for borrowers that are not insured depository institutions or insurance companies enables the Bank to monitor and analyze the financial condition of these borrowers in a more consistent and complete manner. The par value of advances to these institutions totaled $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions).\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nBorrowers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nAdvances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nBorrowers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nAdvances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more than 30 percent. However, the Bank's board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was $27.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. For more information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances refer to Note 9-Advances to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Par Value of Outstanding Advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LCV of Collateral Pledged by Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Mortgage Collateral (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Securities Collateral (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Real Estate Related Collateral (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.61\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>98,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.94\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to\nprovide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\nIn its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInvestments\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. The Finance Agency defines investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing, so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected, and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security.\nIn addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties.\nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>non-U.S. dollar denominated securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank's counterparties. These\nreports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Federal Funds Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest-bearing\nDeposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Derivative Exposure (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Austria\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Germany\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norway\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sweden\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switzerland\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States of America\n</td> <td>1,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) Amounts do not reflect collateral;

see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\nThe Bank experienced an increase in unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties from $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. The following four counterparties each represented greater than 10 percent and collectively represented 53.2 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties: Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of Nova Scotia, Cooperatieve Rabobank UA, and Wells Fargo Bank. As of December 31, 2017, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which are typically rated AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit enhancements, which primarily consisted of the subordination of the claims of the other tranches of these securities. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance,\nmarketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of the Bank's investments held as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions), based on their credit rating as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit ratings as reported by an NRSRO.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNon-Private-label MBS\nThe unrealized losses related to U.S. agency and GSE MBS are caused by interest rate changes. Because these securities are guaranteed by government agencies or GSEs, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2017 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Bank does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nPrivate-label MBS\nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions).

This more stressful scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast, which was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that were 33.0 percent lower than the base case. The base case and adverse case housing price scenarios for credit losses on all other-than temporary impaired private-label MBS were not material for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe adverse case housing price scenario and associated results do not represent the Bank's current expectations and therefore, should not be construed as a prediction of the Bank's future results, market conditions, or the actual performance of these securities. Rather, the results from this hypothetical adverse case housing price scenario provide a measure of the credit losses that the Bank might incur if home price declines (and subsequent recoveries) are more adverse than those projected in the Bank's base case assessment.\nThe Bank continues to actively monitor the credit quality of its private-label MBS investments. It is not possible to predict the magnitude of additional other-than-temporary impairment losses in future periods because that prediction depends on the actual performance of the underlying loan collateral, as well as the Bank's future modeling assumptions. Many factors could influence the Bank's future modeling assumptions, including economic, financial market, and housing market conditions. If performance of the underlying loan collateral deteriorates and/or the Bank's modeling assumptions become more pessimistic, the Bank could experience further losses on its investment portfolio.\nDerivatives\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\nFor uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, the Bank would have been required to deliver up to an additional $9 million of collateral (at fair value) to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2017.\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank currently has the following two approved Clearinghouses: CME Group, Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Limited. Effective January 3, 2017, CME Clearing made certain amendments to its rulebook changing the legal characterization of variation margin payments to be daily settled payments, rather than collateral. Variation margin on daily settled contracts is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. The Bank continues to characterize variation margin payments with LCH.Clearnet LLC as cash\ncollateral. At both Clearinghouses, initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilateral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nMortgage Loan Programs\nThe Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs. In some cases, a portion of the credit support for MPP and MPF loans is provided under a primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance policy. Currently, 10 mortgage insurance companies provide primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance for mortgage loans in which the Bank has a retained interest. As of December 31, 2017, seven of the Bank's 10 mortgage insurance providers have been rated below AA\u201d by one or more NRSROs for their claims paying ability or insurer financial strength, and three are no longer rated. Ratings downgrades imply an increased risk that these mortgage insurers may be unable to fulfill their obligations to pay claims that may be made under the insurance policies. The Bank holds additional risk-based capital to mitigate the incremental risk, if any, that results from the supplemental mortgage insurance providers.\nMPF Program\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards established and maintained by FHLBank Chicago. In some circumstances, the Bank, with the concurrence of FHLBank Chicago, may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with these standards. The Bank has granted a limited number of such waivers related to documentation requirements or accepted alternate underwriting criteria in circumstances in which such waivers would not materially affect the value of the asset.\nThe Bank manages MPF Program credit risk through underwriting and eligibility guidelines and sharing of potential losses with the PFIs. The Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on MPF loans by structuring potential losses on conventional MPF loans into layers with respect to each master commitment. The general allocation of losses under the MPF Program is divided into the following loss layers:\nBorrower's Equity. The first layer of protection against loss is the borrower's equity in the real property securing the MPF loan.\nPrimary Mortgage Insurance. The second layer of protection comes from primary mortgage insurance (PMI) that is required for any MPF loan with a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent at the time of origination.\nFirst Loss Account. Third, losses for each master commitment that are not paid by PMI, up to an agreed-upon amount, are incurred by the Bank up to a pre-specified amount that is tracked in what is called a First Loss Account,\u201d or FLA\u201d. The FLA represents the amount of expected losses that the Bank incurs before the PFI's credit enhancement becomes available to cover losses. For MPF products with performance based credit enhancement fees (e.g., MPF Plus), the Bank may withhold credit enhancement fees to recover losses at the FLA level, essentially transferring a portion of the first layer risk of credit loss to the PFI.\nMember Credit Enhancement. Fourth, for loans purchased under each master commitment, losses in excess of the FLA, up to an agreed-upon amount, called the credit enhancement or CE Amount,\u201d are incurred by the PFI. For MPF Plus, this CE Amount includes supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI). The member's CE Amount is sized using the MPF Program methodology to limit the amount of the Bank's losses in excess of, or including, the FLA (depending on the MPF product) to those that would be expected to be experienced by an investor in an MBS that is rated AA under the S&P LEVELS ratings methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency). Pursuant to the Finance Agency's amended regulation on acquired member assets (AMA), effective January 18, 2017, the MPF Program methodology was adjusted to set the PFI's CE Amount consistent with the Bank's determination, with respect to an asset or pool, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. The CE Amount and the FLA for certain conventional MPF products held in the Bank's portfolio is determined at inception of each loan pool master commitment and may be periodically reset lower for each master commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain the Bank's risk of credit losses within its risk tolerance is usually reduced over time. In one MPF product, the PFI is required to obtain and pay for SMI, for which the Bank is the insured party. The Bank pays the PFI a monthly credit enhancement fee for managing credit risk on the MPF Program loans. In most cases, the credit enhancement fees are performance based, which further motivates the PFI to minimize loan losses on MPF Program loans.\nMPF Bank. Fifth, the Bank absorbs any remaining unallocated losses.\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPF Program mortgage loans was $312 million and $399 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on MPF loans was $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nMPP\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines. In some circumstances, the Bank may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with specified provisions of the MPP guidelines.\nThe Bank manages MPP credit risk by sharing potential losses with the PFI. The general allocation of losses under the MPP is divided into the following loss layers:\nBorrower's Equity and Primary Mortgage Insurance. The first layer of protection against loss is the borrower's equity in the real property securing the MPP loan and PMI where applicable.\nLender Risk Account. Second, the Bank establishes a Lender Risk Account (LRA) for each master commitment to cover losses that are not paid by PMI or borrower's equity. The Bank can establish the amount of the LRA balance either up front as a portion of the purchase proceeds (Fixed LRA) or as a portion of the monthly interest paid by the borrower (Spread LRA).\nThe PFI's recourse is limited to this predetermined LRA amount so that the PFI has no further obligation to make additional contributions to the LRA, regardless of any losses or deterioration of the mortgage pool exceeding such amount in the LRA. Once the LRA has reached the required amount, but not before five years for the Fixed LRA, the Bank will pay the PFI any unused amounts of the LRA that are no longer required to cover expected losses on an annual basis in accordance with a step-down schedule that is established at the time of a master commitment.\nSupplemental Mortgage Insurance. Third, losses for each master commitment in excess of the LRA, up to a specified LTV ratio, are covered by SMI obtained by the PFI. In the MPP, SMI generally covers mortgages with an LTV ratio of 45 percent or greater. In addition, SMI policies for master commitments in excess of $35 million contain an aggregate loss limit whereby the total amount payable by the SMI insurer under the policy is less than the total unpaid principal balances of the insured loans. MPP master commitments entered into in 2017 do not have SMI policies.\nThe Bank has established formal policies and procedures to monitor its exposure to mortgage insurance companies, including a cap on the aggregate amount of permissible exposure to SMI at each provider.\nThe Bank. Fourth, the Bank absorbs any remaining unallocated losses.\nTotal credit enhancement is sized to provide the equivalent of at least a BBB rating under the S&P LEVELS rating methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency).\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPP mortgage loans was $124 million and $126 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on MPP loans was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Operational risk for the Bank also includes reputation and legal risks associated with business practices or market conduct that the Bank may undertake. Operational risk inherently is greatest where transaction processes include numerous processing steps, require greater subjectivity, or are non-routine. The Bank operates in a complex business environment and is subject to numerous regulatory requirements.\nThe Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank's business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments related to operational risk and overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk.\nThe efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) and networks are a necessary component of Bank operations. The information systems architecture of the Bank is client/server-based to support the multiple operating systems and servers, which are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed applications. The Bank's IT division maintains and regularly reviews a number of controls to ensure that the IT assets of the Bank are well managed and secure from unauthorized access. Exposure from the internet (and accompanying network security issues, including software virus risk) is a factor that shapes the Bank's risk profile. This exposure results from the Bank's e-commerce activity and an increasing number of specialized vendor-provided solutions that are supported by web-based servers. Management monitors and maintains controls against attempted spyware and anti-virus attacks against Bank systems. The Bank utilizes firewalls to protect the network from internet based attacks while also employing firewalls on laptops that may operate outside of the Bank's network. Additionally, the Bank has systems to detect an intrusion in the event that it is not stopped by one of the firewalls. The Bank also has an information security department that is responsible for the policies, procedures, reviews, education, and management of entitlement requests. One key objective of the information security department is to protect the Bank's sensitive business information from unauthorized access. A security governance committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program, physical security program, security policies and procedures, and security exceptions and violations. The security governance committee reviews all information security-related incidents and escalates them to the executive management committee or the board, as appropriate.\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\nBusiness Risk\nBusiness risk is the risk of an adverse effect on the Bank's profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and the long-term. Business risk includes political, strategic, reputation, and regulatory events that are beyond the Bank's control. In particular, during 2017 and continuing into 2018, the Bank faces the following business risks:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>competition for advances from traditional and nontraditional sources; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legislative and regulatory changes that could affect the Bank's cost of doing business or alter the Bank's business model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>mortgage loan prepayment rates decrease and result in lower levels of mortgage loan refinance activity, which may result in the reduction of Bank advances to members as increased rates tend to slow home sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConversely, lower rates of inflation or deflation have the opposite effects of the above on the Bank and its holdings.", "item_7_truncated": "Market Risk\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Derivatives Fair Value Before Collateral\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Collateral Pledged To (From) Counterparty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Credit Exposure to Counterparties\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-member counterparties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Asset positions with credit exposure:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Double-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cleared derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Liability positions with credit exposure:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cleared derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative positions with non-member counterparties to which the Bank had credit exposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Member institutions (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, total liabilities were $139.3 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 5.75 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $7.7 billion, or 5.94 percent, increase in consolidated obligations as a result of the increased funding and liquidity needs during the year.\nThe following table presents the Bank's significant income items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions).

The Bank generally requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank does not expect this Advisory Bulletin to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\nThe Bank manages MPP credit risk by sharing potential losses with the PFI. The general allocation of losses under the MPP is divided into the following loss layers:\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decrease below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions). \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. The Finance Agency defines investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing, so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected, and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of quarters\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Agency and Office of Finance\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affordable Housing Program assessments\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense and assessments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $536 million, $442 million, and $616 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 99:

Therefore, the Bank recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows through interest income.\nConversely, lower rates of inflation or deflation have the opposite effects of the above on the Bank and its holdings.\nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to maintain operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) and contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for five business days if it is unable to access the capital markets. The Bank met these regulatory liquidity requirements throughout 2017. The Finance Agency has also provided liquidity guidance to the FHLBanks generally to provide ranges of days for which each FHLBank should maintain positive cash balances based upon different assumptions and scenarios. The Bank has operated within these ranges since the Finance Agency issued this guidance.\n (1) Includes amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Advances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investments\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest income\n</td> <td>1,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consolidated obligations\n</td> <td>1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPF Program mortgage loans was $312 million and $399 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, investments, and mortgage loans by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate, usually based on LIBOR. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent. \nDuring 2017, the Bank continued to maintain its focus on an advances-driven and lower-risk business model, which enabled the Bank to report net income, pay dividends, and repurchase excess stock consistently throughout the year. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions. Compared to FHLB System peers, the Bank has a lower risk balance sheet structure with more funds allocated to lower yielding advances than higher yielding investment securities and mortgage loans.\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale, and all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price.\nInvestments\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

In some cases, a portion of the credit support for MPP and MPF loans is provided under a primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance policy. Currently, 10 mortgage insurance companies provide primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance for mortgage loans in which the Bank has a retained interest. As of December 31, 2017, seven of the Bank's 10 mortgage insurance providers have been rated below AA\u201d by one or more NRSROs for their claims paying ability or insurer financial strength, and three are no longer rated. Ratings downgrades imply an increased risk that these mortgage insurers may be unable to fulfill their obligations to pay claims that may be made under the insurance policies. The Bank holds additional risk-based capital to mitigate the incremental risk, if any, that results from the supplemental mortgage insurance providers.\nMandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts. On September 12, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB\u201d) published a final rule, effective November 13, 2017, requiring certain global systemically important banking institutions ( GSIBs\u201d) regulated by the FRB to amend their covered qualified financial contracts\u201d ( QFCs\u201d) to prevent a counterparty's immediate termination of, and limit the exercise of default rights under, the QFCs in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the GSIB or an affiliate of the GSIB. QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (known as repos\u201d) and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On September 27, 2017, and on November 29, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) respectively adopted final rules that are both substantively identical to the FRB rule, both effective January 1, 2018, with respect to QFCs entered into with certain FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hedged Item / Hedging Instrument\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hedging Objective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hedge\nAccounting\nDesignation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Obligation Discount Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Converts the discount note's fixed rate to a variable-rate index.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair value hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Converts the asset or liability fixed rate to a variable-rate index.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-qualifying\nhedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate cap or floor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Protects against changes in income of certain assets due to changes in interest rates.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-qualifying hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediary Positions and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swap, and receive-fixed, pay variable interest rate swap\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>To offset interest rate swaps executed with members by executing interest rate swaps with derivatives counterparties.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-qualifying\nhedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stand-alone derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage delivery commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Exposed to fair-value risk associated with fixed-rate mortgage purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets.\n \u2022 market volatility; and \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nBorrower's Equity.

Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2017, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the FHLBanks had $1.03 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $137.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nBusiness Risk\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and recent changes in the U.S. government administration. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes.

The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). In general, borrowers in category 10 may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of the borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. The Bank assigns each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company, such as housing associates, CDFIs, and corporate credit unions, a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each matrix has risk levels that generally correspond to the one to 10 credit risk\n\nExecutive Summary\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank currently has the following two approved Clearinghouses: CME Group, Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Limited. Effective January 3, 2017, CME Clearing made certain amendments to its rulebook changing the legal characterization of variation margin payments to be daily settled payments, rather than collateral. Variation margin on daily settled contracts is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. The Bank continues to characterize variation margin payments with LCH.Clearnet LLC as cash\nreports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Because these securities are guaranteed by government agencies or GSEs, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2017 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Bank does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of +5 years to -5 years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of +7 years to -7 years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nmarketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.\n____________\nTotal noninterest expense remained relatively stable during 2017, 2016, and 2015. During 2016, Other\u201d includes $2 million of voluntary contributions to AHP in excess of regulatory requirements.\ncollateral. At both Clearinghouses, initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilateral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points and 21 basis points for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments on previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which decreased net interest income.\n \u2022 instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; \nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\n____________\nMPP\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank's assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n \u2022 conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate; \n\nLiquidity is necessary to satisfy members' borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank complies with operational liquidity and contingent liquidity, as well as other regulatory requirements. The Bank also performs a separate and independent measure of liquidity, a 45-day liquidity measurement, to validate the level of liquidity reserves.\nGovernment-Guaranteed or -Insured Residential Mortgage Loans\nPrior to 2008, members that were selling mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore the Bank's conventional mortgage loan portfolio is concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.\nThe Bank supplements its interest rate risk analysis by measuring convexity, or the rate of change of effective duration given changes in interest rates. Convexity represents the majority of the change in price not explained by effective duration.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\nCredit Risk\nMortgage Loan Programs\n \u2022 conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and \nThe following table presents the Bank's advances outstanding by year of maturity and the related weighted-average interest rate (dollars in millions):\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\nInvestments\nIf the present value of the expected cash flows of a particular security is less than the security's amortized cost basis, the security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into the following two components: (1) the amount of the total impairment related to credit loss; and (2) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss that is attributable to the credit loss (that is, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) is recognized in Noninterest income (loss).\u201d The credit loss on a debt security is limited to the amount of that security's unrealized loss. If the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, the portion of the impairment loss that is not attributable to the credit loss is recognized through other comprehensive income.\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nIn its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n____________\nNoninterest Income (Loss)\n \u2022 the hedging strategy; \nDeposits\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\n____________\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nThe efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) and networks are a necessary component of Bank operations. The information systems architecture of the Bank is client/server-based to support the multiple operating systems and servers, which are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed applications. The Bank's IT division maintains and regularly reviews a number of controls to ensure that the IT assets of the Bank are well managed and secure from unauthorized access. Exposure from the internet (and accompanying network security issues, including software virus risk) is a factor that shapes the Bank's risk profile. This exposure results from the Bank's e-commerce activity and an increasing number of specialized vendor-provided solutions that are supported by web-based servers. Management monitors and maintains controls against attempted spyware and anti-virus attacks against Bank systems. The Bank utilizes firewalls to protect the network from internet based attacks while also employing firewalls on laptops that may operate outside of the Bank's network. Additionally, the Bank has systems to detect an intrusion in the event that it is not stopped by one of the firewalls. The Bank also has an information security department that is responsible for the policies, procedures, reviews, education, and management of entitlement requests. One key objective of the information security department is to protect the Bank's sensitive business information from unauthorized access. A security governance committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program, physical security program, security policies and procedures, and security exceptions and violations. The security governance committee reviews all information security-related incidents and escalates them to the executive management committee or the board, as appropriate.\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. For more information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances refer to Note 9-Advances to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nThe Bank. Fourth, the Bank absorbs any remaining unallocated losses.\nIn addition to the cash flow analysis of the Bank's private-label MBS under a base case (best estimate) housing price scenario as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements, a cash flow analysis was also performed based on a housing price scenario that is more adverse than the base case (adverse case housing price scenario). This more stressful scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast, which was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that were 33.0 percent lower than the base case. The base case and adverse case housing price scenarios for credit losses on all other-than temporary impaired private-label MBS were not material for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n___________\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates three times during 2017. This increase in interest rates positively impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation interest expense.\n (3) Nonperforming mortgage loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate. \nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods as has been the case during the current market environment. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments (in millions). The category Fair value hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which hedge accounting is achieved. The category Non-qualifying hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which the derivatives are not in designated hedging relationships that formally meet the hedge accounting requirements under GAAP.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d). The TCJA makes a variety of changes to U.S. income tax law. Notably, the TCJA:\nIf effective duration of equity or market value of equity is approaching the boundaries of the Bank's RMP ranges, management will initiate remedial action or review alternative strategies at the next meeting of the board of directors or appropriate committee thereof.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's advances is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (Unaudited).\nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nUnder the Bank's RMP, the Bank's market value of equity must not decline by more than 15 percent, assuming an immediate, parallel, and sustained interest-rate shock of 200 basis points in either direction.\n\nUse of Derivatives\n____________\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nThe Bank also invests in government-guaranteed or -insured fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties. Government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans are mortgage loans guaranteed or insured by the VA or the FHA. Any losses from such loans are expected to be recovered from those entities. Any losses from such loans that are not recovered from those entities are absorbed by the servicers. Therefore, the Bank does not record an allowance for credit losses on government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans.\n\nModified loans that are considered a troubled debt restructuring are evaluated individually for impairment when determining the related allowance for credit losses. This credit loss is measured by factoring in expected cash shortfalls (i.e., loss severity rate) incurred as of the reporting date, as well as the economic loss attributable to delaying the original contractual principal and interest due dates.\n\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nThe gradually rising but relatively low interest rate environment has resulted in borrowers strongly favoring short-term advances. Although the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2016 and 2017, and indicated its intention to raise rates further in 2018, the Bank expects this short-term advance preference to continue during 2018. This higher proportion of short-term advances will continue to subject the Bank to advance rollover risk. In addition, members continue to experience high levels of liquidity, which may continue to reduce overall member demand for advances. Although a higher interest rate environment is more favorable for the Bank's total profitability, it may have a negative impact on ROE spread to LIBOR.\nLender Risk Account. Second, the Bank establishes a Lender Risk Account (LRA) for each master commitment to cover losses that are not paid by PMI or borrower's equity. The Bank can establish the amount of the LRA balance either up front as a portion of the purchase proceeds (Fixed LRA) or as a portion of the monthly interest paid by the borrower (Spread LRA).\n \u2022 the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and \nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more than 30 percent. However, the Bank's board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was $27.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nTerm Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 80.8 percent and 78.1 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 4.78 percent and 38.9 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped.\nResults of Operations\n____________\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\n \u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses; and \nOther-than-temporary Impairment\nThe Bank recorded net income of $349 million for 2017, an increase of $71 million, or 25.3 percent, from net income of $278 million for 2016. This increase in net income was primarily due to increased interest rates during the year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017, and December 2017.\n\nSupplemental Mortgage Insurance. Third, losses for each master commitment in excess of the LRA, up to a specified LTV ratio, are covered by SMI obtained by the PFI. In the MPP, SMI generally covers mortgages with an LTV ratio of 45 percent or greater. In addition, SMI policies for master commitments in excess of $35 million contain an aggregate loss limit whereby the total amount payable by the SMI insurer under the policy is less than the total unpaid principal balances of the insured loans. MPP master commitments entered into in 2017 do not have SMI policies.\n \u2022 interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs); \nAdvances\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the TCJA and its effects on our business and results of operation, as well as the effect, if any, that it may have on our members, the U.S. economy, and the U.S. housing market more generally.\nThe adverse case housing price scenario and associated results do not represent the Bank's current expectations and therefore, should not be construed as a prediction of the Bank's future results, market conditions, or the actual performance of these securities. Rather, the results from this hypothetical adverse case housing price scenario provide a measure of the credit losses that the Bank might incur if home price declines (and subsequent recoveries) are more adverse than those projected in the Bank's base case assessment.\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nMPF Program\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\n \u2022 the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and \n(1) Collateral held with respect to derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\n \u2022 Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations. \nThe FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes. These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank's compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n(1) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would purchase the securities. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, as these investments amounted to 290 percent and 288 percent of regulatory capital, respectively.\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nThe Bank experienced an increase in unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties from $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. The following four counterparties each represented greater than 10 percent and collectively represented 53.2 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties: Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of Nova Scotia, Cooperatieve Rabobank UA, and Wells Fargo Bank. As of December 31, 2017, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nFair Value Measurements\n\nNet interest income was $157 million for 2017, a decrease of $177 million, from net interest income of $334 million for 2016. This decrease was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income related to the prepayment of previous restructured and redesignated advances was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income.\n \u2022 legislative and regulatory changes that could affect the Bank's cost of doing business or alter the Bank's business model. \n____________\n \u2022 Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent on the Bank's balance sheet and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses. \nattractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders relative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about the Bank's dividends declared during 2017 and 2016 is contained in Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n \u2022 Reputation - recognize the importance of and promote positive awareness and perception of the Bank and its mission among key external stakeholders impacting the Bank's ability to achieve its mission. \n \u2022 Mission/Business Model - (1) deliver financial services and consistent access to affordable funds that are the size and structure shareholders desire, helping them to manage risk and extend credit in their communities, while achieving the Bank's affordable housing mission goals; and (2) provide value through the consistent payment of dividends and the repurchasing of excess stock. \nproposition that allows the Bank to build, retain, engage, and develop staff to meet the evolving needs of the Bank's key stakeholders and effectively manage enterprise-wide risks; and (3) manage the key risks associated with cyber security threats.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \n \u2022 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.  Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 11, 2017, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2017 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nof both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy has experienced strong growth over the last three quarters of 2017, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect - either positive or negative - on the Bank's financial performance.\nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. The Bank reports all ineffectiveness for qualifying hedges and non-qualifying hedges in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income within Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank's derivative position includes interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways:\nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nFinancial Condition\n \u2022 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. \nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of its members and borrowers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources.\nrating for insured depository institutions and insurance companies. Development of these risk matrices for borrowers that are not insured depository institutions or insurance companies enables the Bank to monitor and analyze the financial condition of these borrowers in a more consistent and complete manner. The par value of advances to these institutions totaled $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2017. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds during 2017. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\n (2) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nIf the Bank determines that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Bank accounts for the investment security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment loss at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis, less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income. For debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the security.\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nConventional Residential Mortgage Loans\nLIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate Developments. In July 2017, the FCA, the regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA confirmed in November 2017 that all 20 panel banks providing submissions for LIBOR determination will continue to support the rate through 2021 and work towards developing an alternative benchmark. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board proposed an alternative rate in June 2017 and in August 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal to begin publishing that rate and two other alternative\nNet Income\n \u2022 determination of the appropriate accounting designation; \nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 limits some housing-related tax deductions by limiting the mortgage interest deductions to the first $750 thousand in principal value of mortgages, limiting the state and local tax deduction to a combined $10 thousand for income, sales, and property taxes, and for alternative minimum taxpayers, eliminating the deduction for home equity loan interest, all of which changes may particularly affect states with higher property values and/or higher state and local taxes; and \n____________\nFHLBank Capital Requirements. On July 3, 2017, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule to adopt, with amendments, the regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Board (predecessor to the Finance Agency) pertaining to the capital requirements for the FHLBanks. The proposed rule would carry over most of the existing regulations without material change but would substantively revise the credit risk component of the risk-based capital requirement, as well as the limitations on extensions of unsecured credit. The main revisions would remove the requirement that the FHLBanks calculate credit risk capital charges and unsecured credit limits based on ratings issued by a NRSRO, and instead, require that the FHLBanks establish and use their own internal rating methodology. With respect to derivatives, the proposed rule would impose a new capital charge for cleared derivatives, which under the existing rule do not carry a capital charge, to align with the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing mandate. The proposed rule also would revise the percentages used in the regulation's tables to calculate credit risk capital charges for advances and non-mortgage assets. The Finance Agency proposes to retain, for now, the percentages used in the tables to calculate capital charges for mortgage-related assets, and to address the methodology for residential mortgage assets at a later date. The Bank submitted a joint comment letter with the other FHLBanks on August 31, 2017. The Bank is continuing to evaluate the proposed rules but does not expect this rule, if adopted in final form, to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\n\n \u2022 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. \nIn addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties.\nprovide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank.\n \u2022 instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; \nThe Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank's business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments related to operational risk and overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk.\nAdvances\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $146.6 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 5.69 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.8 billion, or 37.0 percent, increase in other investments, and a $3.4 billion, or 3.39 percent, increase in advances.\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Allowance for Credit Losses to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for a further discussion of management's estimate of credit losses.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements.\nThe board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and constantly being presented. Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nThe primary source of the Bank's earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\n \u2022 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; \nAdvances and Standby Letters of Credit\n \u2022 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; \nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nDuring 2017, two significant hurricanes impacted the southeastern coasts of the United States. On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas and caused substantial damage and flooding to southeastern Texas, including the Houston metropolitan area. On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall on the Florida mainland near Marco Island, Florida. Hurricane Irma then moved northward through Florida and into Georgia, causing significant damage to property in Florida, Georgia, and certain other southeastern states.\n____________\nBorrower's Equity and Primary Mortgage Insurance. The first layer of protection against loss is the borrower's equity in the real property securing the MPP loan and PMI where applicable.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and do not include related accrued interest receivable of $36 million as of December 31, 2017. \nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\n(4) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract.\nrates beginning in 2018. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate interest rate indices or reference rates. The Bank is not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve Board proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will be on the Bank's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n \u2022 Governance/Compliance/Legal - compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and manage other legal exposures. \n \u2022 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and \nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Bank manages MPF Program credit risk through underwriting and eligibility guidelines and sharing of potential losses with the PFIs. The Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on MPF loans by structuring potential losses on conventional MPF loans into layers with respect to each master commitment. The general allocation of losses under the MPF Program is divided into the following loss layers:\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions). \n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and do not include related accrued interest receivable of $35 million as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Market Risk/Earnings - maintain an adequate ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR, while providing attractive funding for advance products, consistent payment of dividends, reliable access to funding, and maintenance of retained earnings in excess of stressed retained earnings targets within a conservative risk management framework. \nThe Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration and convexity of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points, 21 basis points, and 17 basis points for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread from 2016 to 2017, and the increase in interest-rate spread from 2015 to 2016, was primarily due to the increased accelerated amortization related to prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 and 2015 as previously discussed, compared to the lower accelerated amortization during 2016.\n \u2022 Fair Value Measurements; \nThe increase in total investments was primarily due to an increase in total other investments from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The amount held in other investments will vary each day based on the Bank's liquidity requirements as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The Bank ceased purchasing private-label MBS in 2008.\n \u2022 macro hedging of balance sheet risks. \n(1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\nThe increase in net interest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to decreased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2016, compared to 2015. These prepayments resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization during 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced net interest income for those years. These decreases in net interest income were offset by corresponding increases in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December 2015. This increase in interest rates impacted consolidated obligation interest expense more than the offsetting increase in advance interest income.\n\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance; and (2) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations.\n\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate\n\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to obtain eligible collateral from borrowers to protect against potential credit losses. Eligible collateral is defined by statute and regulation. The Bank monitors the financial condition of borrowers and regularly verifies the existence and characteristics of a risk-based sample of mortgage collateral pledged to secure advances. Each borrower's collateral requirements and the scope and frequency of its collateral verification reviews are dependent upon certain risk factors. Since its establishment in 1932, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance or standby letter of credit. Based on the collateral held as security, the Bank's collateral policies, credit analysis, and the repayment history on advances, the Bank did not anticipate any credit losses on advances or standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accordingly, the Bank has not recorded any allowance for credit losses on advances, nor has the Bank recorded any liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for further discussion regarding the Bank's credit risk policies and practice.\nAdvances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 increased by 3.39 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2017 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 57.9\n\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 4.97 percent for 2017, compared to 4.08 percent for 2016. This increase in ROE was primarily due to an increase in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR increased to 371 basis points for 2017, compared to 334 basis points for 2016. This increase in the ROE spread to LIBOR was primarily due to the increase in ROE.\nThe Bank had previously ceased purchasing new mortgage loans in 2008. However, in December 2016, the Bank agreed to purchase a 90 percent participating interest in a $100 million master commitment of certain newly acquired MPP loans from the FHLBank Indianapolis. Principal amounts settled totaled $18 million and $72 million in January 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year, partially offset by new mortgage loans acquired through the participation in the master commitment with the FHLBank Indianapolis.\n\n \u2022 Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; \nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 69.9 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2017 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nThe following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activity on the Bank's results of operations (in millions):\nThe increase in total noninterest income during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to restructured and redesignated advances that were prepaid prior to their maturity during 2017, which resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during the year. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income during the year and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates during 2017. Additionally, the decreased losses on trading securities were primarily due to a smaller trading securities portfolio size in 2017, compared to 2016.\n (1) Interest-bearing deposits include a $401 million and $1.1 billion, business money market account with Branch Banking and Trust Company, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a $46 million business money market account with United Bank one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017. \nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\n____________\npercent and 64.2 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed-rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates on them, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which are based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 42.1 percent and 44.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 0.27 percent and 0.68 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances were swapped. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, or constant maturity swap rates.\nPrimary Mortgage Insurance. The second layer of protection comes from primary mortgage insurance (PMI) that is required for any MPF loan with a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent at the time of origination.\n____________\nThe Bank evaluates its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n \u2022 competition for advances from traditional and nontraditional sources; and \nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nMember Credit Enhancement. Fourth, for loans purchased under each master commitment, losses in excess of the FLA, up to an agreed-upon amount, called the credit enhancement or CE Amount,\u201d are incurred by the PFI. For MPF Plus, this CE Amount includes supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI). The member's CE Amount is sized using the MPF Program methodology to limit the amount of the Bank's losses in excess of, or including, the FLA (depending on the MPF product) to those that would be expected to be experienced by an investor in an MBS that is rated AA under the S&P LEVELS ratings methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency). Pursuant to the Finance Agency's amended regulation on acquired member assets (AMA), effective January 18, 2017, the MPF Program methodology was adjusted to set the PFI's CE Amount consistent with the Bank's determination, with respect to an asset or pool, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. The CE Amount and the FLA for certain conventional MPF products held in the Bank's portfolio is determined at inception of each loan pool master commitment and may be periodically reset lower for each master commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain the Bank's risk of credit losses within its risk tolerance is usually reduced over time. In one MPF product, the PFI is required to obtain and pay for SMI, for which the Bank is the insured party. The Bank pays the PFI a monthly credit enhancement fee for managing credit risk on the MPF Program loans. In most cases, the credit enhancement fees are performance based, which further motivates the PFI to minimize loan losses on MPF Program loans.\nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017.\nFirst Loss Account. Third, losses for each master commitment that are not paid by PMI, up to an agreed-upon amount, are incurred by the Bank up to a pre-specified amount that is tracked in what is called a First Loss Account,\u201d or FLA\u201d. The FLA represents the amount of expected losses that the Bank incurs before the PFI's credit enhancement becomes available to cover losses. For MPF products with performance based credit enhancement fees (e.g., MPF Plus), the Bank may withhold credit enhancement fees to recover losses at the FLA level, essentially transferring a portion of the first layer risk of credit loss to the PFI.\n (1) Volume change is calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the previous rate, while rate change is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the previous volume. The rate/volume change, calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of its total. \nNoninterest Expense and Assessments\nFor those securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment was determined to have occurred during 2017, a summary of the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings is contained in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n \u2022 the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases; \nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPP mortgage loans was $124 million and $126 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on MPP loans was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough the Bank is not a covered entity under these rules, as a counterparty to covered entities under QFCs, the Bank may be required to amend QFCs entered into with FRB-regulated GSIBs or applicable FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions. These rules may impact our ability to terminate business relationships with covered entities and could adversely impact the amount the Bank recovers in the event of the bankruptcy or receivership of a covered entity. However, the Bank does not expect these final rules to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.\nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. For example, as discussed above, if the derivatives qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is included in net interest income and in the calculation of interest-rate spread. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\n\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nNon-Private-label MBS\n \u2022 changes tax rules for some classes of FHLBank members by limiting tax deductions for FDIC premiums paid by banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets and amending a variety of tax provisions applicable to insurance companies. \n \u2022 other factors, including default and loss rates. \nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 31, 2017, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 16, 2017.\n \u2022 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and \nConsolidated Obligations\nThe Bank has established an internal liquidity measurement separate from the Finance Agency requirements described above. The Bank performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that liquidity reserves are sufficient to service debt obligations for at least 45 days. This analysis assumes no access to debt market issuance and other management assumptions, which are completely independent of the operational and contingent liquidity calculation measured above. The Bank met its 45 day internal liquidity goal throughout 2017.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, changes in money market fund investment regulations during 2016 have caused the Bank to experience increased demand from the mutual fund industry for short-term GSE debt, which the Bank expects to continue in 2018. Earnings on the Bank's investment portfolio will continue to be affected by tighter interest rate spreads on new investments as older investments with wider spreads prepay or mature. There is uncertainty, in light of recent changes in the U.S. government administration and recent executive actions, about regulatory changes that could occur in the financial services industry, and what impact those changes could have on the Bank and/or its members.\nAll other conventional residential mortgage loans are evaluated collectively for impairment. The allowance for these loans is determined by an analysis (performed at least quarterly) that includes segregating the portfolio into various aging groups. For loans that are 60 days or less past due, the Bank calculates a loss severity, default rate, and the expected loss based on individual loan characteristics. For loans that are more than 60 days past due, the allowance is determined using an automated valuation model.\n(1) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\n (1) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \n \u2022 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; \nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The increase in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was a result of increased funding and liquidity needs during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $146.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 93.7 percent as of December 31, 2016.\n____________\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to\n\nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nThe following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used to evaluate each of the Bank's private-label MBS for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2017.\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance, as well as systemic Federal Reserve wire transfer system disruptions. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\n(3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by limiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\nBusiness Outlook\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines. In some circumstances, the Bank may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with specified provisions of the MPP guidelines.\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nThe Bank evaluates its individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities that are in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The Bank recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss when the Bank determines that it will not recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. Securities in the Bank's private-label MBS portfolio that are in an unrealized loss position are evaluated by estimating the projected cash flows using a model that incorporates projections and assumptions based on the structure of the security and certain economic environment assumptions, such as delinquency and default rates, loss severity, home price appreciation, interest rates, and securities prepayment speeds, while factoring in the underlying collateral and credit enhancement.\n(1) Economic Development and Growth Enhancement Program\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\n (1) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\n \u2022 mortgage loan prepayment rates decrease and result in lower levels of mortgage loan refinance activity, which may result in the reduction of Bank advances to members as increased rates tend to slow home sales. \nMortgage loans purchased under the MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards established and maintained by FHLBank Chicago. In some circumstances, the Bank, with the concurrence of FHLBank Chicago, may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with these standards. The Bank has granted a limited number of such waivers related to documentation requirements or accepted alternate underwriting criteria in circumstances in which such waivers would not materially affect the value of the asset.\nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks. The Bank's board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to restructured and redesignated advances that were prepaid prior to their maturity during 2016 and 2015, which resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization, respectively. This accelerated amortization, as previously discussed, reduced net interest income during the years and was offset by corresponding increases in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining\nNet interest income for the years presented was affected by changes in average balances (volume change) and changes in average rates (rate change) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the extent to which volume changes and rate changes affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense (in millions). As presented in the table below, the overall changes in net interest income between 2017 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2015, were primarily rate related.\nThe Bank continues to actively monitor the credit quality of its private-label MBS investments. It is not possible to predict the magnitude of additional other-than-temporary impairment losses in future periods because that prediction depends on the actual performance of the underlying loan collateral, as well as the Bank's future modeling assumptions. Many factors could influence the Bank's future modeling assumptions, including economic, financial market, and housing market conditions. If performance of the underlying loan collateral deteriorates and/or the Bank's modeling assumptions become more pessimistic, the Bank could experience further losses on its investment portfolio.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n (4) Includes amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \n \u2022 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; \nNet Interest Income\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\n____________\nThe following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (in millions): \nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps; and convexity characteristics under assumed changes in interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and market basis relationships. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nGeneral\n \u2022 As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility. \nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which are typically rated AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit enhancements, which primarily consisted of the subordination of the claims of the other tranches of these securities. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance,\nInformation Security Management Advisory Bulletin. On September 28, 2017, the FHFA issued an Advisory Bulletin that supersedes previous guidance on an FHLBank's information security program. The Advisory Bulletin describes three main components of an information security program and provides the expectation that each FHLBank will use a risk-based approach to implement its information security program. The Advisory Bulletin contains expectations related to (i) governance, including guidance related to roles and responsibilities, risk assessments, industry standards, and cyber-insurance; (ii) engineering and architecture, including guidance on network security, software security, and security of endpoints; and (iii) operations, including guidance on continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, baseline configuration, asset life cycle, awareness and training, incident response and recovery, user access management, data classification and protection, oversight of third parties, and threat intelligence sharing.\nIn connection with the foregoing proposed modifications to the risk-based capital requirements, the Finance Agency also announced that it would issue new minimum regulatory liquidity requirements for the FHLBanks in a separate rulemaking or guidance. To the extent that new regulations or guidance increase the Bank's liquidity requirements in the future, the Bank's business activities and operations could be adversely affected.\n____________\nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, the Bank would have been required to deliver up to an additional $9 million of collateral (at fair value) to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank has established formal policies and procedures to monitor its exposure to mortgage insurance companies, including a cap on the aggregate amount of permissible exposure to SMI at each provider.\n(1) The classification of securities is based on current characteristics and performance, which may be different from the securities' classification as determined\nGeneral\nPrivate-label MBS\nAll of the FHLBanks entered into a Capital Agreement, which is intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank. Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) additional retained earnings equal to two quarters of dividends, based on the current dividend rate and current stock balance. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an\nThe Bank is required to assess potential credit losses and establish an allowance for credit losses, if required, for each identified portfolio segment of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is the level at which the Bank develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The Bank has established a reserve methodology for each of the following portfolio segments of financing receivables: advances and standby letters of credit, conventional residential mortgage loans, government-guaranteed or -insured residential mortgage loans, term federal funds sold, and term securities purchased under agreements to resell.\nby the originator at the time of origination.\nEffects of Inflation\n\nCyclicality and Seasonality\n(1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\nInterest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\n\nOperational Risk\n \u2022 the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases; \nThe Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and \n \u2022 Operational Risk - (1) manage the key risks associated with operational availability of critical systems, the integrity and security of the Bank's information, and the alignment of technology investment with key business objectives through enterprise-wide risk management practices and governance based on industry standards; (2) deliver an employee value \n\nFinancial Condition\nThe PFI's recourse is limited to this predetermined LRA amount so that the PFI has no further obligation to make additional contributions to the LRA, regardless of any losses or deterioration of the mortgage pool exceeding such amount in the LRA. Once the LRA has reached the required amount, but not before five years for the Fixed LRA, the Bank will pay the PFI any unused amounts of the LRA that are no longer required to cover expected losses on an annual basis in accordance with a step-down schedule that is established at the time of a master commitment.\n\nRefer to the respective footnotes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the contractual obligations and commitments listed in the above table.\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\nTerm federal funds sold are generally short-term, their recorded balance approximates fair value, and they are transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. If the Bank's investment in federal funds sold is not paid when due, it is evaluated for purposes of an allowance for credit losses. All investments in federal funds sold are unsecured and were repaid or expected to be repaid according to the contracted terms as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for federal funds sold as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u2022 Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring, and verification. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk. \nTotal credit enhancement is sized to provide the equivalent of at least a BBB rating under the S&P LEVELS rating methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency).", "item_7_text": "Market Risk\nAs of December 31, 2017, total liabilities were $139.3 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 5.75 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $7.7 billion, or 5.94 percent, increase in consolidated obligations as a result of the increased funding and liquidity needs during the year.\nThe following table presents the Bank's significant income items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n \u2022 Other-than-temporary Impairment; \n(2) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income.\n \u2022 market indices (primarily LIBOR and the Overnight Index Swap curve); \nFor uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank does not expect this Advisory Bulletin to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\nThe Bank manages MPP credit risk by sharing potential losses with the PFI. The general allocation of losses under the MPP is divided into the following loss layers:\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decrease below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital\n \u2022 discount rates; \nSee Note 3-Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting guidance.\nThe following table presents the Bank's market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions). \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. The Finance Agency defines investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing, so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected, and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $536 million, $442 million, and $616 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDerivatives\nThe preparation of the Bank's financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect the Bank's reported results and disclosures. Several of the Bank's accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank's results. The Bank has identified the following policies that, given the assumptions and judgment used, are critical to an understanding of the Bank's financial condition and results of operations:\nThe Bank's board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank's strategic and tactical planning:\nIn periods subsequent to an other-than-temporary impairment, if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is greater than the amortized cost by a significant amount, an adjustment is made to the security's yield on a prospective basis. Therefore, the Bank recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows through interest income.\nConversely, lower rates of inflation or deflation have the opposite effects of the above on the Bank and its holdings.\nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to maintain operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) and contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for five business days if it is unable to access the capital markets. The Bank met these regulatory liquidity requirements throughout 2017. The Finance Agency has also provided liquidity guidance to the FHLBanks generally to provide ranges of days for which each FHLBank should maintain positive cash balances based upon different assumptions and scenarios. The Bank has operated within these ranges since the Finance Agency issued this guidance.\n (1) Includes amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions).\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPF Program mortgage loans was $312 million and $399 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on MPF loans was $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Operational risk for the Bank also includes reputation and legal risks associated with business practices or market conduct that the Bank may undertake. Operational risk inherently is greatest where transaction processes include numerous processing steps, require greater subjectivity, or are non-routine. The Bank operates in a complex business environment and is subject to numerous regulatory requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total capital was $7.3 billion, an increase of $316 million, or 4.55 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the Bank's retained earnings and subclass B2 activity-based capital stock resulting from an increase in the total outstanding advances during the year.\n\nThe Bank has analyzed the potential impact that damage related to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey might have on the Bank's advances, letters of credit, mortgage loans held for portfolio, and non-agency MBS. Based on its assessment, the Bank does not expect losses related to the hurricanes, if any, to have a material impact to the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.\n \u2022 prepayments; \n____________\nadditional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms of longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis.\nThe following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions).\nThe Bank considers the application of these standards to its advances, standby letters of credit, mortgage loans, federal fund portfolio, and securities purchased under agreements to resell a critical accounting policy because determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for credit losses requires the Bank to make a number of assumptions. The Bank's assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \u2022 identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item; \n \u2022 As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, investments, and mortgage loans by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate, usually based on LIBOR. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent. \nDuring 2017, the Bank continued to maintain its focus on an advances-driven and lower-risk business model, which enabled the Bank to report net income, pay dividends, and repurchase excess stock consistently throughout the year. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions. Compared to FHLB System peers, the Bank has a lower risk balance sheet structure with more funds allocated to lower yielding advances than higher yielding investment securities and mortgage loans.\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale, and all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price.\nInvestments\nSecured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank's credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral.\n \u2022 reduces marginal tax rates for many corporate and individual taxpayers; \nFinance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank's counterparties. These\nThe following table presents the Bank's effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years).\nBusiness risk is the risk of an adverse effect on the Bank's profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and the long-term. Business risk includes political, strategic, reputation, and regulatory events that are beyond the Bank's control. In particular, during 2017 and continuing into 2018, the Bank faces the following business risks:\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\nThe Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs. In some cases, a portion of the credit support for MPP and MPF loans is provided under a primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance policy. Currently, 10 mortgage insurance companies provide primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance for mortgage loans in which the Bank has a retained interest. As of December 31, 2017, seven of the Bank's 10 mortgage insurance providers have been rated below AA\u201d by one or more NRSROs for their claims paying ability or insurer financial strength, and three are no longer rated. Ratings downgrades imply an increased risk that these mortgage insurers may be unable to fulfill their obligations to pay claims that may be made under the insurance policies. The Bank holds additional risk-based capital to mitigate the incremental risk, if any, that results from the supplemental mortgage insurance providers.\nMandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts. On September 12, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB\u201d) published a final rule, effective November 13, 2017, requiring certain global systemically important banking institutions ( GSIBs\u201d) regulated by the FRB to amend their covered qualified financial contracts\u201d ( QFCs\u201d) to prevent a counterparty's immediate termination of, and limit the exercise of default rights under, the QFCs in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the GSIB or an affiliate of the GSIB. QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (known as repos\u201d) and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On September 27, 2017, and on November 29, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC\u201d) respectively adopted final rules that are both substantively identical to the FRB rule, both effective January 1, 2018, with respect to QFCs entered into with certain FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions.\nThe Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets.\n \u2022 market volatility; and \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nBorrower's Equity.

Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2017, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the FHLBanks had $1.03 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $137.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nBusiness Risk\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and recent changes in the U.S. government administration. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes. Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below.\nThe change in assessments each period was due to a change in income before assessments. If income before assessments increases (decreases), then assessments increases (decreases).\nTerm Federal Funds Sold\nThe Bank utilizes a credit risk rating system for its members, which focuses primarily on an institution's overall financial health and takes into account the quality of assets, earnings, and capital position. The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). In general, borrowers in category 10 may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of the borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. The Bank assigns each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company, such as housing associates, CDFIs, and corporate credit unions, a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each matrix has risk levels that generally correspond to the one to 10 credit risk\n\nExecutive Summary\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank currently has the following two approved Clearinghouses: CME Group, Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Limited. Effective January 3, 2017, CME Clearing made certain amendments to its rulebook changing the legal characterization of variation margin payments to be daily settled payments, rather than collateral. Variation margin on daily settled contracts is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. The Bank continues to characterize variation margin payments with LCH.Clearnet LLC as cash\nreports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\nThe unrealized losses related to U.S. agency and GSE MBS are caused by interest rate changes. Because these securities are guaranteed by government agencies or GSEs, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2017 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Bank does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of +5 years to -5 years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of +7 years to -7 years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nmarketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.\n____________\nTotal noninterest expense remained relatively stable during 2017, 2016, and 2015. During 2016, Other\u201d includes $2 million of voluntary contributions to AHP in excess of regulatory requirements.\ncollateral. At both Clearinghouses, initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilateral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points and 21 basis points for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments on previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which decreased net interest income.\n \u2022 instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; \nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\n____________\nMPP\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank's assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n \u2022 conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate; \n\nLiquidity is necessary to satisfy members' borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank complies with operational liquidity and contingent liquidity, as well as other regulatory requirements. The Bank also performs a separate and independent measure of liquidity, a 45-day liquidity measurement, to validate the level of liquidity reserves.\nGovernment-Guaranteed or -Insured Residential Mortgage Loans\nPrior to 2008, members that were selling mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore the Bank's conventional mortgage loan portfolio is concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.\nThe Bank supplements its interest rate risk analysis by measuring convexity, or the rate of change of effective duration given changes in interest rates. Convexity represents the majority of the change in price not explained by effective duration.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\nCredit Risk\nMortgage Loan Programs\n \u2022 conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and \nThe following table presents the Bank's advances outstanding by year of maturity and the related weighted-average interest rate (dollars in millions):\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\nInvestments\nIf the present value of the expected cash flows of a particular security is less than the security's amortized cost basis, the security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into the following two components: (1) the amount of the total impairment related to credit loss; and (2) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. The portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss that is attributable to the credit loss (that is, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis) is recognized in Noninterest income (loss).\u201d The credit loss on a debt security is limited to the amount of that security's unrealized loss. If the Bank does not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, the portion of the impairment loss that is not attributable to the credit loss is recognized through other comprehensive income.\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nIn its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n____________\nNoninterest Income (Loss)\n \u2022 the hedging strategy; \nDeposits\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\n____________\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nThe efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) and networks are a necessary component of Bank operations. The information systems architecture of the Bank is client/server-based to support the multiple operating systems and servers, which are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed applications. The Bank's IT division maintains and regularly reviews a number of controls to ensure that the IT assets of the Bank are well managed and secure from unauthorized access. Exposure from the internet (and accompanying network security issues, including software virus risk) is a factor that shapes the Bank's risk profile. This exposure results from the Bank's e-commerce activity and an increasing number of specialized vendor-provided solutions that are supported by web-based servers. Management monitors and maintains controls against attempted spyware and anti-virus attacks against Bank systems. The Bank utilizes firewalls to protect the network from internet based attacks while also employing firewalls on laptops that may operate outside of the Bank's network. Additionally, the Bank has systems to detect an intrusion in the event that it is not stopped by one of the firewalls. The Bank also has an information security department that is responsible for the policies, procedures, reviews, education, and management of entitlement requests. One key objective of the information security department is to protect the Bank's sensitive business information from unauthorized access. A security governance committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program, physical security program, security policies and procedures, and security exceptions and violations. The security governance committee reviews all information security-related incidents and escalates them to the executive management committee or the board, as appropriate.\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. For more information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances refer to Note 9-Advances to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nThe Bank. Fourth, the Bank absorbs any remaining unallocated losses.\nIn addition to the cash flow analysis of the Bank's private-label MBS under a base case (best estimate) housing price scenario as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements, a cash flow analysis was also performed based on a housing price scenario that is more adverse than the base case (adverse case housing price scenario). This more stressful scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast, which was five percentage points lower than the base case, followed by a path with annual rates of housing price growth that were 33.0 percent lower than the base case. The base case and adverse case housing price scenarios for credit losses on all other-than temporary impaired private-label MBS were not material for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n___________\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates three times during 2017. This increase in interest rates positively impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation interest expense.\n (3) Nonperforming mortgage loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate. \nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods as has been the case during the current market environment. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments (in millions). The category Fair value hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which hedge accounting is achieved. The category Non-qualifying hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which the derivatives are not in designated hedging relationships that formally meet the hedge accounting requirements under GAAP.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA\u201d). The TCJA makes a variety of changes to U.S. income tax law. Notably, the TCJA:\nIf effective duration of equity or market value of equity is approaching the boundaries of the Bank's RMP ranges, management will initiate remedial action or review alternative strategies at the next meeting of the board of directors or appropriate committee thereof.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's advances is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (Unaudited).\nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nUnder the Bank's RMP, the Bank's market value of equity must not decline by more than 15 percent, assuming an immediate, parallel, and sustained interest-rate shock of 200 basis points in either direction.\n\nUse of Derivatives\n____________\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nThe Bank also invests in government-guaranteed or -insured fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties. Government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans are mortgage loans guaranteed or insured by the VA or the FHA. Any losses from such loans are expected to be recovered from those entities. Any losses from such loans that are not recovered from those entities are absorbed by the servicers. Therefore, the Bank does not record an allowance for credit losses on government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans.\n\nModified loans that are considered a troubled debt restructuring are evaluated individually for impairment when determining the related allowance for credit losses. This credit loss is measured by factoring in expected cash shortfalls (i.e., loss severity rate) incurred as of the reporting date, as well as the economic loss attributable to delaying the original contractual principal and interest due dates.\n\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nThe gradually rising but relatively low interest rate environment has resulted in borrowers strongly favoring short-term advances. Although the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2016 and 2017, and indicated its intention to raise rates further in 2018, the Bank expects this short-term advance preference to continue during 2018. This higher proportion of short-term advances will continue to subject the Bank to advance rollover risk. In addition, members continue to experience high levels of liquidity, which may continue to reduce overall member demand for advances. Although a higher interest rate environment is more favorable for the Bank's total profitability, it may have a negative impact on ROE spread to LIBOR.\nLender Risk Account. Second, the Bank establishes a Lender Risk Account (LRA) for each master commitment to cover losses that are not paid by PMI or borrower's equity. The Bank can establish the amount of the LRA balance either up front as a portion of the purchase proceeds (Fixed LRA) or as a portion of the monthly interest paid by the borrower (Spread LRA).\n \u2022 the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and \nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more than 30 percent. However, the Bank's board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was $27.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nTerm Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 80.8 percent and 78.1 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 4.78 percent and 38.9 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped.\nResults of Operations\n____________\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\n \u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses; and \nOther-than-temporary Impairment\nThe Bank recorded net income of $349 million for 2017, an increase of $71 million, or 25.3 percent, from net income of $278 million for 2016. This increase in net income was primarily due to increased interest rates during the year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017, and December 2017.\n\nSupplemental Mortgage Insurance. Third, losses for each master commitment in excess of the LRA, up to a specified LTV ratio, are covered by SMI obtained by the PFI. In the MPP, SMI generally covers mortgages with an LTV ratio of 45 percent or greater. In addition, SMI policies for master commitments in excess of $35 million contain an aggregate loss limit whereby the total amount payable by the SMI insurer under the policy is less than the total unpaid principal balances of the insured loans. MPP master commitments entered into in 2017 do not have SMI policies.\n \u2022 interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs); \nAdvances\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the TCJA and its effects on our business and results of operation, as well as the effect, if any, that it may have on our members, the U.S. economy, and the U.S. housing market more generally.\nThe adverse case housing price scenario and associated results do not represent the Bank's current expectations and therefore, should not be construed as a prediction of the Bank's future results, market conditions, or the actual performance of these securities. Rather, the results from this hypothetical adverse case housing price scenario provide a measure of the credit losses that the Bank might incur if home price declines (and subsequent recoveries) are more adverse than those projected in the Bank's base case assessment.\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nMPF Program\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\n \u2022 the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and \n(1) Collateral held with respect to derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\n \u2022 Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations. \nThe FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes. These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank's compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n(1) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would purchase the securities. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, as these investments amounted to 290 percent and 288 percent of regulatory capital, respectively.\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nThe Bank experienced an increase in unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties from $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 to $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. The following four counterparties each represented greater than 10 percent and collectively represented 53.2 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties: Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of Nova Scotia, Cooperatieve Rabobank UA, and Wells Fargo Bank. As of December 31, 2017, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nFair Value Measurements\n\nNet interest income was $157 million for 2017, a decrease of $177 million, from net interest income of $334 million for 2016. This decrease was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances that occurred during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017, which reduced net interest income for the year. This decrease in net interest income related to the prepayment of previous restructured and redesignated advances was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income.\n \u2022 legislative and regulatory changes that could affect the Bank's cost of doing business or alter the Bank's business model. \n____________\n \u2022 Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent on the Bank's balance sheet and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses. \nattractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders relative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about the Bank's dividends declared during 2017 and 2016 is contained in Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n \u2022 Reputation - recognize the importance of and promote positive awareness and perception of the Bank and its mission among key external stakeholders impacting the Bank's ability to achieve its mission. \n \u2022 Mission/Business Model - (1) deliver financial services and consistent access to affordable funds that are the size and structure shareholders desire, helping them to manage risk and extend credit in their communities, while achieving the Bank's affordable housing mission goals; and (2) provide value through the consistent payment of dividends and the repurchasing of excess stock. \nproposition that allows the Bank to build, retain, engage, and develop staff to meet the evolving needs of the Bank's key stakeholders and effectively manage enterprise-wide risks; and (3) manage the key risks associated with cyber security threats.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \n \u2022 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.  Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 11, 2017, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2017 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nof both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy has experienced strong growth over the last three quarters of 2017, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect - either positive or negative - on the Bank's financial performance.\nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. The Bank reports all ineffectiveness for qualifying hedges and non-qualifying hedges in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income within Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank's derivative position includes interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways:\nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nFinancial Condition\n \u2022 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. \nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of its members and borrowers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources.\nrating for insured depository institutions and insurance companies. Development of these risk matrices for borrowers that are not insured depository institutions or insurance companies enables the Bank to monitor and analyze the financial condition of these borrowers in a more consistent and complete manner. The par value of advances to these institutions totaled $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2017. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds during 2017. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\n (2) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nIf the Bank determines that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Bank accounts for the investment security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the other-than-temporary impairment loss at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis, less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in income. For debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the security.\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nConventional Residential Mortgage Loans\nLIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate Developments. In July 2017, the FCA, the regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA confirmed in November 2017 that all 20 panel banks providing submissions for LIBOR determination will continue to support the rate through 2021 and work towards developing an alternative benchmark. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board proposed an alternative rate in June 2017 and in August 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal to begin publishing that rate and two other alternative\nNet Income\n \u2022 determination of the appropriate accounting designation; \nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 limits some housing-related tax deductions by limiting the mortgage interest deductions to the first $750 thousand in principal value of mortgages, limiting the state and local tax deduction to a combined $10 thousand for income, sales, and property taxes, and for alternative minimum taxpayers, eliminating the deduction for home equity loan interest, all of which changes may particularly affect states with higher property values and/or higher state and local taxes; and \n____________\nFHLBank Capital Requirements. On July 3, 2017, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule to adopt, with amendments, the regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Board (predecessor to the Finance Agency) pertaining to the capital requirements for the FHLBanks. The proposed rule would carry over most of the existing regulations without material change but would substantively revise the credit risk component of the risk-based capital requirement, as well as the limitations on extensions of unsecured credit. The main revisions would remove the requirement that the FHLBanks calculate credit risk capital charges and unsecured credit limits based on ratings issued by a NRSRO, and instead, require that the FHLBanks establish and use their own internal rating methodology. With respect to derivatives, the proposed rule would impose a new capital charge for cleared derivatives, which under the existing rule do not carry a capital charge, to align with the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing mandate. The proposed rule also would revise the percentages used in the regulation's tables to calculate credit risk capital charges for advances and non-mortgage assets. The Finance Agency proposes to retain, for now, the percentages used in the tables to calculate capital charges for mortgage-related assets, and to address the methodology for residential mortgage assets at a later date. The Bank submitted a joint comment letter with the other FHLBanks on August 31, 2017. The Bank is continuing to evaluate the proposed rules but does not expect this rule, if adopted in final form, to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.\n\n \u2022 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. \nIn addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties.\nprovide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank.\n \u2022 instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; \nThe Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank's business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments related to operational risk and overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk.\nAdvances\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $146.6 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion, or 5.69 percent, from December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $3.8 billion, or 37.0 percent, increase in other investments, and a $3.4 billion, or 3.39 percent, increase in advances.\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Allowance for Credit Losses to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for a further discussion of management's estimate of credit losses.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements.\nThe board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and constantly being presented. Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nThe primary source of the Bank's earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\n \u2022 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; \nAdvances and Standby Letters of Credit\n \u2022 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; \nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nDuring 2017, two significant hurricanes impacted the southeastern coasts of the United States. On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas and caused substantial damage and flooding to southeastern Texas, including the Houston metropolitan area. On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall on the Florida mainland near Marco Island, Florida. Hurricane Irma then moved northward through Florida and into Georgia, causing significant damage to property in Florida, Georgia, and certain other southeastern states.\n____________\nBorrower's Equity and Primary Mortgage Insurance. The first layer of protection against loss is the borrower's equity in the real property securing the MPP loan and PMI where applicable.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and do not include related accrued interest receivable of $36 million as of December 31, 2017. \nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\n(4) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract.\nrates beginning in 2018. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate interest rate indices or reference rates. The Bank is not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve Board proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will be on the Bank's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n \u2022 Governance/Compliance/Legal - compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and manage other legal exposures. \n \u2022 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and \nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Bank manages MPF Program credit risk through underwriting and eligibility guidelines and sharing of potential losses with the PFIs. The Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on MPF loans by structuring potential losses on conventional MPF loans into layers with respect to each master commitment. The general allocation of losses under the MPF Program is divided into the following loss layers:\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions). \n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and do not include related accrued interest receivable of $35 million as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Market Risk/Earnings - maintain an adequate ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR, while providing attractive funding for advance products, consistent payment of dividends, reliable access to funding, and maintenance of retained earnings in excess of stressed retained earnings targets within a conservative risk management framework. \nThe Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration and convexity of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was seven basis points, 21 basis points, and 17 basis points for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread from 2016 to 2017, and the increase in interest-rate spread from 2015 to 2016, was primarily due to the increased accelerated amortization related to prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 and 2015 as previously discussed, compared to the lower accelerated amortization during 2016.\n \u2022 Fair Value Measurements; \nThe increase in total investments was primarily due to an increase in total other investments from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The amount held in other investments will vary each day based on the Bank's liquidity requirements as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The Bank ceased purchasing private-label MBS in 2008.\n \u2022 macro hedging of balance sheet risks. \n(1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\nThe increase in net interest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to decreased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2016, compared to 2015. These prepayments resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization during 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced net interest income for those years. These decreases in net interest income were offset by corresponding increases in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The remaining change in net interest income was due to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December 2015. This increase in interest rates impacted consolidated obligation interest expense more than the offsetting increase in advance interest income.\n\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance; and (2) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations.\n\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate\n\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to obtain eligible collateral from borrowers to protect against potential credit losses. Eligible collateral is defined by statute and regulation. The Bank monitors the financial condition of borrowers and regularly verifies the existence and characteristics of a risk-based sample of mortgage collateral pledged to secure advances. Each borrower's collateral requirements and the scope and frequency of its collateral verification reviews are dependent upon certain risk factors. Since its establishment in 1932, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance or standby letter of credit. Based on the collateral held as security, the Bank's collateral policies, credit analysis, and the repayment history on advances, the Bank did not anticipate any credit losses on advances or standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accordingly, the Bank has not recorded any allowance for credit losses on advances, nor has the Bank recorded any liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Credit Risk for further discussion regarding the Bank's credit risk policies and practice.\nAdvances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 increased by 3.39 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2017 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 57.9\n\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 4.97 percent for 2017, compared to 4.08 percent for 2016. This increase in ROE was primarily due to an increase in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR increased to 371 basis points for 2017, compared to 334 basis points for 2016. This increase in the ROE spread to LIBOR was primarily due to the increase in ROE.\nThe Bank had previously ceased purchasing new mortgage loans in 2008. However, in December 2016, the Bank agreed to purchase a 90 percent participating interest in a $100 million master commitment of certain newly acquired MPP loans from the FHLBank Indianapolis. Principal amounts settled totaled $18 million and $72 million in January 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year, partially offset by new mortgage loans acquired through the participation in the master commitment with the FHLBank Indianapolis.\n\n \u2022 Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; \nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 69.9 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2017 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nThe following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activity on the Bank's results of operations (in millions):\nThe increase in total noninterest income during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to restructured and redesignated advances that were prepaid prior to their maturity during 2017, which resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during the year. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income during the year and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates during 2017. Additionally, the decreased losses on trading securities were primarily due to a smaller trading securities portfolio size in 2017, compared to 2016.\n (1) Interest-bearing deposits include a $401 million and $1.1 billion, business money market account with Branch Banking and Trust Company, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a $46 million business money market account with United Bank one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017. \nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\n____________\npercent and 64.2 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed-rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates on them, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which are based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 42.1 percent and 44.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 0.27 percent and 0.68 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances were swapped. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, or constant maturity swap rates.\nPrimary Mortgage Insurance. The second layer of protection comes from primary mortgage insurance (PMI) that is required for any MPF loan with a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent at the time of origination.\n____________\nThe Bank evaluates its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n \u2022 competition for advances from traditional and nontraditional sources; and \nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nMember Credit Enhancement. Fourth, for loans purchased under each master commitment, losses in excess of the FLA, up to an agreed-upon amount, called the credit enhancement or CE Amount,\u201d are incurred by the PFI. For MPF Plus, this CE Amount includes supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI). The member's CE Amount is sized using the MPF Program methodology to limit the amount of the Bank's losses in excess of, or including, the FLA (depending on the MPF product) to those that would be expected to be experienced by an investor in an MBS that is rated AA under the S&P LEVELS ratings methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency). Pursuant to the Finance Agency's amended regulation on acquired member assets (AMA), effective January 18, 2017, the MPF Program methodology was adjusted to set the PFI's CE Amount consistent with the Bank's determination, with respect to an asset or pool, based on documented analysis, that the Bank has a high degree of confidence that it will not bear material losses beyond the losses absorbed by the FLA, even under reasonably likely adverse changes to expected economic conditions. The CE Amount and the FLA for certain conventional MPF products held in the Bank's portfolio is determined at inception of each loan pool master commitment and may be periodically reset lower for each master commitment after a required period of seasoning because the amount of credit enhancement necessary to maintain the Bank's risk of credit losses within its risk tolerance is usually reduced over time. In one MPF product, the PFI is required to obtain and pay for SMI, for which the Bank is the insured party. The Bank pays the PFI a monthly credit enhancement fee for managing credit risk on the MPF Program loans. In most cases, the credit enhancement fees are performance based, which further motivates the PFI to minimize loan losses on MPF Program loans.\nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2017.\nFirst Loss Account. Third, losses for each master commitment that are not paid by PMI, up to an agreed-upon amount, are incurred by the Bank up to a pre-specified amount that is tracked in what is called a First Loss Account,\u201d or FLA\u201d. The FLA represents the amount of expected losses that the Bank incurs before the PFI's credit enhancement becomes available to cover losses. For MPF products with performance based credit enhancement fees (e.g., MPF Plus), the Bank may withhold credit enhancement fees to recover losses at the FLA level, essentially transferring a portion of the first layer risk of credit loss to the PFI.\n (1) Volume change is calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the previous rate, while rate change is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the previous volume. The rate/volume change, calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of its total. \nNoninterest Expense and Assessments\nFor those securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment was determined to have occurred during 2017, a summary of the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings is contained in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements.\n \u2022 the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases; \nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nThe unpaid principal balance of MPP mortgage loans was $124 million and $126 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on MPP loans was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough the Bank is not a covered entity under these rules, as a counterparty to covered entities under QFCs, the Bank may be required to amend QFCs entered into with FRB-regulated GSIBs or applicable FDIC- and OCC-supervised institutions. These rules may impact our ability to terminate business relationships with covered entities and could adversely impact the amount the Bank recovers in the event of the bankruptcy or receivership of a covered entity. However, the Bank does not expect these final rules to materially affect the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.\nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. For example, as discussed above, if the derivatives qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is included in net interest income and in the calculation of interest-rate spread. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\n\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nNon-Private-label MBS\n \u2022 changes tax rules for some classes of FHLBank members by limiting tax deductions for FDIC premiums paid by banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets and amending a variety of tax provisions applicable to insurance companies. \n \u2022 other factors, including default and loss rates. \nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 31, 2017, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 16, 2017.\n \u2022 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and \nConsolidated Obligations\nThe Bank has established an internal liquidity measurement separate from the Finance Agency requirements described above. The Bank performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that liquidity reserves are sufficient to service debt obligations for at least 45 days. This analysis assumes no access to debt market issuance and other management assumptions, which are completely independent of the operational and contingent liquidity calculation measured above. The Bank met its 45 day internal liquidity goal throughout 2017.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, changes in money market fund investment regulations during 2016 have caused the Bank to experience increased demand from the mutual fund industry for short-term GSE debt, which the Bank expects to continue in 2018. Earnings on the Bank's investment portfolio will continue to be affected by tighter interest rate spreads on new investments as older investments with wider spreads prepay or mature. There is uncertainty, in light of recent changes in the U.S. government administration and recent executive actions, about regulatory changes that could occur in the financial services industry, and what impact those changes could have on the Bank and/or its members.\nAll other conventional residential mortgage loans are evaluated collectively for impairment. The allowance for these loans is determined by an analysis (performed at least quarterly) that includes segregating the portfolio into various aging groups. For loans that are 60 days or less past due, the Bank calculates a loss severity, default rate, and the expected loss based on individual loan characteristics. For loans that are more than 60 days past due, the allowance is determined using an automated valuation model.\n(1) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\n (1) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \n \u2022 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; \nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The increase in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was a result of increased funding and liquidity needs during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $146.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 93.7 percent as of December 31, 2016.\n____________\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to\n\nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nThe following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used to evaluate each of the Bank's private-label MBS for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2017.\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance, as well as systemic Federal Reserve wire transfer system disruptions. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\n(3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by limiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\nBusiness Outlook\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines. In some circumstances, the Bank may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with specified provisions of the MPP guidelines.\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nThe Bank evaluates its individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities that are in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The Bank recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss when the Bank determines that it will not recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. Securities in the Bank's private-label MBS portfolio that are in an unrealized loss position are evaluated by estimating the projected cash flows using a model that incorporates projections and assumptions based on the structure of the security and certain economic environment assumptions, such as delinquency and default rates, loss severity, home price appreciation, interest rates, and securities prepayment speeds, while factoring in the underlying collateral and credit enhancement.\n(1) Economic Development and Growth Enhancement Program\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\n (1) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\n \u2022 mortgage loan prepayment rates decrease and result in lower levels of mortgage loan refinance activity, which may result in the reduction of Bank advances to members as increased rates tend to slow home sales. \nMortgage loans purchased under the MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards established and maintained by FHLBank Chicago. In some circumstances, the Bank, with the concurrence of FHLBank Chicago, may grant a PFI a waiver exempting it from complying with these standards. The Bank has granted a limited number of such waivers related to documentation requirements or accepted alternate underwriting criteria in circumstances in which such waivers would not materially affect the value of the asset.\nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks. The Bank's board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to restructured and redesignated advances that were prepaid prior to their maturity during 2016 and 2015, which resulted in $16 million and $181 million of accelerated amortization, respectively. This accelerated amortization, as previously discussed, reduced net interest income during the years and was offset by corresponding increases in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining\nNet interest income for the years presented was affected by changes in average balances (volume change) and changes in average rates (rate change) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the extent to which volume changes and rate changes affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense (in millions). As presented in the table below, the overall changes in net interest income between 2017 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2015, were primarily rate related.\nThe Bank continues to actively monitor the credit quality of its private-label MBS investments. It is not possible to predict the magnitude of additional other-than-temporary impairment losses in future periods because that prediction depends on the actual performance of the underlying loan collateral, as well as the Bank's future modeling assumptions. Many factors could influence the Bank's future modeling assumptions, including economic, financial market, and housing market conditions. If performance of the underlying loan collateral deteriorates and/or the Bank's modeling assumptions become more pessimistic, the Bank could experience further losses on its investment portfolio.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n (4) Includes amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \n \u2022 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; \nNet Interest Income\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\n____________\nThe following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (in millions): \nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps; and convexity characteristics under assumed changes in interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and market basis relationships. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nGeneral\n \u2022 As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income as Net gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility. \nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which are typically rated AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit enhancements, which primarily consisted of the subordination of the claims of the other tranches of these securities. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance,\nInformation Security Management Advisory Bulletin. On September 28, 2017, the FHFA issued an Advisory Bulletin that supersedes previous guidance on an FHLBank's information security program. The Advisory Bulletin describes three main components of an information security program and provides the expectation that each FHLBank will use a risk-based approach to implement its information security program. The Advisory Bulletin contains expectations related to (i) governance, including guidance related to roles and responsibilities, risk assessments, industry standards, and cyber-insurance; (ii) engineering and architecture, including guidance on network security, software security, and security of endpoints; and (iii) operations, including guidance on continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, baseline configuration, asset life cycle, awareness and training, incident response and recovery, user access management, data classification and protection, oversight of third parties, and threat intelligence sharing.\nIn connection with the foregoing proposed modifications to the risk-based capital requirements, the Finance Agency also announced that it would issue new minimum regulatory liquidity requirements for the FHLBanks in a separate rulemaking or guidance. To the extent that new regulations or guidance increase the Bank's liquidity requirements in the future, the Bank's business activities and operations could be adversely affected.\n____________\nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, the Bank would have been required to deliver up to an additional $9 million of collateral (at fair value) to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank has established formal policies and procedures to monitor its exposure to mortgage insurance companies, including a cap on the aggregate amount of permissible exposure to SMI at each provider.\n(1) The classification of securities is based on current characteristics and performance, which may be different from the securities' classification as determined\nGeneral\nPrivate-label MBS\nAll of the FHLBanks entered into a Capital Agreement, which is intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank. Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) additional retained earnings equal to two quarters of dividends, based on the current dividend rate and current stock balance. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an\nThe Bank is required to assess potential credit losses and establish an allowance for credit losses, if required, for each identified portfolio segment of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is the level at which the Bank develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The Bank has established a reserve methodology for each of the following portfolio segments of financing receivables: advances and standby letters of credit, conventional residential mortgage loans, government-guaranteed or -insured residential mortgage loans, term federal funds sold, and term securities purchased under agreements to resell.\nby the originator at the time of origination.\nEffects of Inflation\n\nCyclicality and Seasonality\n(1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\nInterest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\n\nOperational Risk\n \u2022 the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases; \nThe Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2017 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and \n \u2022 Operational Risk - (1) manage the key risks associated with operational availability of critical systems, the integrity and security of the Bank's information, and the alignment of technology investment with key business objectives through enterprise-wide risk management practices and governance based on industry standards; (2) deliver an employee value \n\nFinancial Condition\nThe PFI's recourse is limited to this predetermined LRA amount so that the PFI has no further obligation to make additional contributions to the LRA, regardless of any losses or deterioration of the mortgage pool exceeding such amount in the LRA. Once the LRA has reached the required amount, but not before five years for the Fixed LRA, the Bank will pay the PFI any unused amounts of the LRA that are no longer required to cover expected losses on an annual basis in accordance with a step-down schedule that is established at the time of a master commitment.\n\nRefer to the respective footnotes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the contractual obligations and commitments listed in the above table.\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\nTerm federal funds sold are generally short-term, their recorded balance approximates fair value, and they are transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. If the Bank's investment in federal funds sold is not paid when due, it is evaluated for purposes of an allowance for credit losses. All investments in federal funds sold are unsecured and were repaid or expected to be repaid according to the contracted terms as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for federal funds sold as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u2022 Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring, and verification. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk. \nTotal credit enhancement is sized to provide the equivalent of at least a BBB rating under the S&P LEVELS rating methodology (although the assets are not rated by S&P or any other agency).", "item_7_tables": "Table 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- The report discusses the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and results of operations for 2017, 2016, and 2015. It explains changes in key financial statement items and the primary factors driving those changes.\n\nKey Results\n- Net income was $349 million in 2017, up 25.3% from 2016, primarily due to increased interest rates and net gains on derivatives. \n- Total assets grew 5.69% to $146.6 billion in 2017, mainly due to increases in advances and other investments.\n\nRisk Management \n- The Bank faces various risks including market, liquidity, credit, operational, and business risks. It has a robust risk management framework to align risk-taking with strategy and risk appetite.\n- Key risks discussed include interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk concentration, competition, regulatory changes, and cyber threats.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Critical accounting policies that involve significant judgment and estimates include fair value measurements, derivatives and hedging activities, allowance for credit losses, and other-than-temporary impairment assessments.\n\nOutlook\n- Uncertainty remains around regulatory changes, interest rates, member demand for advances, and other economic factors that could impact earnings. The Bank continues to actively monitor risks and external conditions.\n\nThat covers some of the key points on the Bank's financial performance, risk management, critical accounting estimates, and outlook.
