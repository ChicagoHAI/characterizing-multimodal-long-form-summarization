Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe Express-Platte acquisition and the U.S. Assets Dropdown have been accounted for as acquisitions under common control, resulting in the recast of our prior results, excluding distributable cash flow. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $1,225 million in 2015 compared with $1,004 million in 2014 mainly due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, and higher transportation revenues due to higher tariff rates and volumes on the Express and Platte pipelines. Distributable cash flow was $1,205 million in 2015 compared with $1,055 million in 2014.\nWe increased our quarterly cash distribution each quarter in 2015, from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 which was paid in February 2015, to $0.63875 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 which is payable on February 26, 2016. We intend to increase our quarterly distribution by at least one and a quarter cents per unit each quarter through 2018. The declaration and payment of distributions is subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, our partnership agreement and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nWe invested $2.0 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2015, including $1.7 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $2.4 billion planned for 2016, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity investments, and various financing transactions, which may include issuances of short-term and long-term debt, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly unit issuances. We expect to maintain an investment-grade capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. Therefore, we will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity, and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing these growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuances of debt and/or equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, we have access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program.\nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas and crude oil infrastructure to premium markets. We will grow our business through organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\n\u2022Building off the strength of our asset base.\n\u2022Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service.\n\u2022Effectively executing the projects we have secured.\n\u2022Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments.\n\u2022Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.\nNatural gas supply dynamics continue to rapidly change, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions\nthrough to the last mile of pipe in growing natural gas and crude oil markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCrude oil supply dynamics continue to evolve as North American oil production has shifted from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production has displaced more expensive imports from overseas which drove increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices have resulted in declining North American oil production at this time, lower prices are also stimulating new demand which will also show up over the next couple years. This natural cycle along with the realization of significant crude oil resources in North America which has enabled the removal of the crude oil export ban allows us to remain confident about prospects for long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future opportunities to grow our crude oil pipeline business.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on successfully maintaining our leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the successful execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued production and the consumption of natural gas and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the United States and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil and/or natural gas, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas transmitted and gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect gathering revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transmission and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern United States-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental United States average growth rates through 2019. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector and other new industrial gas demands, including LNG. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore. The national supply profile is shifting to new sources of gas from natural gas shale basins in the Rockies, Midcontinent, Appalachia, Texas and Louisiana. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we will pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent community and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from the natural gas shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S., these pressures could increase costs and/or cause a slowdown in the production of natural gas from these basins, and therefore, could negatively affect our growth plans.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states with growing connectivity to the Gulf Coast of the United States. Growth in our business is dependent on growing crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to compete with imported crude oil from overseas. While the recent decline in crude oil prices has not adversely affected our existing crude oil pipeline business, it does adversely affect producers' ability to grow or even sustain current production. While we do expect oil prices to recover, the current low price environment will challenge the economic viability or need for any new significant infrastructure. As global demand for crude oil grows and with the ability to export crude, we do expect growth potential in North American to return. Sustained low oil prices could eventually have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\nThe shift to and increase in natural gas supply have resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher natural gas liquids (NGL) content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the\nseasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively impacting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\nOur businesses in the United States and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate offsite impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the U.S. Department of Transportation. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities. Significant cost increases could negatively affect the returns ultimately earned on current and future expansions.\nFor further information related to management's assessment of our risk factors, see Part I.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments are managed centrally, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income, are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its continuing operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nOur U.S. Transmission business primarily provides transmission and storage of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern United States. Our Liquids business provides transportation of crude oil for customers in central United States and Canada.\nSegment EBITDA is summarized in the following table.

Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport specified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nLiquids\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Express pipeline revenue receipts, MBbl/d (a,b)\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platte PADD II deliveries, MBbl/d (b)\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________\n(a) Thousand barrels per day.\n(b) Data includes activity since March 14, 2013, the date of the acquisition of Express-Platte by Spectra Energy.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills.

This entails connecting, where possible, to rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nSee Matters Affecting Future U.S. Transmission Results for discussions of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 and PHMSA, which are also applicable to the Liquids segment.\nOther\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Expenses.

Other drivers include the timing of certain cash outflows, such as capital expenditures for maintenance.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Distributable Cash Flow\u201d\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) (a)\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>1,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity investments\n</td> <td>(167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions from equity investments (b)\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment at Ozark Gas Gathering\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity AFUDC\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash paid for income taxes\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment (c)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________\n(a) Tax benefit in 2013 is due to the elimination of deferred income tax liabilities related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\n(b) Excludes $403 million, $129 million, and $63 million of distributions from equity investments for the 2015, 2014, and 2013 periods, respectively.\n(c) Removes the results of the U.S. Assets Dropdown for the periods prior to the dropdown (January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013) and the results of Express-Platte for the periods prior to the dropdown (March 14, 2013 to August 1, 2013).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually\nassess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required to be recognized. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $326 million as of December 31, 2015 and $290 million as of December 31, 2014. Total regulatory liabilities were $25 million as of December 31, 2015 and $29 million as of December 31, 2014.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nWe had goodwill balances of $3,232 million at December 31, 2015 and $3,244 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in goodwill in 2015 was the result of foreign currency translation. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nAs permitted under the accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\nWe performed either a quantitative assessment or a qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill as of April 1, 2015 (our annual testing date). Based on that assessment, we determined that this condition, for each reporting unit, does not exist. As such, performing the first step of the two-step impairment test for these units was unnecessary. No triggering events occurred during the period from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 that warranted re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from the transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas, and from the transportation of crude oil are recognized when the service is provided. Revenues related to these services provided but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of $927 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $476 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $283 million, and a payable to an equity investment of $148 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity affiliates, and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. We have access to a revolving credit facility, with available capacity of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. This facility is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program, which is used to manage working capital requirements and for temporary funding of capital expenditures. We expect to be self-funding and plan to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years. Capital resources may continue to include commercial paper, short-term borrowings under our current credit facility and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity.\nCash flows from operations are fairly stable given that substantially all of our revenues and those of our equity investments are derived from operations under firm contracts. However, total operating cash flows are subject to a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, contract renewal rates and cash distributions from our equity investments. The amount of cash distributed to us by our equity investments and the amount of cash we may be required to fund, is determined by our equity investments based on their operating cash flows and other factors as determined by their management. While we participate on the management committees of these equity investments, determination of the amount of distributions and contributions, if any, are not within our control. We received total distributions from equity investments of $610 million in 2015, $294 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of other factors that could affect our cash flows.\nAs a result of our ongoing strong earnings performance expected in existing operations, we expect to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. We will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,077\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(237\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $189 million to $1,522 million in 2015 compared to 2014.

These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. Given our objective of growth through acquisitions, we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to acquire assets. Expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills. In consideration for this transaction, we retired 21,560,000 of our common units and 440,000 of our general partner units held by Spectra Energy, which will result in the reduction of any associated distribution payable to Spectra Energy, beginning in 2016. There will also be a reduction in the aggregate quarterly distributions, if any, to Spectra Energy, (as holder of incentive distribution rights), by $4 million per quarter for a period of 12 consecutive quarters commencing with the quarter ending on December 31, 2015 and ending with the quarter ending on September 30, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOn November 4, 2015, we acquired the remaining 0.1% ownership interest in SESH from Spectra Energy. Total consideration was 17,114 newly issued common units. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. This is the last of three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nIn November 2014, we completed the second of the three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. This transaction consisted of acquiring an additional 24.95% ownership interest in SESH and the remaining 1% ownership interest in Steckman Ridge. Total consideration was approximately 4.3 million newly issued common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nIn November 2013, we completed the closing of substantially all of the U.S. Assets Dropdown, including Spectra Energy's remaining 60% interest in the U.S. portion of Express-Platte. We paid Spectra Energy aggregate consideration with the issuance of approximately 171.1 million newly issued partnership units and $2.3 billion in cash. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nIn August 2013, we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Express US and a 100% ownership interest in Express Canada from subsidiaries of Spectra Energy for $410 million in cash and 7.2 million of newly issued common and general partner units. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCapital expansion projects are developed and executed using results-proven project management processes. We evaluate the strategic fit and commercial and execution risks, and continuously measure performance compared to plan. Ongoing communications between project teams and senior leadership ensure we maintain the right focus and deliver the expected results. We expect that significant natural gas infrastructure, including both natural gas transportation and storage with links to growing gas supplies and markets, will be needed over time to serve growth in gas-fired power generation, oil-to-gas conversions, industrial development and attachments to new gas supply.\nExpansion capital expenditures included several key projects placed into service in 2015, including:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ohio Pipeline Energy Network (OPEN) - A 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) expansion of the Texas Eastern pipeline system consisting of new pipeline, a new compressor station and other associated facility upgrades.

On March 12, 2015, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 4.50% senior notes due in 2045. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.\nCommon Unit Issuances. On November 4, 2015, we issued 17,114 common units in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $1 million. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nIn March 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common units up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, and in December 2015 we replaced the equity distribution agreement. The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in our previous agreements and allow us to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows us to offer and sell common units at prices deemed appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between the sales agent and us.\nWe issued 12 million common units to the public in 2015 under our at-the-market program, and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $557 million, including approximately $11 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2014\nCommon Unit Issuances. In November 2014, we issued 4.3 million common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $186 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.\nIn 2014, we issued 6.4 million common units to the public under our at-the-market program and 132,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $334 million, including $7 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2013\nDebt Issuances.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\nWe issued 0.6 million common units to the public in 2013 under our at-the-market program, for total net proceeds of $24 million.\nIn August 2013, we issued 7.1 million common units and 0.1 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the acquisition of Express-Platte, valued at $319 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Express-Platte.\nIn April 2013, we issued 5.2 million common units to the public and 0.1 million general partner units. Total net proceeds were $193 million. The net proceeds from this issuance were temporarily invested in restricted available-for-sale securities until the Express-Platte dropdown, at which time the funds were partially used to pay for a portion of the transaction.

As of December 31, 2015, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the agreements. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, the credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of us or of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs noted above, the terms of the credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to- Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreements, of 5.0 to 1 or less. As of December 31, 2015 this ratio was 3.6 to 1.\nTerm Loan Agreement. In November 2013, we entered into and borrowed $400 million under a senior unsecured five-year term loan agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowing was used to pay Spectra Energy for the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\nCash Distributions. The partnership agreement requires that, within 60 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our Available Cash, as defined, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date.\nWe increased the quarterly cash distributions each quarter of 2015 from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $0.63875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2015. The cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 was declared on February 3, 2016 and is payable on February 26, 2016.\nOur Board of Directors evaluates each individual quarterly distribution decision based on an assessment of growth in cash available to make distributions. Growth in our cash available to make distributions over time is dependent on incremental organic growth expansion, third-party acquisitions or acquisitions from Spectra Energy. Our amount of Available Cash depends primarily upon our cash flows, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record a net loss for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes.\nOther Financing Matters. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of limited partner common units and various debt securities and another registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of $1 billion, in the aggregate, of limited partner common units and various debt securities over time. This registration statement has $944 million available as of December 31, 2015.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements and financings entered into by equity investments. These debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligation in the event of specified declines in credit ratings.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as Total Current Liabilities on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet other than Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt.

We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Spectra Energy is responsible for the overall governance of managing our interest rate risk and credit risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Our exposure generally relates to receivables and unbilled revenue for services provided, as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by us generally under park and loan services and no-notice services. Our principal customers for natural gas transmission and storage services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the United States. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the United States. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. We have concentrations of receivables from these industry sectors. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively affect the credit quality of the entire sector.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash\ndeposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage and gathering services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on an evaluation by Spectra Energy), or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any customer.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had interest rate hedges in place for various purposes. We are party to pay floating-receive fixed\u201d interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $16 million. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2014, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2015 than in 2014, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $15 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short-term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOTHER ISSUES\nFor information on other issues, see Notes 5 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion.", "item_7_truncated": "EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Expiration\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nCredit Facility\nCapacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial\nPaper Outstanding at\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nCredit Facility\nCapacity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spectra Energy Partners, LP\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 lower ad valorem tax accruals, \nOther Income and Expenses.

Income Tax Expense. The $383 million increase was mainly due to the elimination of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of the U.S. Assets Dropdown and resulting changes in tax status of certain entities in 2013.\nThe credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the agreements. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.

In addition, the credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of us or of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nCapital expansion projects are developed and executed using results-proven project management processes. We evaluate the strategic fit and commercial and execution risks, and continuously measure performance compared to plan. Ongoing communications between project teams and senior leadership ensure we maintain the right focus and deliver the expected results. We expect that significant natural gas infrastructure, including both natural gas transportation and storage with links to growing gas supplies and markets, will be needed over time to serve growth in gas-fired power generation, oil-to-gas conversions, industrial development and attachments to new gas supply.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our principal customers for natural gas transmission and storage services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the United States. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the United States. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities.

The $12 million increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Sand Hills due to increased volumes, partially offset by the disposition of Sand Hills and Southern Hills on October 30, 2015.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the U.S. Department of Transportation. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nIn March 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common units up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, and in December 2015 we replaced the equity distribution agreement. The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in our previous agreements and allow us to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows us to offer and sell common units at prices deemed appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between the sales agent and us.\nOur businesses in the United States and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $336 million in 2015 compared to $237 million used in financing activities in 2014. This $573 million change was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 higher processing revenues mainly due to volumes, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $10 million increase in operating costs mostly due to repairs and maintenance, \nOther Income and Expenses, Net. The $45 million increase was mainly attributable to higher allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) from higher capital spending on expansion projects.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nU.S. Transmission \n \u2022 a $5 million decrease from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $69 million increase was mainly due to higher AFUDC from higher capital spending on expansion projects and higher equity earnings mainly due to the dropdown of an additional 24.95% interest in SESH in November 2014.\nThe issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amount available under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nseasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively impacting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on EBITDA transactions. Cash, cash equivalents and investments are managed centrally, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income, are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its continuing operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nCrude oil supply dynamics continue to evolve as North American oil production has shifted from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production has displaced more expensive imports from overseas which drove increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices have resulted in declining North American oil production at this time, lower prices are also stimulating new demand which will also show up over the next couple years. This natural cycle along with the realization of significant crude oil resources in North America which has enabled the removal of the crude oil export ban allows us to remain confident about prospects for long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future opportunities to grow our crude oil pipeline business.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nAs permitted under the accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\n \u2022 higher recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $25 million decrease in gas storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $53 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 the restructuring of an intercompany loan contributed to us as part of the U.S. Assets Dropdown, partially offset by \n \u2022 lower natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin, and \n (c) Purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nCommon Unit Issuances. In November 2014, we issued 4.3 million common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $186 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.\n \u2022 an $80 million increase in distributions received from equity investments in 2014, comprised mostly of a $99 million distribution from SESH with proceeds from a SESH debt offering, \n(b) Excludes $403 million, $129 million, and $63 million of distributions from equity investments for the 2015, 2014, and 2013 periods, respectively.\nOther Income and Expenses. The $28 million decrease was mainly attributable to lower AFUDC resulting from decreased capital spending on expansion projects.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n \u2022 a $137 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, and \n \u2022 $441 million of net redemptions of long-term debt in 2014 compared to $2,241 million of net issuances in 2013, which were mostly used to fund the U.S. Assets Dropdown, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher earnings in 2014, after adjusting for non-cash items primarily consisting of a $381 million change in deferred income taxes, partially offset by \n \u2022 an $8 million increase in operating costs, net of employee benefit costs, partially offset by \n \u2022 lower employee benefit costs, and \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTerm Loan Agreement.

A portion of the proceeds from the borrowing was used to pay Spectra Energy for the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\nFor information on other issues, see Notes 5 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 a $7 million increase in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 the acquisition of Express-Platte in March 2013, \n \u2022 a $2,210 million net cash outlay for the U.S. Assets Dropdown in 2013,  \u2022a $343 million net cash outlay for the acquisition of Express-Platte in 2013,\n \u2022 earnings from equity investments, \n \u2022 equity AFUDC, \n2014 Compared to 2013\nWe increased our quarterly cash distribution each quarter in 2015, from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 which was paid in February 2015, to $0.63875 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 which is payable on February 26, 2016. We intend to increase our quarterly distribution by at least one and a quarter cents per unit each quarter through 2018. The declaration and payment of distributions is subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, our partnership agreement and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\n\n \u2022 Bobcat Storage Expansion (Phase I and II) - The project as a whole is designed to expand the storage capacity and capabilities of Bobcat Gas Storage facility. Development of Cavern Well 5 increases the working gas capacity to 5.6 Bcf and was placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2015. \n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet cash flows used in investing activities increased $753 million to $1,830 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven mainly by:\n\nIn August 2013, we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Express US and a 100% ownership interest in Express Canada from subsidiaries of Spectra Energy for $410 million in cash and 7.2 million of newly issued common and general partner units. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOperating Revenues. The $186 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 operating costs from Express-Platte, \nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $16 million. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2014, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2015 than in 2014, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $15 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short-term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 Salem Lateral - An expansion of the Algonquin system for delivery of 115 MMcf/d of natural gas to the Footprint Salem Harbor Power Station in Salem, Massachusetts. In-service is scheduled by the second half of 2016. \n \u2022 other non-cash items affecting net income, less \nOperating Revenues. The $92 million increase in operating revenues was driven by:\n \u2022 distributions to noncontrolling interests, and \nWe plan to continue earnings growth by maximizing throughput on all sections of the pipeline systems. This entails connecting, where possible, to rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\n \u2022 $962 million of net issuances of long-term debt in 2015, compared to $441 million of net redemptions in 2014, \nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on successfully maintaining our leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the successful execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued production and the consumption of natural gas and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\n \u2022 a $567 million net increase in commercial paper issuances in 2014 compared to 2013, \n \u2022 higher power costs due to higher usage, net of lower rates on the Express pipeline, partially offset by \nInterest Rate Risk\n \u2022 higher crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on both the Express and Platte pipelines, and \nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2015 \nOur U.S. Transmission business primarily provides transmission and storage of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern United States. Our Liquids business provides transportation of crude oil for customers in central United States and Canada.\nAvailable Credit Facility and Restrictive Debt Covenants\nNatural gas supply dynamics continue to rapidly change, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions\n \u2022 lower project development costs.  Earnings from Equity Investments. The $34 million increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from Sand Hills due to increased volumes and the dropdown of an additional 24.95% ownership interest in SESH in November 2014.\n \u2022 a $103 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by \nRevenue Recognition\n (a) See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts include principal payments and estimated scheduled interest payments over the life of the associated debt. \nThe amounts discussed below are after eliminating intercompany transactions.\n \u2022 a $523 million contribution from parent in 2013, and \nCash Distributions. The partnership agreement requires that, within 60 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our Available Cash, as defined, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date.\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $1,225 million in 2015 compared with $1,004 million in 2014 mainly due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, and higher transportation revenues due to higher tariff rates and volumes on the Express and Platte pipelines. Distributable cash flow was $1,205 million in 2015 compared with $1,055 million in 2014.\n \u2022 net cash paid for income taxes, \nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn August 2013, we issued 7.1 million common units and 0.1 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the acquisition of Express-Platte, valued at $319 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Express-Platte.\nDebt Issuances. On March 12, 2015, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 4.50% senior notes due in 2045. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.\nInterest Expense. The $1 million increase was driven mainly by higher average long-term debt balances, mostly offset by higher capitalized interest due to higher capital spending on expansion projects and lower average interest rates.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $19 million increase due to higher processing revenues mainly due to volumes, and \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $189 million to $1,522 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 changes in working capital.  Investing Cash Flows\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the United States and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nCapital and Investment Expenditures by Business Segment\n \u2022 higher earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased $304 million to $1,333 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $6 million decrease in storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $33 million increase was driven by:\nIncome Tax Expense. The $23 million decrease mainly reflects a 2014 adjustment to deferred income tax liabilities, as a result of the final purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of Express-Platte.\n(a) Tax benefit in 2013 is due to the elimination of deferred income tax liabilities related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\n \u2022 a decrease in gas storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $141 million increase was driven mainly by:\nWe issued 0.6 million common units to the public in 2013 under our at-the-market program, for total net proceeds of $24 million.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\n \u2022 a $224 million increase in proceeds from issuances of units, and \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures.  Distributable Cash Flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Distributable Cash Flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we plan to distribute for a given period.\nOperating Expenses. The $2 million increase was driven by higher direct costs, mostly offset by lower allocated governance costs.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 a $44 million increase due to higher natural gas transportation revenues due to new contracts mainly on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \nDebt Issuances. The following long-term debt issuances were completed during 2013 to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the U.S. Assets Dropdown from Spectra Energy which closed in November 2013:\n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin, and \nOperating Revenues. The $38 million increase in operating revenues was driven by:\nWe project 2016 capital and investment expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion, including $2.4 billion of expansion capital expenditures and $0.3 billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants, pipelines and infrastructure to serve growth. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. Given our objective of growth through acquisitions, we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to acquire assets. Expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities.\nthrough to the last mile of pipe in growing natural gas and crude oil markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements and financings entered into by equity investments. These debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligation in the event of specified declines in credit ratings.\n\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing these growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuances of debt and/or equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, we have access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program.\nSee Matters Affecting Future U.S. Transmission Results for discussions of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 and PHMSA, which are also applicable to the Liquids segment.\nfactors, including, but not limited to, contract renewal rates and cash distributions from our equity investments. The amount of cash distributed to us by our equity investments and the amount of cash we may be required to fund, is determined by our equity investments based on their operating cash flows and other factors as determined by their management. While we participate on the management committees of these equity investments, determination of the amount of distributions and contributions, if any, are not within our control. We received total distributions from equity investments of $610 million in 2015, $294 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of other factors that could affect our cash flows.\n(c) Removes the results of the U.S. Assets Dropdown for the periods prior to the dropdown (January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013) and the results of Express-Platte for the periods prior to the dropdown (March 14, 2013 to August 1, 2013).\nSegment Results\n\n \u2022 a $3 million increase from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $23 million decrease was primarily due to lower AFUDC resulting from decreased capital spending on expansion projects.\nMatters Affecting Future U.S. Transmission Results\nSignificant drivers of variances in Distributable Cash Flow between the periods presented are substantially the same as those previously discussed under Results of Operations. Other drivers include the timing of certain cash outflows, such as capital expenditures for maintenance.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2013\nCommon Unit Issuances. In November 2013, we issued 167.6 million common units and 3.4 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $7.4 billion. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\n \u2022 higher debt balances attributable to a $1.9 billion debt issuance in late September 2013, primarily related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown, and \nThe shift to and increase in natural gas supply have resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher natural gas liquids (NGL) content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the\n \u2022 an $18 million decrease in inventory settlement revenues due to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines.  Operating Expenses. The $7 million increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher ad valorem taxes and power costs.\n \u2022 a $43 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to customers, \nWe define Distributable Cash Flow as EBITDA plus\n_________\n \u2022 a non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, \nWe issued 12 million common units to the public in 2015 under our at-the-market program, and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $557 million, including approximately $11 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\n \u2022 higher allocated governance costs associated with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, and \n2015 Compared to 2014\nSegment EBITDA is summarized in the following table. Detailed discussions follow.\nExpansion capital expenditures included several key projects placed into service in 2015, including:\n \u2022 Gulf Market Expansion - This Texas Eastern system expansion project connects growth markets (Gulf Coast LNG and industrials) with diverse, growing shale supply. The project consists of installing reverse-compression capability at six compressor stations to provide up to 650 MMcf/d. The project will be executed in two phases. Phase 1, due to go in-service in the second half of 2016, will provide north to south compression at five stations. Phase 2, due to go in-service in the second half of 2017, will provide north to south compression at one station and new compression at one existing compressor station and one new compressor stations. \n \u2022 higher crude oil transportation revenues for both Express and Platte pipelines mainly as a result of increased tariff rates and higher revenue volumes, and \n \u2022 a $26 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues for both Express and Platte pipelines, as a result of increased tariff rates and higher revenue volumes.  Operating Expenses. The $25 million increase in operating expenses was attributable mainly to the acquisition of Express-Platte.\nAs a result of our ongoing strong earnings performance expected in existing operations, we expect to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. We will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nFor a more detailed discussion of earnings drivers, see the segment discussions that follow.\n2014 Compared to 2013\ndeposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage and gathering services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on an evaluation by Spectra Energy), or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\n(b) Data includes activity since March 14, 2013, the date of the acquisition of Express-Platte by Spectra Energy.\n\u2022Effectively executing the projects we have secured.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as Total Current Liabilities on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet other than Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt. It is expected that the majority of Total Current Liabilities will be paid in cash in 2016.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas transmitted and gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect gathering revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transmission and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire.\n \u2022 a $766 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures.  Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased $2,612 million to $1,077 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This decrease was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 a $54 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on both the Express and Platte pipelines, partially offset by \n________\nRegulatory Accounting\n \u2022 a $7 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to customers, and \nIn April 2013, we issued 5.2 million common units to the public and 0.1 million general partner units. Total net proceeds were $193 million. The net proceeds from this issuance were temporarily invested in restricted available-for-sale securities until the Express-Platte dropdown, at which time the funds were partially used to pay for a portion of the transaction. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Express-Platte transaction.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills. Results presented herein include Express-Platte since March 14, 2013, the date of Spectra Energy's acquisition, and Sand Hills and Southern Hills through October 30, 2015, the date of Spectra Energy's acquisition.\nInterest Expense. The $145 million decrease was driven mainly by:\n2014 Compared to 2013\n\nRevenues from the transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas, and from the transportation of crude oil are recognized when the service is provided. Revenues related to these services provided but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern United States-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental United States average growth rates through 2019. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector and other new industrial gas demands, including LNG. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore. The national supply profile is shifting to new sources of gas from natural gas shale basins in the Rockies, Midcontinent, Appalachia, Texas and Louisiana. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we will pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent community and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from the natural gas shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S., these pressures could increase costs and/or cause a slowdown in the production of natural gas from these basins, and therefore, could negatively affect our growth plans.\n \u2022 SESH Dentville - Installation of a single compressor located near the SESH/Texas Eastern Interconnect to maintain deliveries from Texas Eastern into SESH with changing pressure profile on Texas Eastern due to mainline expansion projects. This project has an additional capacity range of 474 MMcf/d max, 102.2 MMcf/d min. The project was placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2015.  Significant 2016 expansion projects expenditures are expected to include:\nLiquids\n\u2022Building off the strength of our asset base.\nDistributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to Net Income, Operating Income, cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. Distributable Cash Flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect Net Income and Operating Income and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Distributable Cash Flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of $927 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $476 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $283 million, and a payable to an equity investment of $148 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity affiliates, and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. We have access to a revolving credit facility, with available capacity of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. This facility is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program, which is used to manage working capital requirements and for temporary funding of capital expenditures. We expect to be self-funding and plan to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years. Capital resources may continue to include commercial paper, short-term borrowings under our current credit facility and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity.\n \u2022 a $168 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nFor further information related to management's assessment of our risk factors, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn November 2014, we completed the second of the three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. This transaction consisted of acquiring an additional 24.95% ownership interest in SESH and the remaining 1% ownership interest in Steckman Ridge. Total consideration was approximately 4.3 million newly issued common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nAs noted above, the terms of the credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to- Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreements, of 5.0 to 1 or less. As of December 31, 2015 this ratio was 3.6 to 1.\nMatters Affecting Future Liquids Results\n \u2022 Uniontown to Gas City - The project provides shippers with 425 MMcf/d of firm transportation service from the supply-rich area west of Uniontown, Pennsylvania to a new delivery meter with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line near Gas City, Indiana for further redelivery to markets in the Midwest. Five shippers combine to contract for the full 425 MMcf/d of capacity under the project. The project was placed in-service during the third quarter of 2015. \n\u2022Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments.\n \u2022 expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nOperating Cash Flows\n_________\nWe performed either a quantitative assessment or a qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill as of April 1, 2015 (our annual testing date). Based on that assessment, we determined that this condition, for each reporting unit, does not exist. As such, performing the first step of the two-step impairment test for these units was unnecessary. No triggering events occurred during the period from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 that warranted re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nOTHER ISSUES\nCommon Unit Issuances. On November 4, 2015, we issued 17,114 common units in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $1 million. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, \nWe plan to continue earnings growth through capital efficient projects, such as transportation and storage expansion to support a two-pronged supply push\u201d / market pull\u201d strategy, as well as continued focus on optimizing the performance of the existing operations through organizational efficiencies and cost control. Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport specified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\n \u2022 Sabal Trail - A 1,100 MMcf/d of new capacity to access onshore shale gas supplies. Facilities include a new 465-mile pipeline, laterals and various compressor stations. This project is expected to be in-service by the first half of 2017. \nOperating Revenues. The $304 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $117 million increase in proceeds from issuances of units in connection with our at-the-market program in 2014.  Significant Financing Activities-2015\n \u2022 Algonquin Incremental Market (AIM) - A 342 MMcf/d expansion of the Algonquin system consisting of replacement pipeline, new pipeline, new and modified meter station facilities and additional compression at existing stations. The project is designed to transport gas from existing interconnects in New Jersey and New York to LDC markets in the northeast. In-service is scheduled by the second half of 2016. \n \u2022 Loudon Expansion - This project will provide a customer with 40,000 decatherms per day (Dth/d) of incremental capacity. The project is expected to be in-service during the second half of 2016. \nIn November 2013, we completed the closing of substantially all of the U.S. Assets Dropdown, including Spectra Energy's remaining 60% interest in the U.S. portion of Express-Platte. We paid Spectra Energy aggregate consideration with the issuance of approximately 171.1 million newly issued partnership units and $2.3 billion in cash. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states with growing connectivity to the Gulf Coast of the United States. Growth in our business is dependent on growing crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to compete with imported crude oil from overseas. While the recent decline in crude oil prices has not adversely affected our existing crude oil pipeline business, it does adversely affect producers' ability to grow or even sustain current production. While we do expect oil prices to recover, the current low price environment will challenge the economic viability or need for any new significant infrastructure. As global demand for crude oil grows and with the ability to export crude, we do expect growth potential in North American to return. Sustained low oil prices could eventually have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\n \u2022 Ozark Conversion - The project includes abandonment of portions of the Ozark Gas Transmission system from natural gas service and leasing of the abandoned lines to Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to transport approximately 75,000 barrels per day of refined products. Completion of Spectra's scope of work occurred during the third quarter of 2015. Completion of Magellan's scope of work and system in-service is expected during the first half of 2016. \n \u2022 a $71 million loan to an equity investment in 2013, and \nIn 2014, we issued 6.4 million common units to the public under our at-the-market program and 132,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $334 million, including $7 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash\n2014 Compared to 2013\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\n (a) Excludes the $2,210 million net cash outlay for the U.S. Assets Dropdown in 2013. \nOn November 4, 2015, we acquired the remaining 0.1% ownership interest in SESH from Spectra Energy. Total consideration was 17,114 newly issued common units. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. This is the last of three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDistributable Cash Flow is the primary financial measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements to assess the amount of cash that is available for distribution. The effects of the U.S. Assets Dropdown and the Express-Platte acquisition have been excluded from the Distributable Cash Flow calculation for periods prior to the dropdown transactions in order to reflect the true amount of the cash that was available for distribution.\nOperating Expenses. The $37 million increase was driven by higher allocated governance costs associated with the assets in the U.S. Assets Dropdown, which was effective on November 1, 2013, partially offset by related transaction costs.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nOther\n \u2022 a $21 million decrease in ad valorem tax accruals, and \nWe are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and credit exposure. We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Spectra Energy is responsible for the overall governance of managing our interest rate risk and credit risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\n_________\n \u2022 lower inventory settlement revenues due to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines, \nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil and/or natural gas, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\n\u2022Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any customer.\n\u2022Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service.\n \u2022 lower storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $49 million increase was driven mainly by:\nOperating Revenues. The $148 million increase was driven by:\n2015 Compared to 2014\nWe invested $2.0 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2015, including $1.7 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $2.4 billion planned for 2016, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity investments, and various financing transactions, which may include issuances of short-term and long-term debt, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly unit issuances. We expect to maintain an investment-grade capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. Therefore, we will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity, and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\n \u2022 Ohio Pipeline Energy Network (OPEN) - A 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) expansion of the Texas Eastern pipeline system consisting of new pipeline, a new compressor station and other associated facility upgrades. The project is designed to transport gas produced in the Utica Shale and Marcellus Shale to U.S. markets in the Midwest, Southeast and Gulf Coast. This project was placed in-service during the third quarter of 2015. \nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas and crude oil infrastructure to premium markets. We will grow our business through organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\n \u2022 higher depreciation on Express-Platte and expansion projects.  Earnings from Equity Investments. The $44 million increase was mostly attributable to higher earnings due to the continued ramp up of volumes on Sand Hills and Southern Hills.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n (b) See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \u2022 increased natural gas transportation revenues due to new contracts mainly on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \nEBITDA by Business Segment\nassess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required to be recognized. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $326 million as of December 31, 2015 and $290 million as of December 31, 2014. Total regulatory liabilities were $25 million as of December 31, 2015 and $29 million as of December 31, 2014.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills. In consideration for this transaction, we retired 21,560,000 of our common units and 440,000 of our general partner units held by Spectra Energy, which will result in the reduction of any associated distribution payable to Spectra Energy, beginning in 2016. There will also be a reduction in the aggregate quarterly distributions, if any, to Spectra Energy, (as holder of incentive distribution rights), by $4 million per quarter for a period of 12 consecutive quarters commencing with the quarter ending on December 31, 2015 and ending with the quarter ending on September 30, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n \u2022 a $33 million increase from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \n \u2022 distributions from equity investments, \n \u2022 a $9 million increase due to a non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, and \nOperating Revenues. The $212 million increase was driven by:\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n \u2022 interest expense, \nThe Express-Platte acquisition and the U.S. Assets Dropdown have been accounted for as acquisitions under common control, resulting in the recast of our prior results, excluding distributable cash flow. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions.\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion.\nOur Board of Directors evaluates each individual quarterly distribution decision based on an assessment of growth in cash available to make distributions. Growth in our cash available to make distributions over time is dependent on incremental organic growth expansion, third-party acquisitions or acquisitions from Spectra Energy. Our amount of Available Cash depends primarily upon our cash flows, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record a net loss for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities. Significant cost increases could negatively affect the returns ultimately earned on current and future expansions.\nCredit Risk\n\n\n(a) Thousand barrels per day.\n \u2022 higher electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \nWe increased the quarterly cash distributions each quarter of 2015 from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $0.63875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2015. The cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 was declared on February 3, 2016 and is payable on February 26, 2016.\nFinancing Cash Flows\n \u2022 a $146 million increase in distributions to partners.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $237 million in 2014 compared to $2,733 million provided by financing activities in 2013. This $2,970 million change was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 higher operating costs, and \nOther Financing Matters. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of limited partner common units and various debt securities and another registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of $1 billion, in the aggregate, of limited partner common units and various debt securities over time. This registration statement has $944 million available as of December 31, 2015.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate offsite impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.", "item_7_text": "EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n \u2022 lower ad valorem tax accruals, \nOther Income and Expenses. The $41 million increase was primarily due to higher earnings from the continued ramp up of volumes on Sand Hills and Southern Hills.\n \u2022 a $122 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interest in 2014, and \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had interest rate hedges in place for various purposes. We are party to pay floating-receive fixed\u201d interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.\nWe had goodwill balances of $3,232 million at December 31, 2015 and $3,244 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in goodwill in 2015 was the result of foreign currency translation. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash flows from operations are fairly stable given that substantially all of our revenues and those of our equity investments are derived from operations under firm contracts. However, total operating cash flows are subject to a number of\n \u2022 lower capitalized interest resulting from projects placed in service in 2013.  Income Tax Expense. The $383 million increase was mainly due to the elimination of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of the U.S. Assets Dropdown and resulting changes in tax status of certain entities in 2013.\nThe credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the agreements. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, the credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of us or of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nCapital expansion projects are developed and executed using results-proven project management processes. We evaluate the strategic fit and commercial and execution risks, and continuously measure performance compared to plan. Ongoing communications between project teams and senior leadership ensure we maintain the right focus and deliver the expected results. We expect that significant natural gas infrastructure, including both natural gas transportation and storage with links to growing gas supplies and markets, will be needed over time to serve growth in gas-fired power generation, oil-to-gas conversions, industrial development and attachments to new gas supply.\n \u2022 a $22 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower prices, net of higher volumes, \n \u2022 a $58 million decrease in capital and investment expenditures in 2014. Capital and investment expenditures in 2014 included a $94 million investment in SESH, used by SESH to retire debt, partially offset by \nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Distributable Cash Flow\u201d\n \u2022 $141 million of net proceeds from available-for-sale securities in 2013. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \u2022 a $43 million increase in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to customers, partially offset by \n (c) Excludes the $343 million net cash outlay for the acquisition of Express-Platte in 2013.  Capital and investment expenditures for 2015 totaled $2,007 million and included $1,693 million for expansion projects, and $314 million for maintenance and other projects.\n (b) Excludes a $71 million loan to an equity investment in 2013. \n \u2022 $431 million of net redemptions of commercial paper in 2015, compared to $569 million of net issuances in 2014 \nCredit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Our exposure generally relates to receivables and unbilled revenue for services provided, as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by us generally under park and loan services and no-notice services. Our principal customers for natural gas transmission and storage services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the United States. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the United States. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. We have concentrations of receivables from these industry sectors. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively affect the credit quality of the entire sector.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2014\n \u2022 lower processing revenues primarily due to lower prices, net of higher volumes, \n \u2022 Express Enhancement - This project will increase system capacity by 21,000 barrels per day. Facilities include the addition of tank storage at Hardisty, AB and Buffalo, MT and additional pumps at Buffalo, MT. The project is expected to be in-service during the second half of 2016. \n \u2022 a $68 million increase primarily due to the acquisition of Express-Platte, and \nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\n \u2022 a $549 million increase in distributions to partners in 2014, \nOther Income and Expenses. The $12 million increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Sand Hills due to increased volumes, partially offset by the disposition of Sand Hills and Southern Hills on October 30, 2015.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the U.S. Department of Transportation. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nIn March 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common units up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, and in December 2015 we replaced the equity distribution agreement. The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in our previous agreements and allow us to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows us to offer and sell common units at prices deemed appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between the sales agent and us.\nOur businesses in the United States and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $336 million in 2015 compared to $237 million used in financing activities in 2014. This $573 million change was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 higher processing revenues mainly due to volumes, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $10 million increase in operating costs mostly due to repairs and maintenance, \nOther Income and Expenses, Net. The $45 million increase was mainly attributable to higher allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) from higher capital spending on expansion projects.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nU.S. Transmission \n \u2022 a $5 million decrease from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $69 million increase was mainly due to higher AFUDC from higher capital spending on expansion projects and higher equity earnings mainly due to the dropdown of an additional 24.95% interest in SESH in November 2014.\nThe issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amount available under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nseasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively impacting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on EBITDA transactions. Cash, cash equivalents and investments are managed centrally, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income, are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its continuing operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nCrude oil supply dynamics continue to evolve as North American oil production has shifted from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production has displaced more expensive imports from overseas which drove increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices have resulted in declining North American oil production at this time, lower prices are also stimulating new demand which will also show up over the next couple years. This natural cycle along with the realization of significant crude oil resources in North America which has enabled the removal of the crude oil export ban allows us to remain confident about prospects for long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future opportunities to grow our crude oil pipeline business.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nAs permitted under the accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\n \u2022 higher recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $25 million decrease in gas storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $53 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 the restructuring of an intercompany loan contributed to us as part of the U.S. Assets Dropdown, partially offset by \n \u2022 lower natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin, and \n (c) Purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nCommon Unit Issuances. In November 2014, we issued 4.3 million common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $186 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.\n \u2022 an $80 million increase in distributions received from equity investments in 2014, comprised mostly of a $99 million distribution from SESH with proceeds from a SESH debt offering, \n(b) Excludes $403 million, $129 million, and $63 million of distributions from equity investments for the 2015, 2014, and 2013 periods, respectively.\nOther Income and Expenses. The $28 million decrease was mainly attributable to lower AFUDC resulting from decreased capital spending on expansion projects.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n \u2022 a $137 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, and \n \u2022 $441 million of net redemptions of long-term debt in 2014 compared to $2,241 million of net issuances in 2013, which were mostly used to fund the U.S. Assets Dropdown, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher earnings in 2014, after adjusting for non-cash items primarily consisting of a $381 million change in deferred income taxes, partially offset by \n \u2022 an $8 million increase in operating costs, net of employee benefit costs, partially offset by \n \u2022 lower employee benefit costs, and \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTerm Loan Agreement. In November 2013, we entered into and borrowed $400 million under a senior unsecured five-year term loan agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowing was used to pay Spectra Energy for the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\nFor information on other issues, see Notes 5 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 a $7 million increase in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 the acquisition of Express-Platte in March 2013, \n \u2022 a $2,210 million net cash outlay for the U.S. Assets Dropdown in 2013,  \u2022a $343 million net cash outlay for the acquisition of Express-Platte in 2013,\n \u2022 earnings from equity investments, \n \u2022 equity AFUDC, \n2014 Compared to 2013\nWe increased our quarterly cash distribution each quarter in 2015, from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 which was paid in February 2015, to $0.63875 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 which is payable on February 26, 2016. We intend to increase our quarterly distribution by at least one and a quarter cents per unit each quarter through 2018. The declaration and payment of distributions is subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, our partnership agreement and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\n\n \u2022 Bobcat Storage Expansion (Phase I and II) - The project as a whole is designed to expand the storage capacity and capabilities of Bobcat Gas Storage facility. Development of Cavern Well 5 increases the working gas capacity to 5.6 Bcf and was placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2015. \n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet cash flows used in investing activities increased $753 million to $1,830 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven mainly by:\n\nIn August 2013, we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Express US and a 100% ownership interest in Express Canada from subsidiaries of Spectra Energy for $410 million in cash and 7.2 million of newly issued common and general partner units. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOperating Revenues. The $186 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 operating costs from Express-Platte, \nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $16 million. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2014, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2015 than in 2014, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $15 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short-term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 Salem Lateral - An expansion of the Algonquin system for delivery of 115 MMcf/d of natural gas to the Footprint Salem Harbor Power Station in Salem, Massachusetts. In-service is scheduled by the second half of 2016. \n \u2022 other non-cash items affecting net income, less \nOperating Revenues. The $92 million increase in operating revenues was driven by:\n \u2022 distributions to noncontrolling interests, and \nWe plan to continue earnings growth by maximizing throughput on all sections of the pipeline systems. This entails connecting, where possible, to rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\n \u2022 $962 million of net issuances of long-term debt in 2015, compared to $441 million of net redemptions in 2014, \nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on successfully maintaining our leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the successful execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued production and the consumption of natural gas and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\n \u2022 a $567 million net increase in commercial paper issuances in 2014 compared to 2013, \n \u2022 higher power costs due to higher usage, net of lower rates on the Express pipeline, partially offset by \nInterest Rate Risk\n \u2022 higher crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on both the Express and Platte pipelines, and \nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2015 \nOur U.S. Transmission business primarily provides transmission and storage of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern United States. Our Liquids business provides transportation of crude oil for customers in central United States and Canada.\nAvailable Credit Facility and Restrictive Debt Covenants\nNatural gas supply dynamics continue to rapidly change, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions\n \u2022 lower project development costs.  Earnings from Equity Investments. The $34 million increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from Sand Hills due to increased volumes and the dropdown of an additional 24.95% ownership interest in SESH in November 2014.\n \u2022 a $103 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by \nRevenue Recognition\n (a) See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts include principal payments and estimated scheduled interest payments over the life of the associated debt. \nThe amounts discussed below are after eliminating intercompany transactions.\n \u2022 a $523 million contribution from parent in 2013, and \nCash Distributions. The partnership agreement requires that, within 60 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our Available Cash, as defined, to unitholders of record on the applicable record date.\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $1,225 million in 2015 compared with $1,004 million in 2014 mainly due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, and higher transportation revenues due to higher tariff rates and volumes on the Express and Platte pipelines. Distributable cash flow was $1,205 million in 2015 compared with $1,055 million in 2014.\n \u2022 net cash paid for income taxes, \nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn August 2013, we issued 7.1 million common units and 0.1 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the acquisition of Express-Platte, valued at $319 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Express-Platte.\nDebt Issuances. On March 12, 2015, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 4.50% senior notes due in 2045. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.\nInterest Expense. The $1 million increase was driven mainly by higher average long-term debt balances, mostly offset by higher capitalized interest due to higher capital spending on expansion projects and lower average interest rates.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 a $19 million increase due to higher processing revenues mainly due to volumes, and \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $189 million to $1,522 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 changes in working capital.  Investing Cash Flows\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the United States and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nCapital and Investment Expenditures by Business Segment\n \u2022 higher earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased $304 million to $1,333 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was driven primarily by:\n \u2022 a $6 million decrease in storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $33 million increase was driven by:\nIncome Tax Expense. The $23 million decrease mainly reflects a 2014 adjustment to deferred income tax liabilities, as a result of the final purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of Express-Platte.\n(a) Tax benefit in 2013 is due to the elimination of deferred income tax liabilities related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\n \u2022 a decrease in gas storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $141 million increase was driven mainly by:\nWe issued 0.6 million common units to the public in 2013 under our at-the-market program, for total net proceeds of $24 million.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\n \u2022 a $224 million increase in proceeds from issuances of units, and \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures.  Distributable Cash Flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Distributable Cash Flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we plan to distribute for a given period.\nOperating Expenses. The $2 million increase was driven by higher direct costs, mostly offset by lower allocated governance costs.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 a $44 million increase due to higher natural gas transportation revenues due to new contracts mainly on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \nDebt Issuances. The following long-term debt issuances were completed during 2013 to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the U.S. Assets Dropdown from Spectra Energy which closed in November 2013:\n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin, and \nOperating Revenues. The $38 million increase in operating revenues was driven by:\nWe project 2016 capital and investment expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion, including $2.4 billion of expansion capital expenditures and $0.3 billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants, pipelines and infrastructure to serve growth. These projections exclude contributions from noncontrolling interests. Given our objective of growth through acquisitions, we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to acquire assets. Expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities.\nthrough to the last mile of pipe in growing natural gas and crude oil markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements and financings entered into by equity investments. These debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligation in the event of specified declines in credit ratings.\n\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing these growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuances of debt and/or equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, we have access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program.\nSee Matters Affecting Future U.S. Transmission Results for discussions of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 and PHMSA, which are also applicable to the Liquids segment.\nfactors, including, but not limited to, contract renewal rates and cash distributions from our equity investments. The amount of cash distributed to us by our equity investments and the amount of cash we may be required to fund, is determined by our equity investments based on their operating cash flows and other factors as determined by their management. While we participate on the management committees of these equity investments, determination of the amount of distributions and contributions, if any, are not within our control. We received total distributions from equity investments of $610 million in 2015, $294 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of other factors that could affect our cash flows.\n(c) Removes the results of the U.S. Assets Dropdown for the periods prior to the dropdown (January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013) and the results of Express-Platte for the periods prior to the dropdown (March 14, 2013 to August 1, 2013).\nSegment Results\n\n \u2022 a $3 million increase from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $23 million decrease was primarily due to lower AFUDC resulting from decreased capital spending on expansion projects.\nMatters Affecting Future U.S. Transmission Results\nSignificant drivers of variances in Distributable Cash Flow between the periods presented are substantially the same as those previously discussed under Results of Operations. Other drivers include the timing of certain cash outflows, such as capital expenditures for maintenance.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2013\nCommon Unit Issuances. In November 2013, we issued 167.6 million common units and 3.4 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $7.4 billion. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the U.S. Assets Dropdown.\n \u2022 higher debt balances attributable to a $1.9 billion debt issuance in late September 2013, primarily related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown, and \nThe shift to and increase in natural gas supply have resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher natural gas liquids (NGL) content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the\n \u2022 an $18 million decrease in inventory settlement revenues due to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines.  Operating Expenses. The $7 million increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher ad valorem taxes and power costs.\n \u2022 a $43 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to customers, \nWe define Distributable Cash Flow as EBITDA plus\n_________\n \u2022 a non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, \nWe issued 12 million common units to the public in 2015 under our at-the-market program, and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $557 million, including approximately $11 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, \"wet\" gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in \"dry\" fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to further possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and possible impairment of our storage assets.\n \u2022 higher allocated governance costs associated with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, and \n2015 Compared to 2014\nSegment EBITDA is summarized in the following table. Detailed discussions follow.\nExpansion capital expenditures included several key projects placed into service in 2015, including:\n \u2022 Gulf Market Expansion - This Texas Eastern system expansion project connects growth markets (Gulf Coast LNG and industrials) with diverse, growing shale supply. The project consists of installing reverse-compression capability at six compressor stations to provide up to 650 MMcf/d. The project will be executed in two phases. Phase 1, due to go in-service in the second half of 2016, will provide north to south compression at five stations. Phase 2, due to go in-service in the second half of 2017, will provide north to south compression at one station and new compression at one existing compressor station and one new compressor stations. \n \u2022 higher crude oil transportation revenues for both Express and Platte pipelines mainly as a result of increased tariff rates and higher revenue volumes, and \n \u2022 a $26 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues for both Express and Platte pipelines, as a result of increased tariff rates and higher revenue volumes.  Operating Expenses. The $25 million increase in operating expenses was attributable mainly to the acquisition of Express-Platte.\nAs a result of our ongoing strong earnings performance expected in existing operations, we expect to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. We will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nFor a more detailed discussion of earnings drivers, see the segment discussions that follow.\n2014 Compared to 2013\ndeposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage and gathering services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on an evaluation by Spectra Energy), or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\n(b) Data includes activity since March 14, 2013, the date of the acquisition of Express-Platte by Spectra Energy.\n\u2022Effectively executing the projects we have secured.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as Total Current Liabilities on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet other than Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt. It is expected that the majority of Total Current Liabilities will be paid in cash in 2016.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas transmitted and gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect gathering revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transmission and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire.\n \u2022 a $766 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures.  Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased $2,612 million to $1,077 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This decrease was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 a $54 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on both the Express and Platte pipelines, partially offset by \n________\nRegulatory Accounting\n \u2022 a $7 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to customers, and \nIn April 2013, we issued 5.2 million common units to the public and 0.1 million general partner units. Total net proceeds were $193 million. The net proceeds from this issuance were temporarily invested in restricted available-for-sale securities until the Express-Platte dropdown, at which time the funds were partially used to pay for a portion of the transaction. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Express-Platte transaction.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills. Results presented herein include Express-Platte since March 14, 2013, the date of Spectra Energy's acquisition, and Sand Hills and Southern Hills through October 30, 2015, the date of Spectra Energy's acquisition.\nInterest Expense. The $145 million decrease was driven mainly by:\n2014 Compared to 2013\n\nRevenues from the transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas, and from the transportation of crude oil are recognized when the service is provided. Revenues related to these services provided but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern United States-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental United States average growth rates through 2019. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector and other new industrial gas demands, including LNG. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore. The national supply profile is shifting to new sources of gas from natural gas shale basins in the Rockies, Midcontinent, Appalachia, Texas and Louisiana. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we will pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent community and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from the natural gas shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S., these pressures could increase costs and/or cause a slowdown in the production of natural gas from these basins, and therefore, could negatively affect our growth plans.\n \u2022 SESH Dentville - Installation of a single compressor located near the SESH/Texas Eastern Interconnect to maintain deliveries from Texas Eastern into SESH with changing pressure profile on Texas Eastern due to mainline expansion projects. This project has an additional capacity range of 474 MMcf/d max, 102.2 MMcf/d min. The project was placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2015.  Significant 2016 expansion projects expenditures are expected to include:\nLiquids\n\u2022Building off the strength of our asset base.\nDistributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to Net Income, Operating Income, cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. Distributable Cash Flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect Net Income and Operating Income and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Distributable Cash Flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of $927 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $476 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $283 million, and a payable to an equity investment of $148 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity affiliates, and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. We have access to a revolving credit facility, with available capacity of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. This facility is used principally as a back-stop for our commercial paper program, which is used to manage working capital requirements and for temporary funding of capital expenditures. We expect to be self-funding and plan to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years. Capital resources may continue to include commercial paper, short-term borrowings under our current credit facility and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity.\n \u2022 a $168 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nFor further information related to management's assessment of our risk factors, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn November 2014, we completed the second of the three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. This transaction consisted of acquiring an additional 24.95% ownership interest in SESH and the remaining 1% ownership interest in Steckman Ridge. Total consideration was approximately 4.3 million newly issued common units and 86,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nAs noted above, the terms of the credit agreements require us to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to- Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreements, of 5.0 to 1 or less. As of December 31, 2015 this ratio was 3.6 to 1.\nMatters Affecting Future Liquids Results\n \u2022 Uniontown to Gas City - The project provides shippers with 425 MMcf/d of firm transportation service from the supply-rich area west of Uniontown, Pennsylvania to a new delivery meter with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line near Gas City, Indiana for further redelivery to markets in the Midwest. Five shippers combine to contract for the full 425 MMcf/d of capacity under the project. The project was placed in-service during the third quarter of 2015. \n\u2022Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments.\n \u2022 expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \nOperating Cash Flows\n_________\nWe performed either a quantitative assessment or a qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units are less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill as of April 1, 2015 (our annual testing date). Based on that assessment, we determined that this condition, for each reporting unit, does not exist. As such, performing the first step of the two-step impairment test for these units was unnecessary. No triggering events occurred during the period from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 that warranted re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nOTHER ISSUES\nCommon Unit Issuances. On November 4, 2015, we issued 17,114 common units in connection with the U.S. Assets Dropdown, valued at $1 million. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, \nWe plan to continue earnings growth through capital efficient projects, such as transportation and storage expansion to support a two-pronged supply push\u201d / market pull\u201d strategy, as well as continued focus on optimizing the performance of the existing operations through organizational efficiencies and cost control. Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport specified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\n \u2022 Sabal Trail - A 1,100 MMcf/d of new capacity to access onshore shale gas supplies. Facilities include a new 465-mile pipeline, laterals and various compressor stations. This project is expected to be in-service by the first half of 2017. \nOperating Revenues. The $304 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $117 million increase in proceeds from issuances of units in connection with our at-the-market program in 2014.  Significant Financing Activities-2015\n \u2022 Algonquin Incremental Market (AIM) - A 342 MMcf/d expansion of the Algonquin system consisting of replacement pipeline, new pipeline, new and modified meter station facilities and additional compression at existing stations. The project is designed to transport gas from existing interconnects in New Jersey and New York to LDC markets in the northeast. In-service is scheduled by the second half of 2016. \n \u2022 Loudon Expansion - This project will provide a customer with 40,000 decatherms per day (Dth/d) of incremental capacity. The project is expected to be in-service during the second half of 2016. \nIn November 2013, we completed the closing of substantially all of the U.S. Assets Dropdown, including Spectra Energy's remaining 60% interest in the U.S. portion of Express-Platte. We paid Spectra Energy aggregate consideration with the issuance of approximately 171.1 million newly issued partnership units and $2.3 billion in cash. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states with growing connectivity to the Gulf Coast of the United States. Growth in our business is dependent on growing crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to compete with imported crude oil from overseas. While the recent decline in crude oil prices has not adversely affected our existing crude oil pipeline business, it does adversely affect producers' ability to grow or even sustain current production. While we do expect oil prices to recover, the current low price environment will challenge the economic viability or need for any new significant infrastructure. As global demand for crude oil grows and with the ability to export crude, we do expect growth potential in North American to return. Sustained low oil prices could eventually have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\n \u2022 Ozark Conversion - The project includes abandonment of portions of the Ozark Gas Transmission system from natural gas service and leasing of the abandoned lines to Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to transport approximately 75,000 barrels per day of refined products. Completion of Spectra's scope of work occurred during the third quarter of 2015. Completion of Magellan's scope of work and system in-service is expected during the first half of 2016. \n \u2022 a $71 million loan to an equity investment in 2013, and \nIn 2014, we issued 6.4 million common units to the public under our at-the-market program and 132,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds were $334 million, including $7 million of proceeds from Spectra Energy.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash\n2014 Compared to 2013\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\n (a) Excludes the $2,210 million net cash outlay for the U.S. Assets Dropdown in 2013. \nOn November 4, 2015, we acquired the remaining 0.1% ownership interest in SESH from Spectra Energy. Total consideration was 17,114 newly issued common units. In addition, we issued 342 general partner units to Spectra Energy in exchange for the same amount of common units in order to maintain Spectra Energy's 2% general partner interest. This is the last of three planned transactions related to the U.S. Assets Dropdown. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nDistributable Cash Flow is the primary financial measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements to assess the amount of cash that is available for distribution. The effects of the U.S. Assets Dropdown and the Express-Platte acquisition have been excluded from the Distributable Cash Flow calculation for periods prior to the dropdown transactions in order to reflect the true amount of the cash that was available for distribution.\nOperating Expenses. The $37 million increase was driven by higher allocated governance costs associated with the assets in the U.S. Assets Dropdown, which was effective on November 1, 2013, partially offset by related transaction costs.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nOther\n \u2022 a $21 million decrease in ad valorem tax accruals, and \nWe are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and credit exposure. We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Spectra Energy is responsible for the overall governance of managing our interest rate risk and credit risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\n_________\n \u2022 lower inventory settlement revenues due to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines, \nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil and/or natural gas, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\n\u2022Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any customer.\n\u2022Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service.\n \u2022 lower storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating Expenses. The $49 million increase was driven mainly by:\nOperating Revenues. The $148 million increase was driven by:\n2015 Compared to 2014\nWe invested $2.0 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2015, including $1.7 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $2.4 billion planned for 2016, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. We will rely upon cash flows from operations, including cash distributions received from our equity investments, and various financing transactions, which may include issuances of short-term and long-term debt, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2016. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion opportunities over the next several years, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly unit issuances. We expect to maintain an investment-grade capital structure and liquidity profile that supports our strategic objectives. Therefore, we will continue to monitor market requirements and our liquidity, and make adjustments to these plans, as needed.\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\n \u2022 Ohio Pipeline Energy Network (OPEN) - A 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) expansion of the Texas Eastern pipeline system consisting of new pipeline, a new compressor station and other associated facility upgrades. The project is designed to transport gas produced in the Utica Shale and Marcellus Shale to U.S. markets in the Midwest, Southeast and Gulf Coast. This project was placed in-service during the third quarter of 2015. \nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas and crude oil infrastructure to premium markets. We will grow our business through organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\n \u2022 higher depreciation on Express-Platte and expansion projects.  Earnings from Equity Investments. The $44 million increase was mostly attributable to higher earnings due to the continued ramp up of volumes on Sand Hills and Southern Hills.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n (b) See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \u2022 increased natural gas transportation revenues due to new contracts mainly on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \nEBITDA by Business Segment\nassess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required to be recognized. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $326 million as of December 31, 2015 and $290 million as of December 31, 2014. Total regulatory liabilities were $25 million as of December 31, 2015 and $29 million as of December 31, 2014.\nOn October 30, 2015, Spectra Energy acquired our 33.3% ownership interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills. In consideration for this transaction, we retired 21,560,000 of our common units and 440,000 of our general partner units held by Spectra Energy, which will result in the reduction of any associated distribution payable to Spectra Energy, beginning in 2016. There will also be a reduction in the aggregate quarterly distributions, if any, to Spectra Energy, (as holder of incentive distribution rights), by $4 million per quarter for a period of 12 consecutive quarters commencing with the quarter ending on December 31, 2015 and ending with the quarter ending on September 30, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n \u2022 a $33 million increase from expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern, \n \u2022 distributions from equity investments, \n \u2022 a $9 million increase due to a non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, and \nOperating Revenues. The $212 million increase was driven by:\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n \u2022 interest expense, \nThe Express-Platte acquisition and the U.S. Assets Dropdown have been accounted for as acquisitions under common control, resulting in the recast of our prior results, excluding distributable cash flow. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions.\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion.\nOur Board of Directors evaluates each individual quarterly distribution decision based on an assessment of growth in cash available to make distributions. Growth in our cash available to make distributions over time is dependent on incremental organic growth expansion, third-party acquisitions or acquisitions from Spectra Energy. Our amount of Available Cash depends primarily upon our cash flows, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record a net loss for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities. Significant cost increases could negatively affect the returns ultimately earned on current and future expansions.\nCredit Risk\n\n\n(a) Thousand barrels per day.\n \u2022 higher electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \nWe increased the quarterly cash distributions each quarter of 2015 from $0.58875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $0.63875 per limited partner unit for the fourth quarter of 2015. The cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 was declared on February 3, 2016 and is payable on February 26, 2016.\nFinancing Cash Flows\n \u2022 a $146 million increase in distributions to partners.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $237 million in 2014 compared to $2,733 million provided by financing activities in 2013. This $2,970 million change was driven mainly by:\n \u2022 higher operating costs, and \nOther Financing Matters. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of limited partner common units and various debt securities and another registration statement on file with the SEC to register the issuance of $1 billion, in the aggregate, of limited partner common units and various debt securities over time. This registration statement has $944 million available as of December 31, 2015.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties.
