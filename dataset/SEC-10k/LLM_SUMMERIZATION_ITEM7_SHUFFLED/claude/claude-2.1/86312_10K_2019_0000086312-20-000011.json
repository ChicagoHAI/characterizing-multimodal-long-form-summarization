of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings). Total income tax expense for 2017 included a net charge of $129 million to reflect the estimated impact of the changes in tax law and tax rates included in TCJA at the date of enactment, primarily reflecting the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory federal tax rate of 21%, and the recognition of tax imposed on the accumulated foreign earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following discussions of the Company's net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.\nOverview\nDiluted net income per share of $9.92 in 2019 increased by 7% over diluted net income per share of $9.28 in 2018. Net income of $2.62 billion in 2019 increased by 4% over net income of $2.52 billion in 2018. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"). Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $886 million and $1.72 billion, respectively. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $60 million, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $517 million in 2018. Underlying underwriting margins in each of the Company's business segments were lower than in 2018. Income tax expense in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily\nreflecting the impacts of (i) the increase in income before income taxes and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\nThe Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income or segment income for the periods reported.\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $28.27 billion, $1.21 billion or 4% higher than in 2018. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 4% over 2018. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 5% over 2018. Factors contributing to the increases in earned premiums in each segment in 2019 as compared with 2018 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nNet Investment Income\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments.

Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2019 was $2.07 billion, $90 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from a higher average level of fixed maturity investments and higher long-term interest rates. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2019 was $105 million, $13 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from higher short-term interest rates. Net investment income generated by the Company's remaining investment portfolios in 2019 was $333 million, $108 million lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting lower returns from private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships.\nFee Income\nThe National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in more detail in the Business Insurance discussion that follows.\nNet Realized Investment Gains\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net pre-tax realized investment gains. Table 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses) on equity securities still held\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net realized investment gains, including from sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains\nOther net realized investment gains in 2019 included $59 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $12 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold and $15 million of net realized investment losses related to foreign currency translation and other investments.\nOther net realized investment gains in 2018 included $92 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments, primarily resulting from the sale of a private equity limited partnership, $33 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $4 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in all years also included revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 also included a gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.\nClaims and Expenses\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $19.13 billion, $842 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (vi) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (vii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Catastrophes in 2019 primarily resulted from Hurricane Dorian and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States. Catastrophes in 2018 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States and winter storms in the eastern United States.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSignificant Catastrophe Losses\nThe Company defines a catastrophe\u201d as an event:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>that is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>for which the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an\naggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2019 ranged from approximately $19 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.\nThe following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2019 and 2018 for catastrophes that occurred in 2018 and 2017, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Losses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable)\nPrior Year Reserve Development for the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Ultimate Losses at\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, pre-tax and net of reinsurance)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCS Serial Number:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>22 -

Business.\" That treaty covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2019 through and including December 31, 2019. As a result, the benefit from that treaty is not included in the table above as the allocation of the treaty's benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event.\nn/a: not applicable.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $4.60 billion, $220 million or 5% higher than in 2018. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $4.37 billion, $68 million or 2% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $344 million and $352 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $516 million, $78 million or 18% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $177 million increase in income before income taxes in 2019 and (ii) the reduction in income tax in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 16%, 15% and 25% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the respective statutory rate of 21% in both 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. The effective tax rate in 2018 also included the impact of the reduction in income tax expense resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit. The effective tax rate in 2017 reflected the net charge related to TCJA and the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 96.5% in 2019 was 0.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 96.9% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.9% in 2019 was 0.1 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.8% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2019 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2018.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.1 points and 6.3 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 0.2 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.9 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses (\"underlying combined ratio\") in 2019 was 0.7 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\nIn recent periods, both prior year reserve development and the underlying combined ratio have been impacted by adverse developments in the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.\nWritten Premiums\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: Table 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gross Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Insurance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bond & Specialty Insurance\n</td> <td>2,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Insurance\n</td> <td>10,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Insurance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bond & Specialty Insurance\n</td> <td>2,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Insurance\n</td> <td>10,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross and net written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% and 5%, respectively, over 2018.

The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) lower catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $258 million. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 was $142 million. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $470 million and $639 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes and (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the decrease in segment income before income taxes, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan.\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums of $15.30 billion in 2019 were $578 million or 4% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months, partially offset by the earned impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2019 was $1.82 billion, $17 million or 1% lower than in 2018. Refer to the Net Investment Income\u201d section of the Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2019 compared with 2018. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.\nFee Income\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to revenue from its large deductible policies and service businesses, which include risk management, claims administration, loss control and risk management information services provided to third parties, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2019 was $437 million, $25 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting higher claim volume under administration associated with its service businesses.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges, as well as revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017.\nClaims and Expenses\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $10.96 billion, $792 million or 8% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (iv) higher business volumes, partially offset by (v) lower catastrophe losses and (vi) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $2.50 billion, $115 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $2.63 billion, comparable with 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $223 million, $36 million or 14% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $282 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2019, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 100.9% in 2019 was 1.8 points higher than the combined ratio of 99.1% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3% in 2019 was 2.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.8% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 30.6% in 2019 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.3% in 2018.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.0 points and 4.4 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 1.7 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.0 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to\nthe Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\nWritten Premiums\nBusiness Insurance's gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: Table 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Select Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National Property and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Business Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Select Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National Property and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Business Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018.

Net written premiums of $1.07 billion in 2019 decreased by 1% from 2018, primarily driven by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as decreases in the Company's operations at Lloyd's.\nBond & Specialty Insurance\nResults of Bond & Specialty Insurance were as follows:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Overview\nSegment income in 2019 was $618 million, $175 million or 22% lower than segment income of $793 million in 2018. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $65 million and $266 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $5 million and $16 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes.\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $2.57 billion, $145 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2019 was $233 million, level with 2018. Included in Bond & Specialty Insurance are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in Bond & Specialty Insurance reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including net investment income from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced a decrease in investment income in 2019. Refer to the Net Investment Income\u201d section of the Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2019 as compared with the 2018. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.\nClaims and Expenses\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $1.09 billion, $322 million or 42% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher business volumes and (iii) modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $478 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $483 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $151 million, $47 million or 24% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the $222 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2019.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 79.5% in 2019 was 10.5 points higher than the combined ratio of 69.0% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 42.2% in 2019 was 10.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 31.5% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 37.3% in 2019 was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 37.5% in 2018.\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 2.5 points and 11.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 0.2 points and 0.6 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 2.4 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\nWritten Premiums\nBond & Specialty Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Bond & Specialty Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Bond & Specialty Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 10% over 2018.

The increase in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $411 million and $1.06 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $133 million and $109 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected\n(i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, mostly impacting Agency Homeowners and Other, partially offset by (iii) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in Agency Automobile and (iv) higher business volumes. Income tax expense in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the increase in segment income before income taxes and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan.\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $10.41 billion, $490 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. The increase in earned premiums in 2019 was reduced by the earned impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2019 was $419 million, $11 million or 3% higher than in 2018. Refer to the Net Investment Income\u201d section of the Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2019 as compared with the 2018.

Net prior year reserve development in 2017 was not significant.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $1.62 billion, $81 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $1.22 billion, $35 million or 3% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $195 million, $153 million or 364% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $680 million increase in income before income taxes in 2019 and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan. The level of income tax expense in both years reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's tax provision.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 94.2% in 2019 was 6.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 100.6% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.0% in 2019 was 6.1 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 74.1% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 26.2% in 2019 was 0.3 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 26.5% in 2018.\nCatastrophe losses accounted for 4.0 points and 10.7 points of the combined ratio in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 1.3 and 1.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, mostly impacting Agency Homeowners and Other, partially offset by (iii) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in Agency Automobile and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\nWritten Premiums\nPersonal Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows: Table 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowners and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct-to-Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Personal Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowners and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct-to-Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Personal Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic Agency Written Premiums\nPersonal Insurance's domestic Agency business comprises business written through agents, brokers and other intermediaries.\nDomestic Agency gross written premiums in 2019 increased by 7% over 2018.

The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.\nThe Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the\nplaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: Table 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nPolicyholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Net Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Asbestos\nReserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholders with settlement agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home office and field office policyholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumed reinsurance and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe policyholders with settlement agreements category includes certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements. Reserves in this category are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. The home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves in this category include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders in this category, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non-product\u201d exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non-product\u201d liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the high level of litigation activity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the home office and field office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims and net asbestos-related payments were comparable with 2018. Payments on behalf of policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.\nThe Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office and field office category and the assumed reinsurance and other category as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company's evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in $220 million, $225 million and $225 million increases, respectively, to the Company's net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the home office and field office category. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding mesothelioma claims discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.\nNet asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $224 million, $225 million and $271 million, respectively. Approximately 4%, 9% and 4% of total net paid losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability.\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(at and for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning reserves:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incurred losses and loss expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paid loss and loss expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending reserves:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\nSee -Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\u201d\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties.\nThe Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy-back\u201d of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which only extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. In many instances, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower-tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims as well as the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters have been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $76 million, $55 million and $65 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 92% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $296 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $25 million), consists of case reserves.\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: Table 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(at and for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning reserves:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incurred losses and loss expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paid loss and loss expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending reserves:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2019 were $77.88 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 4% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nThe carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 was $68.13 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was Aa2\u201d at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Below investment grade securities represented 2.1% and 2.3% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019 and 4.5 (4.7 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2018. The decrease in duration compared with December 31, 2018 primarily reflected the decrease in market interest rates during 2019.\nThe carrying values of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and $28.61 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.06 billion and $2.85 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds.

<td>Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $619 million of short-term securities which have high ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated A-1+\u201d and/or P-1,\u201d are included as Aaa\u201d rated securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $131 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $134 million to these partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the Eurozone.\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities\nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $3.28 billion and $2.57 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company's investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.51 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively. For more information regarding the Company's investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.\nOther Investments\nThe Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Also included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities and derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.42 billion and $3.56 billion, respectively. The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.66 billion and $1.60 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments.\nSecurities Lending\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $404 million and $367 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2019 and 2018 was $368 million and $319 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLloyd's Trust Deposits\nThe Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd's using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company's subsidiaries participating in Lloyd's, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $173 million and $115 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $34 million and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd's capital requirements. For more information regarding the Company's utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein.\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe net unrealized investment gains (losses) that were included in shareholders' equity were as follows:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(at December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized investment gains (losses) before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized investment gains (losses) included in accumulated other comprehensive income at year end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of TCJA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized investment gains (losses) included in shareholders' equity at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 as compared to net unrealized losses at December 31, 2018. This change is due to a decline in interest rates during 2019. Equity securities, which\ninclude public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Prior to January 1, 2018, equity securities were classified as available for sale, and changes in their fair value were charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had no fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost.\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, below investment grade securities comprised 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2019 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $152 million and a fair value of $146 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $6 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 and accounted for approximately 21% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment gains in the consolidated statement of income were $4 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPurchases and Sales of Investment Securities\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $8 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $317 million.\nCATASTROPHE MODELING\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.\nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge.\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2019. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2019.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars (in billions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Likelihood of Exceedance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Single U.S. and\nCanadian\nHurricane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Single U.S. and\nCanadian\nEarthquake\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.0% (1-in-50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.0% (1-in-100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.4% (1-in-250)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.1% (1-in-1,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Common Equity (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Likelihood of Exceedance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Single U.S. and\nCanadian\nHurricane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Single U.S. and\nCanadian\nEarthquake\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.0% (1-in-50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.0% (1-in-100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.4% (1-in-250)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.1% (1-in-1,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a 1-in-50 year event.\u201d As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2019 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2020, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's reinsurance, see Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.\u201d The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors- We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.\u201d\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS\nSevere weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. The insurance industry experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, more people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion and an increase in the average size of a house. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. The frequency and severity of wildfire losses have been elevated in more recent years, due in part to record droughts in California that some climate studies suggest are likely to increase over time. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have expanded the Company's potential for losses from wildfires. Moreover, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions, inadequate reflection of regulatory changes and the other factors mentioned above. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events.\nThe Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Outlook.\u201d For example, among other things:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\u201d and -Outlook-Underwriting Gain/Loss.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, a state recently passed legislation that restricts a carrier's ability to cancel or non-renew policies within or adjacent to declared state emergency zip codes. If the Company is unable to implement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\u201d In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to changing climate conditions. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nemerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products.

In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments.

On December 23, 2019, the parties agreed to extend the closing deadline for the transaction until March 31, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.\nOUTLOOK\nThe following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position.\nPremiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOverall, the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2020. In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Personal Insurance, the Company expects that domestic Agency Automobile renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive but will be lower than the level attained in 2019. The Company expects that domestic Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal and many commercial property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium that the Company generates from outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd's, international renewal premium changes during 2020 could be somewhat higher, broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2019; however, the Company expects that international renewal premium changes for the first half of 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in the same period of 2019.\nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2020 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.\nEconomic conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change due to a variety of factors, including the political and regulatory environment, changes to monetary policy, inflation or deflation (including the impact of rapid changes in wages and/or commodity prices), changes in tariffs or other international trade regulations, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, high levels of global debt after an extended period of low interest rates, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, a shutdown of the U.S. government, the failure by the U.S. government to raise the debt ceiling, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and further potential changes in tax laws or health care legislation in the United States. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written premiums during 2020, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be impacted on a lagging basis.\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss trend; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.\nCatastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and/or non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.\nOn average over the last ten years, the Company has experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.\nOver the past decade, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or, as was the case in 2019, unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.\nIt is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company's loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors-If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nIn Business Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019, assuming the anticipated impacts of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved results in the Company's international business. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year as a result of the timing impact of higher loss estimates recognized in the same periods of 2019 in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly consistent with 2019 and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher than in 2019.\nIn Personal Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In Agency Automobile, the Company expects\nthat for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin and the underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2019. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses.\nInvestment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on the impact of expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments, partially offset by slightly higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that for 2020, after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $5 million to $10 million lower on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2019. The impact of future market conditions on net investment income from the Company's non-fixed income investment portfolios for 2020 is hard to predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or significant realized investment gains or losses (including impairments) compared with 2019.\nThe Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.85 billion ($2.25 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio.

In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 5% over 2018. Factors contributing to the increases in earned premiums in each segment in 2019 as compared with 2018 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2019. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2019.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Written Premiums\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowners and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct-to-Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Personal Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net pre-tax realized investment gains. \nFee Income\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe combined ratio of 100.9% in 2019 was 1.8 points higher than the combined ratio of 99.1% in 2018.

The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains\nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge.\nThe carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 was $68.13 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was Aa2\u201d at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Below investment grade securities represented 2.1% and 2.3% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019 and 4.5 (4.7 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2018. The decrease in duration compared with December 31, 2018 primarily reflected the decrease in market interest rates during 2019.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Losses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable)\nPrior Year Reserve Development for the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Ultimate Losses at\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, pre-tax and net of reinsurance)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCS Serial Number:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>22 -

While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio.

The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) lower catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $258 million. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 was $142 million. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $470 million and $639 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes and (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the decrease in segment income before income taxes, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $411 million and $1.06 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $133 million and $109 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected\nDirect-to-Consumer net written premiums in 2019 were 4% higher than in 2018, primarily driven by growth in homeowners and other. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $8 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $317 million.\n\nNational Accounts. Net written premiums of $1.05 billion in 2019 increased by 3% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 included a benefit related to a transaction to close out prior year liabilities with a former customer. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 were slightly positive but lower than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nPersonal Insurance\nLloyd's Trust Deposits\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower-tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims as well as the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters have been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $76 million, $55 million and $65 million, respectively.\nIncluded in total reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2019 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant insurer from each such insurer group at February 13, 2020:\nOther Revenues\nFactors contributing to the changes in gross and net written premiums in each segment in 2019 as compared with 2018 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nThe combined ratio of 94.2% in 2019 was 6.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 100.6% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.0% in 2019 was 6.1 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 74.1% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 26.2% in 2019 was 0.3 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 26.5% in 2018.\n (2) Sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Federal Ship Financing Programs. \nDebt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments\nThe Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd's using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company's subsidiaries participating in Lloyd's, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $173 million and $115 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $34 million and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd's capital requirements. For more information regarding the Company's utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein.\n (2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.  The threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2019 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2020, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's reinsurance, see Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.\u201d The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.\n___________________________________________\nFor its domestic Agency business, Personal Insurance had approximately 7.5 million and 7.2 million active policies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $4.60 billion, $220 million or 5% higher than in 2018. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nNet Investment Income\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n \u2022 Net income of $2.62 billion, or $10.01 per share basic and $9.92 per share diluted \nThe National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in more detail in the Business Insurance discussion that follows.\nWritten Premiums\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in $220 million, $225 million and $225 million increases, respectively, to the Company's net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the home office and field office category. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding mesothelioma claims discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.\nEconomic conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change due to a variety of factors, including the political and regulatory environment, changes to monetary policy, inflation or deflation (including the impact of rapid changes in wages and/or commodity prices), changes in tariffs or other international trade regulations, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, high levels of global debt after an extended period of low interest rates, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, a shutdown of the U.S. government, the failure by the U.S. government to raise the debt ceiling, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and further potential changes in tax laws or health care legislation in the United States. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written premiums during 2020, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be impacted on a lagging basis.\nthe Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\nWritten Premiums\n\nThe following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2019 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant reinsurer from each such reinsurer group at February 13, 2020:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n(1) Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaty, the terms of which are described in \"Part I-Item 1 - Business.\" That treaty covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2019 through and including December 31, 2019. As a result, the benefit from that treaty is not included in the table above as the allocation of the treaty's benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event.\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges, as well as revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017.\nBusiness Insurance\nDomestic Agency Homeowners and Other net written premiums of $4.54 billion in 2019 were 9% higher than in 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 16%, 15% and 25% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the respective statutory rate of 21% in both 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. The effective tax rate in 2018 also included the impact of the reduction in income tax expense resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit. The effective tax rate in 2017 reflected the net charge related to TCJA and the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters.\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 10% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 increased by 8% over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by higher ceded written premiums for several reinsurance treaties, including those related to the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy-back\u201d of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which only extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. In many instances, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.\n \u2022 Catastrophe losses of $886 million ($699 million after-tax) \n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.  (2) No other country accounted for 2.5% or more of total debt securities issued by foreign governments.\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $10.41 billion, $490 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. The increase in earned premiums in 2019 was reduced by the earned impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nInvestment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nIn recent periods, both prior year reserve development and the underlying combined ratio have been impacted by adverse developments in the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.\nRevenues\nIncome Tax Expense\n \u2022 while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the high level of litigation activity; and \nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $29.92 billion and $28.61 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.06 billion and $2.85 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company's holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities.\nNet asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $224 million, $225 million and $271 million, respectively. Approximately 4%, 9% and 4% of total net paid losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability.\nEarned Premiums\n(1) On February 7, 2020, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. announced that it had signed a merger agreement to acquire FGL Holdings (Fidelity & Guaranty Life Group). The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2020, and is subject to the approval of FGL Holdings stockholders and federal and state regulators, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nCombined Ratio\nn/a: not applicable.\n \u2022 for which the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.  The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nResults of Bond & Specialty Insurance were as follows:\n___________________________________________\n \u2022 Holding company liquidity of $1.43 billion \nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.51 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively. For more information regarding the Company's investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Outlook.\u201d For example, among other things:\nNet Investment Income\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $1.09 billion, $322 million or 42% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher business volumes and (iii) modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\n \u2022 a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nIn Business Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019, assuming the anticipated impacts of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved results in the Company's international business. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year as a result of the timing impact of higher loss estimates recognized in the same periods of 2019 in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line.\n___________________________________________\nThe Company reported net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 as compared to net unrealized losses at December 31, 2018. This change is due to a decline in interest rates during 2019. Equity securities, which\nPurchases and Sales of Investment Securities\n \u2022 Net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $60 million ($47 million after-tax) \n\n___________________________________________\n \u2022 Total debt of $6.56 billion, resulting in a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.2% (21.7% excluding net unrealized investment gains, net of tax, included in shareholders' equity) \nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $7.08 billion, $272 million or 4% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) loss cost trends.\nClaims and Expenses\nSee -Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\u201d\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors- We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.\u201d\n\n (3) Included in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $557 million and $456 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, respectively, and $2 million of securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.  The following table sets forth the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist:\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.\n___________________________________________\nOther net realized investment gains in 2018 included $92 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments, primarily resulting from the sale of a private equity limited partnership, $33 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $4 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold.\nOver the past decade, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or, as was the case in 2019, unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.\nBond & Specialty Insurance\nOther Revenues\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\n\n (2) No other single state accounted for 2.5% or more of the total non-pre-refunded municipal bonds. \nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nGross and net written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% and 5%, respectively, over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by ceded written premiums related to the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nImpairment Charges\nFor further discussion of the Company's investment portfolio, see Investment Portfolio.\u201d For a discussion of the risks to the Company's business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the Company's investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected\u201d and Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses\u201d included in Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d For a discussion of the risks to the Company's investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the United States\u201d included in Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and see Part II-\n \u2022 Net unrealized investment gains of $2.85 billion ($2.25 billion after-tax) \nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $478 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nMiddle Market. Net written premiums of $8.63 billion in 2019 increased by 5% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 were lower than in 2018.\nOther Investments\nThe following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2019 and 2018 for catastrophes that occurred in 2018 and 2017, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.\nFor its International and Direct-to-Consumer business, Personal Insurance had approximately 869,000 and 900,000 active policies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIt is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company's loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors-If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nThe combined ratio of 79.5% in 2019 was 10.5 points higher than the combined ratio of 69.0% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 42.2% in 2019 was 10.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 31.5% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 37.3% in 2019 was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 37.5% in 2018.\nEarned Premiums\nThe Income (loss) for Interest Expense and Other in 2019 was $1 million lower than in 2018. Pre-tax interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $344 million and $352 million, respectively. After-tax interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $272 million and $278 million, respectively.\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in all years also included revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 also included a gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $1.62 billion, $81 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 increased by 4% over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities\n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.\nNational Property and Other. Net written premiums of $1.97 billion in 2019 increased by 9% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nreflecting the impacts of (i) the increase in income before income taxes and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\n___________________________________________\n2019 Consolidated Financial Condition\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. \nPersonal Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows: \nNet investment income in 2019 was $233 million, level with 2018. Included in Bond & Specialty Insurance are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in Bond & Specialty Insurance reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including net investment income from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced a decrease in investment income in 2019. Refer to the Net Investment Income\u201d section of the Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2019 as compared with the 2018. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.\nCombined Ratio\nCombined Ratio\nDomestic. Net written premiums in 2019 were $2.47 billion, $181 million or 8% higher than in 2018. Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nDomestic Agency Automobile net written premiums of $5.12 billion in 2019 were 3% higher than in 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive but were lower than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nCombined Ratio\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2019 were $77.88 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 4% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.\nFee Income\nThe combined ratio of 96.5% in 2019 was 0.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 96.9% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.9% in 2019 was 0.1 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.8% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2019 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2018.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.1 points and 6.3 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 0.2 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.9 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses (\"underlying combined ratio\") in 2019 was 0.7 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\n \u2022 Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\u201d \nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $3.28 billion and $2.57 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company's investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: \nNet Investment Income\n \u2022 Total assets of $110.12 billion \nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non-product\u201d liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:\nRevenues\nIn Personal Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In Agency Automobile, the Company expects\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n (1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a 1-in-50 year event.\u201d As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. \nCatastrophe losses accounted for 4.0 points and 10.7 points of the combined ratio in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 1.3 and 1.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, mostly impacting Agency Homeowners and Other, partially offset by (iii) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in Agency Automobile and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\n \u2022 Net earned premiums of $28.27 billion \nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly consistent with 2019 and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher than in 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nInternational. Net written premiums of $1.07 billion in 2019 decreased by 1% from 2018, primarily driven by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as decreases in the Company's operations at Lloyd's.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, including year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 have been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\nThe following table shows the Company's Eurozone exposure at December 31, 2019 to all debt securities issued by foreign governments, financial companies, sovereign corporations (including sovereign banks) whose securities are backed by the respective country's government and all other corporate securities (comprised of industrial corporations and utility companies) which could be affected if economic conditions deteriorated due to a prolonged recession:\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges.\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the $27.86 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2019 that were not pre-refunded: \nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES\nThe Company defines a catastrophe\u201d as an event:\nInternational net written premiums in 2019 were comparable with 2018.\nClaims and Expenses\nThe policyholders with settlement agreements category includes certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements. Reserves in this category are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. The home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves in this category include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders in this category, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non-product\u201d exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.\nCatastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and/or non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.\n \u2022 The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to changing climate conditions. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews \nClaims and Expenses\nOther net realized investment gains in 2019 included $59 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $12 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold and $15 million of net realized investment losses related to foreign currency translation and other investments.\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.\n (1) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income. \nOn average over the last ten years, the Company has experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.0 points and 4.4 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 1.7 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.0 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to\nDiluted net income per share of $9.92 in 2019 increased by 7% over diluted net income per share of $9.28 in 2018. Net income of $2.62 billion in 2019 increased by 4% over net income of $2.52 billion in 2018. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"). Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $886 million and $1.72 billion, respectively. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $60 million, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $517 million in 2018. Underlying underwriting margins in each of the Company's business segments were lower than in 2018. Income tax expense in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily\n \u2022 Net investment income of $2.47 billion ($2.10 billion after-tax)  \u2022Operating cash flows of $5.21 billion\nInterest Expense\nDomestic Agency Written Premiums\n (2) On October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial (Genworth) announced that they entered into a definitive agreement under which China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (China Oceanwide) agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genworth. China Oceanwide is a privately held, family-owned international financial holding group headquartered in Beijing, China. On March 7, 2017, Genworth stockholders adopted the merger agreement, and the acquisition is pending the receipt of required regulatory approvals. On December 23, 2019, the parties agreed to extend the closing deadline for the transaction until March 31, 2020.  The Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.\nInternational. Net written premiums in 2019 were $268 million, $30 million or 13% higher than in 2018, primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom and Canada, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $483 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 2.5 points and 11.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 0.2 points and 0.6 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 2.4 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\n \u2022 Repurchased 11.2 million common shares for total cost of $1.55 billion and paid $844 million of dividends to shareholders \nThe net unrealized investment gains (losses) that were included in shareholders' equity were as follows:\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $19.13 billion, $842 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (vi) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (vii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Catastrophes in 2019 primarily resulted from Hurricane Dorian and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States. Catastrophes in 2018 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States and winter storms in the eastern United States.\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves:\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default. \nIncome Tax Expense\nDirect-to-Consumer and International Written Premiums\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company held $823 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.\n\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings). Total income tax expense for 2017 included a net charge of $129 million to reflect the estimated impact of the changes in tax law and tax rates included in TCJA at the date of enactment, primarily reflecting the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory federal tax rate of 21%, and the recognition of tax imposed on the accumulated foreign earnings.  The following discussions of the Company's net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.\n \u2022 Combined ratio of 96.5% \n\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $2.57 billion, $145 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses)\nResults of Business Insurance were as follows: \nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 92% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $296 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $25 million), consists of case reserves.\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $404 million and $367 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2019 and 2018 was $368 million and $319 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to revenue from its large deductible policies and service businesses, which include risk management, claims administration, loss control and risk management information services provided to third parties, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2019 was $437 million, $25 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting higher claim volume under administration associated with its service businesses.\n\n___________________________________________\nNet Realized Investment Gains\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $1.22 billion, $35 million or 3% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\n___________________________________________\n\naggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2019 ranged from approximately $19 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.\nEarned Premiums\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Net prior year reserve development in 2017 was not significant.\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $619 million of short-term securities which have high ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated A-1+\u201d and/or P-1,\u201d are included as Aaa\u201d rated securities.  In addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $131 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $134 million to these partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the Eurozone.\nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2020 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default.  The Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. The weighted average credit rating of the municipal bond portfolio was Aaa/Aa1\u201d at December 31, 2019.\nBond & Specialty Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows:\n\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties.\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $516 million, $78 million or 18% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $177 million increase in income before income taxes in 2019 and (ii) the reduction in income tax in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: \nObligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions\n \u2022 Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, a state recently passed legislation that restricts a carrier's ability to cancel or non-renew policies within or adjacent to declared state emergency zip codes. If the Company is unable to implement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\u201d In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\nInterest Expense and Other\n___________________________________________\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on the impact of expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments, partially offset by slightly higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that for 2020, after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $5 million to $10 million lower on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2019. The impact of future market conditions on net investment income from the Company's non-fixed income investment portfolios for 2020 is hard to predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or significant realized investment gains or losses (including impairments) compared with 2019.\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).  Overview\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments at December 31, 2019:\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss trend; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.\nThe Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.\nThe Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.\n\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.\n2019 Consolidated Results of Operations\nThe Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Also included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities and derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.42 billion and $3.56 billion, respectively. The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.66 billion and $1.60 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments.\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.\nWritten Premiums\nplaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.\nNet Investment Income\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).  Overview\nThe Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income or segment income for the periods reported.\n\nOverall, the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2020. In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Personal Insurance, the Company expects that domestic Agency Automobile renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive but will be lower than the level attained in 2019. The Company expects that domestic Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal and many commercial property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium that the Company generates from outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd's, international renewal premium changes during 2020 could be somewhat higher, broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2019; however, the Company expects that international renewal premium changes for the first half of 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in the same period of 2019.\n___________________________________________\nthat for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin and the underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2019. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses.\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: \nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $223 million, $36 million or 14% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $282 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2019, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, below investment grade securities comprised 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2019 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $152 million and a fair value of $146 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $6 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 and accounted for approximately 21% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nSegment income in 2019 was $618 million, $175 million or 22% lower than segment income of $793 million in 2018. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $65 million and $266 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $5 million and $16 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes.\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $10.96 billion, $792 million or 8% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (iv) higher business volumes, partially offset by (v) lower catastrophe losses and (vi) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\nSecurities Lending\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $2.50 billion, $115 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n \u2022 Shareholders' equity of $25.94 billion \nIn the home office and field office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims and net asbestos-related payments were comparable with 2018. Payments on behalf of policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.\n\n___________________________________________\nEarned Premiums\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables:\nOther Revenues\nSevere weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. The insurance industry experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, more people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion and an increase in the average size of a house. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. The frequency and severity of wildfire losses have been elevated in more recent years, due in part to record droughts in California that some climate studies suggest are likely to increase over time. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have expanded the Company's potential for losses from wildfires. Moreover, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions, inadequate reflection of regulatory changes and the other factors mentioned above. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events.\nInterest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $344 million and $352 million, respectively.\n (2) Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.  Net investment income in 2019 was $2.47 billion, comparable with 2018. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2019 was $2.07 billion, $90 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from a higher average level of fixed maturity investments and higher long-term interest rates. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2019 was $105 million, $13 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from higher short-term interest rates. Net investment income generated by the Company's remaining investment portfolios in 2019 was $333 million, $108 million lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting lower returns from private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships.", "item_7_text": " (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).

Net written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position.\nClaims and Expenses\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $28.27 billion, $1.21 billion or 4% higher than in 2018. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 4% over 2018. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2019 increased by 5% over 2018. Factors contributing to the increases in earned premiums in each segment in 2019 as compared with 2018 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2019. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net pre-tax realized investment gains. \nFee Income\nThe combined ratio of 100.9% in 2019 was 1.8 points higher than the combined ratio of 99.1% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3% in 2019 was 2.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.8% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 30.6% in 2019 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.3% in 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nThe following table displays the funding sources for the $10.32 billion of municipal bonds identified as revenue bonds in the foregoing table at December 31, 2019:\nNet investment income in 2019 was $1.82 billion, $17 million or 1% lower than in 2018.

In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains\nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge.\nThe carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 was $68.13 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was Aa2\u201d at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Below investment grade securities represented 2.1% and 2.3% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019 and 4.5 (4.7 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2018. The decrease in duration compared with December 31, 2018 primarily reflected the decrease in market interest rates during 2019.\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments. \n \u2022 that is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and \nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $195 million, $153 million or 364% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $680 million increase in income before income taxes in 2019 and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan. The level of income tax expense in both years reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's tax provision.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nThe Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.85 billion ($2.25 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio. See Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us\u201d included in Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nSegment income in 2019 was $1.39 billion, $246 million or 15% lower than segment income of $1.64 billion in 2018. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) lower catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $258 million. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 was $142 million. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $470 million and $639 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes and (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the decrease in segment income before income taxes, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $2.63 billion, comparable with 2018.\nThe Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the Company's reinsurance coverage, see Part I-Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.\u201d\nThe Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office and field office category and the assumed reinsurance and other category as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company's evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.\n___________________________________________\n\nIncome Tax Expense\nPremiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEarned premiums of $15.30 billion in 2019 were $578 million or 4% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months, partially offset by the earned impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nThe carrying values of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWritten Premiums\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $4.37 billion, $68 million or 2% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had no fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 Total investments of $77.88 billion; fixed maturities and short-term securities comprise 94% of total investments \n\nOverview\nNet reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2019 were comparable to recoverables at December 31, 2018.\n___________________________________________\nSelect Accounts. Net written premiums of $2.91 billion in 2019 increased by 3% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nRevenues\nemerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after we issue our policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\u201d\nSignificant Catastrophe Losses\n \u2022 Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\u201d and -Outlook-Underwriting Gain/Loss.\u201d \nRevenues\nSegment income in 2019 was $824 million, $527 million or 177% higher than segment income of $297 million in 2018. The increase in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $411 million and $1.06 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $133 million and $109 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected\nDirect-to-Consumer net written premiums in 2019 were 4% higher than in 2018, primarily driven by growth in homeowners and other. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $8 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $317 million.\n\nNational Accounts. Net written premiums of $1.05 billion in 2019 increased by 3% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 included a benefit related to a transaction to close out prior year liabilities with a former customer. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 were slightly positive but lower than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nPersonal Insurance\nLloyd's Trust Deposits\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower-tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims as well as the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters have been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $76 million, $55 million and $65 million, respectively.\nIncluded in total reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2019 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant insurer from each such insurer group at February 13, 2020:\nOther Revenues\nFactors contributing to the changes in gross and net written premiums in each segment in 2019 as compared with 2018 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nThe combined ratio of 94.2% in 2019 was 6.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 100.6% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.0% in 2019 was 6.1 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 74.1% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 26.2% in 2019 was 0.3 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 26.5% in 2018.\n (2) Sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Federal Ship Financing Programs. \nDebt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments\nThe Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd's using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company's subsidiaries participating in Lloyd's, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $173 million and $115 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $34 million and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd's capital requirements. For more information regarding the Company's utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein.\n (2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.  The threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2019 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2020, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's reinsurance, see Item 1 - Business-Reinsurance.\u201d The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.\n___________________________________________\nFor its domestic Agency business, Personal Insurance had approximately 7.5 million and 7.2 million active policies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $4.60 billion, $220 million or 5% higher than in 2018. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nNet Investment Income\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n \u2022 Net income of $2.62 billion, or $10.01 per share basic and $9.92 per share diluted \nThe National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in more detail in the Business Insurance discussion that follows.\nWritten Premiums\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in $220 million, $225 million and $225 million increases, respectively, to the Company's net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the home office and field office category. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding mesothelioma claims discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.\nEconomic conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change due to a variety of factors, including the political and regulatory environment, changes to monetary policy, inflation or deflation (including the impact of rapid changes in wages and/or commodity prices), changes in tariffs or other international trade regulations, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, high levels of global debt after an extended period of low interest rates, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, a shutdown of the U.S. government, the failure by the U.S. government to raise the debt ceiling, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and further potential changes in tax laws or health care legislation in the United States. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written premiums during 2020, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be impacted on a lagging basis.\nthe Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by (iii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\nWritten Premiums\n\nThe following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2019 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant reinsurer from each such reinsurer group at February 13, 2020:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n(1) Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaty, the terms of which are described in \"Part I-Item 1 - Business.\" That treaty covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2019 through and including December 31, 2019. As a result, the benefit from that treaty is not included in the table above as the allocation of the treaty's benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event.\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges, as well as revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017.\nBusiness Insurance\nDomestic Agency Homeowners and Other net written premiums of $4.54 billion in 2019 were 9% higher than in 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 16%, 15% and 25% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the respective statutory rate of 21% in both 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. The effective tax rate in 2018 also included the impact of the reduction in income tax expense resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit. The effective tax rate in 2017 reflected the net charge related to TCJA and the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters.\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 10% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 increased by 8% over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by higher ceded written premiums for several reinsurance treaties, including those related to the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy-back\u201d of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which only extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. In many instances, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.\n \u2022 Catastrophe losses of $886 million ($699 million after-tax) \n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.  (2) No other country accounted for 2.5% or more of total debt securities issued by foreign governments.\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $10.41 billion, $490 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. The increase in earned premiums in 2019 was reduced by the earned impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.\nInvestment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2019. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nIn recent periods, both prior year reserve development and the underlying combined ratio have been impacted by adverse developments in the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.\nRevenues\nIncome Tax Expense\n \u2022 while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the high level of litigation activity; and \nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $29.92 billion and $28.61 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.06 billion and $2.85 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company's holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities.\nNet asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $224 million, $225 million and $271 million, respectively. Approximately 4%, 9% and 4% of total net paid losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability.\nEarned Premiums\n(1) On February 7, 2020, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. announced that it had signed a merger agreement to acquire FGL Holdings (Fidelity & Guaranty Life Group). The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2020, and is subject to the approval of FGL Holdings stockholders and federal and state regulators, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nCombined Ratio\nn/a: not applicable.\n \u2022 for which the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.  The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nResults of Bond & Specialty Insurance were as follows:\n___________________________________________\n \u2022 Holding company liquidity of $1.43 billion \nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.51 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively. For more information regarding the Company's investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Outlook.\u201d For example, among other things:\nNet Investment Income\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $1.09 billion, $322 million or 42% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher business volumes and (iii) modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\n \u2022 a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nIn Business Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019, assuming the anticipated impacts of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved results in the Company's international business. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year as a result of the timing impact of higher loss estimates recognized in the same periods of 2019 in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line.\n___________________________________________\nThe Company reported net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 as compared to net unrealized losses at December 31, 2018. This change is due to a decline in interest rates during 2019. Equity securities, which\nPurchases and Sales of Investment Securities\n \u2022 Net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $60 million ($47 million after-tax) \n\n___________________________________________\n \u2022 Total debt of $6.56 billion, resulting in a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.2% (21.7% excluding net unrealized investment gains, net of tax, included in shareholders' equity) \nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $7.08 billion, $272 million or 4% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) loss cost trends.\nClaims and Expenses\nSee -Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\u201d\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors- We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.\u201d\n\n (3) Included in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $557 million and $456 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, respectively, and $2 million of securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.  The following table sets forth the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist:\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.\n___________________________________________\nOther net realized investment gains in 2018 included $92 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments, primarily resulting from the sale of a private equity limited partnership, $33 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $4 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold.\nOver the past decade, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or, as was the case in 2019, unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.\nBond & Specialty Insurance\nOther Revenues\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\n\n (2) No other single state accounted for 2.5% or more of the total non-pre-refunded municipal bonds. \nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nGross and net written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% and 5%, respectively, over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by ceded written premiums related to the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nImpairment Charges\nFor further discussion of the Company's investment portfolio, see Investment Portfolio.\u201d For a discussion of the risks to the Company's business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the Company's investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected\u201d and Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses\u201d included in Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d For a discussion of the risks to the Company's investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the United States\u201d included in Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and see Part II-\n \u2022 Net unrealized investment gains of $2.85 billion ($2.25 billion after-tax) \nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $478 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nMiddle Market. Net written premiums of $8.63 billion in 2019 increased by 5% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 were lower than in 2018.\nOther Investments\nThe following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2019 and 2018 for catastrophes that occurred in 2018 and 2017, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.\nFor its International and Direct-to-Consumer business, Personal Insurance had approximately 869,000 and 900,000 active policies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIt is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company's loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors-If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nThe combined ratio of 79.5% in 2019 was 10.5 points higher than the combined ratio of 69.0% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 42.2% in 2019 was 10.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 31.5% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 37.3% in 2019 was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 37.5% in 2018.\nEarned Premiums\nThe Income (loss) for Interest Expense and Other in 2019 was $1 million lower than in 2018. Pre-tax interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $344 million and $352 million, respectively. After-tax interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $272 million and $278 million, respectively.\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in all years also included revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 also included a gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $1.62 billion, $81 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nGross written premiums in 2019 increased by 6% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 increased by 4% over 2018. Net written premium growth in 2019 was impacted by the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2019.\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities\n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.\nNational Property and Other. Net written premiums of $1.97 billion in 2019 increased by 9% over 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nreflecting the impacts of (i) the increase in income before income taxes and (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\n___________________________________________\n2019 Consolidated Financial Condition\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. \nPersonal Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows: \nNet investment income in 2019 was $233 million, level with 2018. Included in Bond & Specialty Insurance are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in Bond & Specialty Insurance reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including net investment income from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced a decrease in investment income in 2019. Refer to the Net Investment Income\u201d section of the Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2019 as compared with the 2018. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.\nCombined Ratio\nCombined Ratio\nDomestic. Net written premiums in 2019 were $2.47 billion, $181 million or 8% higher than in 2018. Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive and were higher than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nDomestic Agency Automobile net written premiums of $5.12 billion in 2019 were 3% higher than in 2018. Net written premiums in 2019 were reduced by the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Business retention rates remained strong in 2019. Renewal premium changes in 2019 remained positive but were lower than in 2018. New business premiums in 2019 increased over 2018.\nCombined Ratio\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2019 were $77.88 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 4% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.\nFee Income\nThe combined ratio of 96.5% in 2019 was 0.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 96.9% in 2018. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.9% in 2019 was 0.1 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.8% in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2019 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2018.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.1 points and 6.3 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 0.2 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.9 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses (\"underlying combined ratio\") in 2019 was 0.7 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (iv) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\n \u2022 Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\u201d \nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $3.28 billion and $2.57 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company's investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: \nNet Investment Income\n \u2022 Total assets of $110.12 billion \nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non-product\u201d liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:\nRevenues\nIn Personal Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In Agency Automobile, the Company expects\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n (1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a 1-in-50 year event.\u201d As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. \nCatastrophe losses accounted for 4.0 points and 10.7 points of the combined ratio in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 1.3 and 1.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Agency Homeowners and Other and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to the Company's new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, mostly impacting Agency Homeowners and Other, partially offset by (iii) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in Agency Automobile and (iv) a lower underwriting expense ratio.\n \u2022 Net earned premiums of $28.27 billion \nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly consistent with 2019 and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher than in 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nInternational. Net written premiums of $1.07 billion in 2019 decreased by 1% from 2018, primarily driven by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as decreases in the Company's operations at Lloyd's.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, including year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 have been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n\nThe following table shows the Company's Eurozone exposure at December 31, 2019 to all debt securities issued by foreign governments, financial companies, sovereign corporations (including sovereign banks) whose securities are backed by the respective country's government and all other corporate securities (comprised of industrial corporations and utility companies) which could be affected if economic conditions deteriorated due to a prolonged recession:\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges.\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the $27.86 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2019 that were not pre-refunded: \nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES\nThe Company defines a catastrophe\u201d as an event:\nInternational net written premiums in 2019 were comparable with 2018.\nClaims and Expenses\nThe policyholders with settlement agreements category includes certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements. Reserves in this category are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. The home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves in this category include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders in this category, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non-product\u201d exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.\nCatastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and/or non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.\n \u2022 The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to changing climate conditions. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews \nClaims and Expenses\nOther net realized investment gains in 2019 included $59 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $12 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold and $15 million of net realized investment losses related to foreign currency translation and other investments.\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.\n (1) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income. \nOn average over the last ten years, the Company has experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.\nCatastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 3.0 points and 4.4 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 accounted for 1.7 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 provided 1.0 points of benefit to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 0.5 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (ii) the impact on earned premiums related to\nDiluted net income per share of $9.92 in 2019 increased by 7% over diluted net income per share of $9.28 in 2018. Net income of $2.62 billion in 2019 increased by 4% over net income of $2.52 billion in 2018. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 and (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"). Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $886 million and $1.72 billion, respectively. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was $60 million, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $517 million in 2018. Underlying underwriting margins in each of the Company's business segments were lower than in 2018. Income tax expense in 2019 was higher than in 2018, primarily\n \u2022 Net investment income of $2.47 billion ($2.10 billion after-tax)  \u2022Operating cash flows of $5.21 billion\nInterest Expense\nDomestic Agency Written Premiums\n (2) On October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial (Genworth) announced that they entered into a definitive agreement under which China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (China Oceanwide) agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genworth. China Oceanwide is a privately held, family-owned international financial holding group headquartered in Beijing, China. On March 7, 2017, Genworth stockholders adopted the merger agreement, and the acquisition is pending the receipt of required regulatory approvals. On December 23, 2019, the parties agreed to extend the closing deadline for the transaction until March 31, 2020.  The Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.\nInternational. Net written premiums in 2019 were $268 million, $30 million or 13% higher than in 2018, primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom and Canada, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $483 million, $24 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 provided 2.5 points and 11.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 accounted for 0.2 points and 0.6 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2019 was 2.4 points higher than the 2018 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages.\n \u2022 Repurchased 11.2 million common shares for total cost of $1.55 billion and paid $844 million of dividends to shareholders \nThe net unrealized investment gains (losses) that were included in shareholders' equity were as follows:\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $19.13 billion, $842 million or 5% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability line for primary and excess coverages and in the commercial automobile product line, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by (vi) significantly lower catastrophe losses and (vii) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line. Catastrophes in 2019 primarily resulted from Hurricane Dorian and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States. Catastrophes in 2018 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States and winter storms in the eastern United States.\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves:\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default. \nIncome Tax Expense\nDirect-to-Consumer and International Written Premiums\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company held $823 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.\n\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings). Total income tax expense for 2017 included a net charge of $129 million to reflect the estimated impact of the changes in tax law and tax rates included in TCJA at the date of enactment, primarily reflecting the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory federal tax rate of 21%, and the recognition of tax imposed on the accumulated foreign earnings.  The following discussions of the Company's net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.\n \u2022 Combined ratio of 96.5% \n\nEarned premiums in 2019 were $2.57 billion, $145 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses)\nResults of Business Insurance were as follows: \nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 92% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $296 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $25 million), consists of case reserves.\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $404 million and $367 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2019 and 2018 was $368 million and $319 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to revenue from its large deductible policies and service businesses, which include risk management, claims administration, loss control and risk management information services provided to third parties, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2019 was $437 million, $25 million or 6% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting higher claim volume under administration associated with its service businesses.\n\n___________________________________________\nNet Realized Investment Gains\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 were $1.22 billion, $35 million or 3% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.\n___________________________________________\n\naggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2019 ranged from approximately $19 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.\nEarned Premiums\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Net prior year reserve development in 2017 was not significant.\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $619 million of short-term securities which have high ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated A-1+\u201d and/or P-1,\u201d are included as Aaa\u201d rated securities.  In addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $131 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $134 million to these partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the Eurozone.\nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2020 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.\n (1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default.  The Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. The weighted average credit rating of the municipal bond portfolio was Aaa/Aa1\u201d at December 31, 2019.\nBond & Specialty Insurance's gross and net written premiums were as follows:\n\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties.\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.\nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $516 million, $78 million or 18% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $177 million increase in income before income taxes in 2019 and (ii) the reduction in income tax in 2018 resulting from the Company's $200 million voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan, which provided a 35% tax benefit rather than a 21% tax benefit.\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: \nObligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions\n \u2022 Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, a state recently passed legislation that restricts a carrier's ability to cancel or non-renew policies within or adjacent to declared state emergency zip codes. If the Company is unable to implement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See Item 1A - Risk Factors-High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\u201d In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\nInterest Expense and Other\n___________________________________________\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on the impact of expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments, partially offset by slightly higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that for 2020, after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $5 million to $10 million lower on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2019. The impact of future market conditions on net investment income from the Company's non-fixed income investment portfolios for 2020 is hard to predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or significant realized investment gains or losses (including impairments) compared with 2019.\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).  Overview\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments at December 31, 2019:\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss trend; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.\nThe Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.\nThe Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.\n\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.\n2019 Consolidated Results of Operations\nThe Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Also included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities and derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.42 billion and $3.56 billion, respectively. The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.66 billion and $1.60 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments.\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.\nWritten Premiums\nplaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.\nNet Investment Income\n (1) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings).  Overview\nThe Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income or segment income for the periods reported.\n\nOverall, the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2020. In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. In Personal Insurance, the Company expects that domestic Agency Automobile renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive but will be lower than the level attained in 2019. The Company expects that domestic Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes for 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in 2019. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal and many commercial property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium that the Company generates from outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd's, international renewal premium changes during 2020 could be somewhat higher, broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2019; however, the Company expects that international renewal premium changes for the first half of 2020 will remain positive and will be higher than the level attained in the same period of 2019.\n___________________________________________\nthat for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin and the underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2019. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that for 2020 in the aggregate, the underlying underwriting margin will be higher, and the underlying combined ratio will be lower, than in 2019. The improvements are expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses.\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: \nIncome tax expense in 2019 was $223 million, $36 million or 14% lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the $282 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2019, partially offset by (ii) the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Company's voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic pension plan in 2018.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, below investment grade securities comprised 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2019 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $152 million and a fair value of $146 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $6 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019 and accounted for approximately 21% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nSegment income in 2019 was $618 million, $175 million or 22% lower than segment income of $793 million in 2018. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 and 2018 was $65 million and $266 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2019 and 2018 were $5 million and $16 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected modestly higher loss estimates in the domestic general liability product line for management liability coverages. Income tax expense in 2019 was lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes.\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2019 were $10.96 billion, $792 million or 8% higher than in 2018, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher loss estimates in the general liability product line for primary and excess coverages and the commercial automobile product line and (iv) higher business volumes, partially offset by (v) lower catastrophe losses and (vi) lower loss estimates in the workers' compensation product line.\nSecurities Lending\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was $2.50 billion, $115 million or 5% higher than in 2018, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n \u2022 Shareholders' equity of $25.94 billion \nIn the home office and field office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims and net asbestos-related payments were comparable with 2018. Payments on behalf of policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.\n\n___________________________________________\nEarned Premiums\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables:\nOther Revenues\nSevere weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. The insurance industry experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, more people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion and an increase in the average size of a house. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. The frequency and severity of wildfire losses have been elevated in more recent years, due in part to record droughts in California that some climate studies suggest are likely to increase over time. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have expanded the Company's potential for losses from wildfires. Moreover, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions, inadequate reflection of regulatory changes and the other factors mentioned above. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events.\nInterest expense in 2019 and 2018 was $344 million and $352 million, respectively.\n (2) Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.  Net investment income in 2019 was $2.47 billion, comparable with 2018. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2019 was $2.07 billion, $90 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from a higher average level of fixed maturity investments and higher long-term interest rates. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2019 was $105 million, $13 million higher than in 2018, primarily resulting from higher short-term interest rates. Net investment income generated by the Company's remaining investment portfolios in 2019 was $333 million, $108 million lower than in 2018, primarily reflecting lower returns from private equity
