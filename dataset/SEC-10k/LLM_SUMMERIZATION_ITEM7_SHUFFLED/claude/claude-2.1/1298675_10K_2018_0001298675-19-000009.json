MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Report entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Report entitled Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated self-storage real estate company, and as such we have in-house capabilities in the operation, design, development, leasing, management, and acquisition of self-storage properties. The Parent Company's operations are conducted solely through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Parent Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we owned 493 and 484 self-storage properties, respectively, totaling approximately 34.6 million and 33.8 million rentable square feet, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we owned stores in the District of Columbia and the following 23 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we managed 593 stores for third parties (including 151 stores containing an aggregate of approximately 9.0 million net rentable square feet as part of five separate unconsolidated real estate ventures), bringing the total number of stores we owned and/or managed to 1,086. As of December 31, 2018, we managed stores for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 34 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\nWe derive revenues principally from rents received from customers who rent cubes at our self-storage properties under month-to-month leases. Therefore, our operating results depend materially on our ability to retain our existing customers and lease our available self-storage cubes to new customers while maintaining and, where possible, increasing our pricing levels. In addition, our operating results depend on the ability of our customers to make required rental payments to us. Our approach to the management and operation of our stores combines centralized marketing, revenue management, and other operational support with local operations teams that provide market-level oversight and control. We believe this approach allows us to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local market conditions, and to maximize revenues by managing rental rates and occupancy levels.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our stores, which are generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending and moving trends, as well as to increased bad debts due to recessionary pressures. Adverse economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products and services. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe continue our focus on maximizing internal growth opportunities and selectively pursuing targeted acquisitions and developments of self-storage properties.\nWe have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage, and acquire self-storage properties.\nOur self-storage properties are located in major metropolitan and suburban areas and have numerous customers per store. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. Our stores in Florida, New York, Texas, and California provided approximately 17%, 16%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). These policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from estimates calculated and utilized by management.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, and its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries. The portion of these entities not owned by the Company is presented as noncontrolling interests as of and during the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWhen the Company obtains an economic interest in an entity, the Company evaluates the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company considers the provisions of additional FASB guidance to determine whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. The Company consolidates (i) entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and (ii) entities that are non-VIEs which the Company controls and in which the limited partners do not have substantive participating rights, or the ability to dissolve the entity or remove the Company without cause.\nSelf-Storage Properties\nThe Company records self-storage properties at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on the buildings and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to 39 years. Expenditures for significant renovations or improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen stores are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. When a portfolio of stores is acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the individual stores based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual store along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. Allocations to the individual assets and liabilities are based upon comparable market sales information for land, buildings and improvements, and estimates of depreciated replacement cost of equipment.\nIn allocating the purchase price for an acquisition, the Company determines whether the acquisition includes intangible assets or liabilities. The Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributable to the value of in-place leases. This intangible asset is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of the respective leases. Substantially all of the leases in place at acquired stores are at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts. Accordingly, to date no portion of the purchase price has been allocated to above- or below-market lease intangibles. To date, no intangible asset has been recorded for the value of customer relationships, because the Company does not have any concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover is fairly frequent.\nLong-lived assets classified as held for use\u201d are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances such as declines in occupancy and operating results indicate that there may be an impairment. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is compared to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows, plus a terminal value, attributable to the assets to determine if the store's basis is recoverable. If a store's basis is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized in accordance with these procedures during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe Company considers long-lived assets to be held for sale\u201d upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (a) management commits to a plan to sell a store (or group of stores), (b) the store is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such stores, (c) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the store have been initiated, (d) the sale of the store is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (e) the store is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nTypically these criteria are all met when the relevant asset is under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the\ntransaction from closing. However, each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances. Stores classified as held for sale are reported at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nRevenue Recognition\nManagement has determined that all our leases with customers are operating leases. Rental income is recognized in accordance with the terms of the leases, which generally are month to month. Property management fee income is recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements.\nThe Company recognizes gains from sale of real estate in accordance with the guidance on transfer of nonfinancial assets. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits. Profit on real estate sold is recognized when a valid contract exists, the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the control of the property has transferred.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are noncontrolling interests. In accordance with authoritative guidance issued on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, such noncontrolling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity/capital, separately from the Parent Company's equity/capital. The guidance also requires that noncontrolling interests are adjusted each period so that the carrying value equals the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulation of historical cost or its redemption value. On the consolidated statements of operations, revenues, expenses, and net income or loss from less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amounts, including both the amounts attributable to the Parent Company and noncontrolling interests. Presentation of consolidated equity/capital activity is included for both quarterly and annual financial statements, including beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for shareholders' equity/capital, noncontrolling interests, and total equity/capital.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting when it is determined that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the venture. Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures are recorded initially at cost, as investments in real estate entities, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings (losses), cash contributions, less distributions and impairments. On a periodic basis, management also assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate entities may be other than temporarily impaired. An investment is impaired only if the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management, is less than the carrying value of the investment and the decline is other than temporary. To the extent impairment that is other than temporary has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third party appraisals. There were no impairment losses related to the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Parent Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code beginning with the period from October 21, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004. In management's opinion, the requirements to maintain these elections are being met. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements other than for operations conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.\nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in cost basis, the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation, and the allocation of net income and loss for financial versus tax reporting purposes.\nThe Parent Company is subject to a 4% federal excise tax if sufficient taxable income is not distributed within prescribed time limits. The excise tax equals 4% of the annual amount, if any, by which the sum of (a) 85% of the Parent Company's ordinary income, (b) 95% of the Parent Company's net capital gains, and (c) 100% of prior year taxable income exceeds cash distributions and certain taxes paid by the Parent Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-12 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the Company adopts the update. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2017, as part of the new revenue standard, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 - Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance, which focuses on recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers. Specifically, the new guidance defines in substance nonfinancial asset\u201d, unifies guidance related to partial sales of nonfinancial assets, eliminates rules specifically addressing sales of real estate, removes exceptions to the financial asset derecognition model, and clarifies the accounting for contributions of nonfinancial assets to joint ventures. The new guidance became effective on January 1, 2018 when the Company adopted the new revenue standard. Upon adoption, the majority of the Company's sale transactions are now treated as dispositions of nonfinancial assets rather than dispositions of a business given the FASB's recently revised definition of a business (see ASU No. 2017-01 below). Additionally, in partial sale transactions where the Company sells a controlling interest in real estate but retains a noncontrolling interest, the Company will now fully recognize a gain or loss on the fair value measurement of the retained interest as the new guidance eliminates the partial profit recognition model. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which changes the definition of a business to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. A framework is provided to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present. The new guidance also narrows the definition of outputs, which are defined as the results of inputs and substantive processes that provide goods or services to customers, other revenue, or investment income. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the majority of the Company's future property acquisitions will now be considered asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with these transactions and the allocation of purchase price and acquisition related costs to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires the statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The new guidance also requires entities to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The eight items that the ASU provides classification guidance on include (1) debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either financing or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use\nasset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, the date it became effective for public companies, using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classification. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient that allows reporting entities to use hindsight to determine the lease term for existing leases. The Company expects to record lease liabilities of approximately $55.0 million and right-of-use assets of approximately $50.0 million, primarily related to the Company's ten ground leases in which it serves as lessee.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new guidance outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends ASU No. 2014-09 and is intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders. ASU No. 2016-12 provides practical expedients on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and contract modifications and completed contracts in transition. Both standards became effective on January 1, 2018. The Company finalized the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-12 on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and adopted the standards using the modified retrospective transition method. The standards did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations primarily because most of its revenue is derived from lease contracts, which are excluded from the scope of the new guidance. The Company's insurance fee revenue, property management fee revenue, and merchandise sale revenue are included in the scope of the new guidance, however, the Company identified similar performance obligations under this standard as compared with deliverables and separate units of account identified under its previous revenue recognition methodology. Accordingly, revenue recognized under the new guidance does not differ materially from revenue recognized under previous guidance and there is no material prior year impact.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Historical results set forth in the consolidated statements of operations reflect only the existing stores for each period presented and should not be taken as indicative of future operations. We consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable years presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self-storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, developments or dispositions. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 456 same-store properties and 37 non same-store properties. All of the non same-store properties were 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, dispositions, developed stores, stores with a significant portion of net rentable square footage taken out of service, or stores that have not yet reached stabilization as defined above. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this Report.\nThe comparability of our results of operations is affected by the timing of acquisition and disposition activities during the periods reported. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we owned 493, 484, and 475 self-storage properties and related assets, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the change in number of owned stores from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance - January 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores developed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance - March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores developed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores combined (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance - June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores developed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance - September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores developed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores combined (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStores sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance - December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOn May 16, 2017, we acquired a store located in Sacramento, CA for approximately $3.7 million, which is located directly adjacent to an existing wholly-owned store.

The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 3.6% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2018 as compared to 2017. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $13.2 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nOther property related income increased from $55.0 million in 2017 to $60.2 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.4%. The $1.8 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation. The remainder of the increase is attributable to $1.4 million of additional other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio and $1.9 million resulting primarily from increased customer insurance participation at our managed stores.\nProperty management fee income increased from $14.9 million during 2017 to $20.3 million during 2018, an increase of $5.4 million, or 35.9%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (593 stores as of December 31, 2018 compared to 452 stores as of December 31, 2017).\nOperating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased from $181.5 million in 2017 to $196.9 million in 2018, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.5%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.2 million increase in costs associated with the growth in our third-party management program as well as system enhancements, a $5.1 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio primarily due to higher property taxes, payroll, and snow removal expenses, and $5.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired or developed stores.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $145.7 million in 2017 to $143.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 1.6%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $34.7 million in 2017 to $37.7 million in 2018, an increase of $3.0 million, or 8.5%. The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees, a charge associated with the settlement of a legal action, and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\nAcquisition related costs decreased $1.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 (see note 2), which now categorizes the majority of our property acquisitions as asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs.\nOther (expense) income\nInterest expense on loans increased from $57.0 million in 2017 to $62.1 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.1%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017, and higher interest rates during 2018. The average debt balance increased to $1.7 billion during 2018 as compared to $1.6 billion during 2017 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt increased from 3.79% during 2017 to 3.93% during 2018.\nGains from sale of real estate, net were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, with no comparable gains during the year ended December 31, 2017. These gains are determined on a transactional basis and, accordingly, are not comparable across reporting periods.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016

increase of $39.4 million, or 8.8%. The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy of 20 basis points and higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 4.3% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2017 as compared to 2016. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $20.1 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nOther property related income increased from $50.3 million in 2016 to $55.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 9.4%. The $1.4 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation and higher average occupancy. The remainder of the increase is attributable to other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nProperty management fee income increased from $10.2 million during 2016 to $14.9 million during 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 46.3%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (452 stores as of December 31, 2017 compared to 316 stores as of December 31, 2016).\nOperating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses increased from $165.8 million in 2016 to $181.5 million in 2017, an increase of $15.7 million, or 9.4%, which is primarily attributable to $7.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired stores, a $3.7 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio, primarily due to higher property tax expenses, and $0.9 million related to hurricane damage, net of expected insurance proceeds.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $161.9 million in 2016 to $145.7 million in 2017, a decrease of $16.2 million, or 10.0%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2016 and 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $32.8 million in 2016 to $34.7 million in 2017, an increase of $1.9 million, or 5.9%. The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\nAcquisition related costs decreased from $6.6 million during 2016 to $1.3 million during 2017, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 80.3%. Acquisition-related costs are non-recurring and fluctuate based on periodic investment activity.\nOther (expense) income\nInterest expense on loans increased from $50.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.6 million, or 13.0%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by lower interest rates during 2017. The average debt balance increased $199.4 million to $1.6 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.4 billion during 2016 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt decreased from 3.82% during 2016 to 3.79% during 2017.\nEquity in losses of real estate ventures fluctuated from a loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $1.3 million, or 47.9%. The change is mainly driven by our share of the losses attributable to HVP III, a real estate venture in which we own a 10% interest. The loss incurred in 2016 was primarily the result of amortization expense associated with the in-place lease intangible that was recorded in connection with HVP III's acquisition of 68 properties during 2015 and 2016. These assets became fully amortized during 2016 and 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNOI\nWe define net operating income, which we refer to as NOI, as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense - early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, income from discontinued operations, gains from disposition of discontinued operations, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of our stores, and for all of our stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nit is one of the primary measures used by our management and our store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of our stores, including our ability to lease our stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control our property operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nit is widely used in the real estate industry and the self-storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nit helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of our basis in our assets from our operating results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere are material limitations to using a measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our\nnet income. We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues and net income.\nFFO\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, as amended, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of our stores. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFFO, as adjusted\nFFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. We present FFO, as adjusted because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from FFO, as adjusted are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our FFO, as adjusted (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute FFO, as adjusted in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of FFO, as adjusted may not be comparable to FFO, as adjusted reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to the Company's common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n163,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n134,288\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd (deduct):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate depreciation and amortization:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,961\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompany's share of unconsolidated real estate ventures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,243\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGains from sale of real estate, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10,576)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,593\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFFO attributable to common shareholders and OP unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n305,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n289,085\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan procurement amortization expense -

Our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions and increased net operating income levels on the same-store portfolio in the 2018 period as compared to the 2017 period.\nCash used in investing activities increased from $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $322.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $172.0 million. The change was primarily driven by an increase in cash used for the acquisition of storage properties. Cash used during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the acquisition of ten stores for an aggregate purchase price of $227.5 million, inclusive of $7.2 million of assumed debt and $4.8 million of OP units issued, while cash used\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the acquisition of seven stores for an aggregate purchase price of $80.7 million, inclusive of $6.2 million of assumed debt and $12.3 million of OP units issued. The change was also driven by an $18.9 million increase in our investment in real estate ventures primarily due to $14.1 million used to fund the acquisition of twelve properties during 2018 by HVP IV and $5.0 million to fund our preferred investment in Capital Storage (see note 2). The remainder of the increase was primarily due to a $17.2 million increase in development costs resulting from the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in a previously consolidated joint venture offset by a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the sale of two stores during 2018 with no property sales in the 2017 period.\nCash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $143.3 million in 2017, a change of $158.6 million. This change was primarily the result of a $75.4 million net increase in revolving credit facility borrowings and a $102.2 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common shares during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. These cash inflows were offset by a $26.4 million increase in cash distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nA comparison of cash flow related to operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n291,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n263,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(150,303)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(559,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n408,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(143,319)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(362,730)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $291.9 million and $263.3 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $28.6 million.

The change is also driven by a decrease in cash used for development costs resulting from the acquisition of a development property by a consolidated joint venture for $67.2 million, inclusive of $35.0 million of assumed debt, during 2016.\nCash used in financing activities was $143.3 million in 2017 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $219.4 million in 2016, a change of $362.7 million. The change is primarily a result of $298.5 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in August 2016 compared to $103.2 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in April 2017. There was also a $106.5 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance and sale of common shares from 2016 to 2017 and a $100.0 million term loan repayment during April 2017 with no comparable repayment in the prior year. We also paid $77.6 million to redeem our 7.75% Series A Preferred shares in November 2016 with no similar transaction in 2017. Additionally, cash distributions paid to common shareholders, preferred shareholders, and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership increased $39.6 million from 2016 to 2017, resulting primarily from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Overview\nOur cash flow from operations has historically been one of our primary sources of liquidity used to fund debt service, distributions and capital expenditures. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers who lease space from us at our stores and fees earned from managing stores. Therefore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our customers. We believe that the properties in which we invest, self-storage properties, are less sensitive than other real\nestate product types to near-term economic downturns. However, prolonged economic downturns will adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders on an annual basis or pay federal income tax. The nature of our business, coupled with the requirement that we distribute a substantial portion of our income on an annual basis, will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term.\nOur short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our stores, refinancing of certain mortgage indebtedness, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on debt, expected distributions to limited partners and shareholders, capital expenditures, and the development of new stores. These funding requirements will vary from year to year, in some cases significantly. In the 2019 fiscal year, we expect recurring capital expenditures to be approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, planned capital improvements and store upgrades to be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million and costs associated with the development of new stores to be approximately $30.0 million to $45.0 million. After giving effect to the subsequent repayment of the $200.0 million outstanding indebtedness under the term loan portion of our Credit Facility in January 2019 (see Recent Developments\u201d), as of December 31, 2018, our remaining scheduled principal payments on debt are approximately $11.7 million in 2019.\nOur most restrictive financial covenants limit the amount of additional leverage we can add; however, we believe cash flows from operations, access to equity financing, including through our at-the-market\u201d equity program, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility provide adequate sources of liquidity to enable us to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our covenants.\nOur liquidity needs beyond 2019 consist primarily of contractual obligations which include repayments of indebtedness at maturity, as well as potential discretionary expenditures such as (i) non-recurring capital expenditures; (ii) redevelopment of operating stores; (iii) acquisitions of additional stores; and (iv) development of new stores. We will have to satisfy the portion of our needs not covered by cash flow from operations through additional borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company and common or preferred units of the Operating Partnership and/or cash generated through store dispositions and joint venture transactions.\nWe believe that, as a publicly traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot provide any assurance that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. In addition, dislocation in the United States debt markets may significantly reduce the availability and increase the cost of long-term debt capital, including conventional mortgage financing and commercial mortgage-backed securities financing. There can be no assurance that such capital will be readily available in the future. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.8 million in available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $303.8 million of availability for borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nOur unsecured senior notes are summarized as follows (collectively referred to as the Senior Notes\u201d):\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIssuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$250M 4.800% Guaranteed Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.82\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJun-12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJul-22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 4.375% Guaranteed Notes due 2023 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.33\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVarious (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec-23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 4.000% Guaranteed Notes due 2025 (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.99\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVarious (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNov-25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 3.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.18\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAug-16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSep-26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Discount on issuance of unsecured senior notes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(568)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(617)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Loan procurement costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,908)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,923)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal unsecured senior notes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,143,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,142,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOn April 4, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued $50.0 million of its 4.375% senior notes due 2023, which are part of the same series as the $250.0 million principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 4.375% senior notes due December 15, 2023 issued on December 17, 2013.

The indenture also restricts the ability of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to incur secured debt unless the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40% after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also contains other financial and customary covenants, including a covenant not to own unencumbered assets with a value less than 150% of the unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Operating Partnership was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Senior Notes.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans\nOn December 9, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on April 5, 2012, June 18, 2013, and April 22, 2015 to provide for, amongst other things, a $500.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a maturity date of April 22, 2020. Pricing on the Revolver is dependent on our unsecured debt credit ratings. At our current Baa2/BBB level, amounts drawn under the Revolver are priced at 1.25% over LIBOR, inclusive of a facility fee of 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, $303.8 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver. The available balance under the Revolver is reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, we also had a $200.0 million unsecured term loan outstanding under the Credit Facility, which is included in the table below.\nOn June 20, 2011, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement (the Term Loan Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on June 18, 2013 and August 5, 2014, consisting of a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a five-year maturity and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a seven-year maturity.

deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company considers the provisions of additional FASB guidance to determine whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. The Company consolidates (i) entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and (ii) entities that are non-VIEs which the Company controls and in which the limited partners do not have substantive participating rights, or the ability to dissolve the entity or remove the Company without cause.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIssuance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$250M 4.800% Guaranteed Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.82\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJun-12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJul-22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 4.375% Guaranteed Notes due 2023 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.33\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVarious (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec-23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 4.000% Guaranteed Notes due 2025 (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.99\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nVarious (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNov-25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$300M 3.125% Guaranteed Notes due 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.18\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAug-16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSep-26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal balance outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Discount on issuance of unsecured senior notes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(568)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(617)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Loan procurement costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,908)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,923)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal unsecured senior notes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,143,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,142,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoncontrolling interests are the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are noncontrolling interests. In accordance with authoritative guidance issued on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, such noncontrolling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity/capital, separately from the Parent Company's equity/capital. The guidance also requires that noncontrolling interests are adjusted each period so that the carrying value equals the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulation of historical cost or its redemption value. On the consolidated statements of operations, revenues, expenses, and net income or loss from less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amounts, including both the amounts attributable to the Parent Company and noncontrolling interests. Presentation of consolidated equity/capital activity is included for both quarterly and annual financial statements, including beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for shareholders' equity/capital, noncontrolling interests, and total equity/capital.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending and moving trends, as well as to increased bad debts due to recessionary pressures. Adverse economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products and services. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelected Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStorage properties, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,600,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,408,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelected Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n195,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisition related costs decreased from $6.6 million during 2016 to $1.3 million during 2017, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 80.3%.

However, we cannot provide any assurance that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. In addition, dislocation in the United States debt markets may significantly reduce the availability and increase the cost of long-term debt capital, including conventional mortgage financing and commercial mortgage-backed securities financing. There can be no assurance that such capital will be readily available in the future. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nTable 117: <table>

The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees, a charge associated with the settlement of a legal action, and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEquity in losses of real estate ventures fluctuated from a loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $1.3 million, or 47.9%. The change is mainly driven by our share of the losses attributable to HVP III, a real estate venture in which we own a 10% interest. The loss incurred in 2016 was primarily the result of amortization expense associated with the in-place lease intangible that was recorded in connection with HVP III's acquisition of 68 properties during 2015 and 2016. These assets became fully amortized during 2016 and 2017.\nOur self-storage properties are located in major metropolitan and suburban areas and have numerous customers per store. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. Our stores in Florida, New York, Texas, and California provided approximately 17%, 16%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u00b7 it is one of the primary measures used by our management and our store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of our stores, including our ability to lease our stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control our property operating expenses; \nOur most restrictive financial covenants limit the amount of additional leverage we can add; however, we believe cash flows from operations, access to equity financing, including through our at-the-market\u201d equity program, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility provide adequate sources of liquidity to enable us to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our covenants.\nWe define net operating income, which we refer to as NOI, as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense - early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, income from discontinued operations, gains from disposition of discontinued operations, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our stores, which are generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity.\n\nOther property related income increased from $55.0 million in 2017 to $60.2 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.4%. The $1.8 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation. The remainder of the increase is attributable to $1.4 million of additional other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio and $1.9 million resulting primarily from increased customer insurance participation at our managed stores.\nRedemption of Preferred Shares\nStorage properties, net of accumulated depreciation, increased $192.2 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of ten storage properties, additions and improvements to storage properties, and development costs incurred during the year.\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Represents the weighted average occupancy for the period. \nLiquidity Overview\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the acquisition of seven stores for an aggregate purchase price of $80.7 million, inclusive of $6.2 million of assumed debt and $12.3 million of OP units issued. The change was also driven by an $18.9 million increase in our investment in real estate ventures primarily due to $14.1 million used to fund the acquisition of twelve properties during 2018 by HVP IV and $5.0 million to fund our preferred investment in Capital Storage (see note 2). The remainder of the increase was primarily due to a $17.2 million increase in development costs resulting from the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in a previously consolidated joint venture offset by a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the sale of two stores during 2018 with no property sales in the 2017 period.\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, as amended, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n \u00b7 Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00; and \nOperating Expenses\nA comparison of cash flow related to operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe continue our focus on maximizing internal growth opportunities and selectively pursuing targeted acquisitions and developments of self-storage properties.\n\nRevolving credit facility increased $113.8 million primarily as a result of borrowings used to fund the acquisition of ten storage properties, additions and improvements to storage properties, and development costs incurred during the year.\n\nOur liquidity needs beyond 2019 consist primarily of contractual obligations which include repayments of indebtedness at maturity, as well as potential discretionary expenditures such as (i) non-recurring capital expenditures; (ii) redevelopment of operating stores; (iii) acquisitions of additional stores; and (iv) development of new stores. We will have to satisfy the portion of our needs not covered by cash flow from operations through additional borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company and common or preferred units of the Operating Partnership and/or cash generated through store dispositions and joint venture transactions.\n (2) On January 31, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes (see Recent Developments\u201d) to repay all of the $200.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. We expect to satisfy all other contractual obligations owed in 2019 through a combination of cash generated from operations and from draws on the revolving portion of our Credit Facility. \n (1) Pricing on the Term Loan Facility and the unsecured term loan under the Credit Facility is dependent on our unsecured debt credit ratings. At our current Baa2/BBB level, amounts drawn under the term loan that matured in January 2019 were priced at 1.30% over LIBOR, while amounts drawn under the term loan scheduled to mature in January 2020 are priced at 1.15% over LIBOR. As of December 31, 2018, borrowings under the Credit Facility, inclusive of the Revolver, and Term Loan Facility, as amended, had an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.75%. \nIncome Taxes\nFFO\nCash used in investing activities was $150.3 million in 2017 and $559.3 million in 2016, a decrease of $409.0 million driven by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of self-storage properties. Cash used during 2017 related to the acquisition of seven stores for an aggregate purchase price of $80.7 million, inclusive of $6.2 million of assumed debt and $12.3 million of OP units issued, while cash used in investing activities during 2016 related to the acquisition of 28 stores for an aggregate purchase price of $403.6 million, inclusive of $6.5 million of assumed debt. The change is also driven by a decrease in cash used for development costs resulting from the acquisition of a development property by a consolidated joint venture for $67.2 million, inclusive of $35.0 million of assumed debt, during 2016.\nWe use NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of our stores, and for all of our stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTypically these criteria are all met when the relevant asset is under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the\nThe Term Loan Facility and the unsecured term loan under the Credit Facility were fully drawn as of December 31, 2018 and no further borrowings may be made under the term loans. Our ability to borrow under the Revolver is subject to ongoing compliance with certain financial covenants which include:\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our stores, refinancing of certain mortgage indebtedness, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on debt, expected distributions to limited partners and shareholders, capital expenditures, and the development of new stores. These funding requirements will vary from year to year, in some cases significantly. In the 2019 fiscal year, we expect recurring capital expenditures to be approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, planned capital improvements and store upgrades to be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million and costs associated with the development of new stores to be approximately $30.0 million to $45.0 million. After giving effect to the subsequent repayment of the $200.0 million outstanding indebtedness under the term loan portion of our Credit Facility in January 2019 (see Recent Developments\u201d), as of December 31, 2018, our remaining scheduled principal payments on debt are approximately $11.7 million in 2019.\nOn December 9, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on April 5, 2012, June 18, 2013, and April 22, 2015 to provide for, amongst other things, a $500.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a maturity date of April 22, 2020. Pricing on the Revolver is dependent on our unsecured debt credit ratings. At our current Baa2/BBB level, amounts drawn under the Revolver are priced at 1.25% over LIBOR, inclusive of a facility fee of 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, $303.8 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver. The available balance under the Revolver is reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, we also had a $200.0 million unsecured term loan outstanding under the Credit Facility, which is included in the table below.\nWe are an integrated self-storage real estate company, and as such we have in-house capabilities in the operation, design, development, leasing, management, and acquisition of self-storage properties. The Parent Company's operations are conducted solely through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Parent Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we owned 493 and 484 self-storage properties, respectively, totaling approximately 34.6 million and 33.8 million rentable square feet, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we owned stores in the District of Columbia and the following 23 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we managed 593 stores for third parties (including 151 stores containing an aggregate of approximately 9.0 million net rentable square feet as part of five separate unconsolidated real estate ventures), bringing the total number of stores we owned and/or managed to 1,086. As of December 31, 2018, we managed stores for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 34 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Historical results set forth in the consolidated statements of operations reflect only the existing stores for each period presented and should not be taken as indicative of future operations. We consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable years presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self-storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, developments or dispositions. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 456 same-store properties and 37 non same-store properties. All of the non same-store properties were 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, dispositions, developed stores, stores with a significant portion of net rentable square footage taken out of service, or stores that have not yet reached stabilization as defined above. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this Report.\nProperty operating expenses increased from $165.8 million in 2016 to $181.5 million in 2017, an increase of $15.7 million, or 9.4%, which is primarily attributable to $7.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired stores, a $3.7 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio, primarily due to higher property tax expenses, and $0.9 million related to hurricane damage, net of expected insurance proceeds.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company records self-storage properties at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on the buildings and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to 39 years. Expenditures for significant renovations or improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new guidance outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends ASU No. 2014-09 and is intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders. ASU No. 2016-12 provides practical expedients on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and contract modifications and completed contracts in transition. Both standards became effective on January 1, 2018. The Company finalized the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-12 on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and adopted the standards using the modified retrospective transition method. The standards did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations primarily because most of its revenue is derived from lease contracts, which are excluded from the scope of the new guidance. The Company's insurance fee revenue, property management fee revenue, and merchandise sale revenue are included in the scope of the new guidance, however, the Company identified similar performance obligations under this standard as compared with deliverables and separate units of account identified under its previous revenue recognition methodology. Accordingly, revenue recognized under the new guidance does not differ materially from revenue recognized under previous guidance and there is no material prior year impact.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires the statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The new guidance also requires entities to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nOverview\nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in cost basis, the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation, and the allocation of net income and loss for financial versus tax reporting purposes.\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands)\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-12 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the Company adopts the update. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n (1) Represents occupancy as of December 31 of the respective year. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which changes the definition of a business to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. A framework is provided to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present. The new guidance also narrows the definition of outputs, which are defined as the results of inputs and substantive processes that provide goods or services to customers, other revenue, or investment income. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the majority of the Company's future property acquisitions will now be considered asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with these transactions and the allocation of purchase price and acquisition related costs to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n (2) Represents the weighted average occupancy for the period. \nFFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. We present FFO, as adjusted because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from FFO, as adjusted are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our FFO, as adjusted (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute FFO, as adjusted in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of FFO, as adjusted may not be comparable to FFO, as adjusted reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nestate product types to near-term economic downturns. However, prolonged economic downturns will adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nNOI\n (2) On January 31, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029 (see Recent Developments\u201d) to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). These policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from estimates calculated and utilized by management.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders on an annual basis or pay federal income tax. The nature of our business, coupled with the requirement that we distribute a substantial portion of our income on an annual basis, will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term.\nIn February 2017, as part of the new revenue standard, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 - Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance, which focuses on recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers. Specifically, the new guidance defines in substance nonfinancial asset\u201d, unifies guidance related to partial sales of nonfinancial assets, eliminates rules specifically addressing sales of real estate, removes exceptions to the financial asset derecognition model, and clarifies the accounting for contributions of nonfinancial assets to joint ventures. The new guidance became effective on January 1, 2018 when the Company adopted the new revenue standard. Upon adoption, the majority of the Company's sale transactions are now treated as dispositions of nonfinancial assets rather than dispositions of a business given the FASB's recently revised definition of a business (see ASU No. 2017-01 below). Additionally, in partial sale transactions where the Company sells a controlling interest in real estate but retains a noncontrolling interest, the Company will now fully recognize a gain or loss on the fair value measurement of the retained interest as the new guidance eliminates the partial profit recognition model. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nRevenues\nManagement has determined that all our leases with customers are operating leases. Rental income is recognized in accordance with the terms of the leases, which generally are month to month. Property management fee income is recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements.\n\nProperty management fee income increased from $10.2 million during 2016 to $14.9 million during 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 46.3%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (452 stores as of December 31, 2017 compared to 316 stores as of December 31, 2016).\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting when it is determined that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the venture. Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures are recorded initially at cost, as investments in real estate entities, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings (losses), cash contributions, less distributions and impairments. On a periodic basis, management also assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate entities may be other than temporarily impaired. An investment is impaired only if the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management, is less than the carrying value of the investment and the decline is other than temporary. To the extent impairment that is other than temporary has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third party appraisals. There were no impairment losses related to the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans\nFurther, under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, we are restricted from paying distributions on the Parent Company's common shares in excess of the greater of (i) 95% of funds from operations, and (ii) such amount as may be necessary to maintain the Parent Company's REIT status.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we anticipate being in compliance with all of our financial covenants through the terms of the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.8 million in available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $303.8 million of availability for borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn January 30, 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2029 which bear interest at a rate of 4.375% per annum (the 2029 Notes\u201d). The 2029 Notes were priced at 99.356% of the principal amount to yield 4.455% to maturity. Net proceeds from the offering of $345.5 million were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our $200.0 million unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. The remaining proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver.\n\nThe Parent Company is subject to a 4% federal excise tax if sufficient taxable income is not distributed within prescribed time limits. The excise tax equals 4% of the annual amount, if any, by which the sum of (a) 85% of the Parent Company's ordinary income, (b) 95% of the Parent Company's net capital gains, and (c) 100% of prior year taxable income exceeds cash distributions and certain taxes paid by the Parent Company.\nasset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, the date it became effective for public companies, using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classification. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient that allows reporting entities to use hindsight to determine the lease term for existing leases. The Company expects to record lease liabilities of approximately $55.0 million and right-of-use assets of approximately $50.0 million, primarily related to the Company's ten ground leases in which it serves as lessee.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $145.7 million in 2017 to $143.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 1.6%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2017.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nOperating Expenses\n\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed.\nCash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $143.3 million in 2017, a change of $158.6 million. This change was primarily the result of a $75.4 million net increase in revolving credit facility borrowings and a $102.2 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common shares during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. These cash inflows were offset by a $26.4 million increase in cash distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\n\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the\n (1) Loss related to settlement of legal action for the year ended December 31, 2018, represents a charge related to a preliminary settlement agreement for a class action alleging violations of a state specific deceptive and unfair trade practices act. \nInterest expense on loans increased from $57.0 million in 2017 to $62.1 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.1%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017, and higher interest rates during 2018. The average debt balance increased to $1.7 billion during 2018 as compared to $1.6 billion during 2017 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt increased from 3.79% during 2017 to 3.93% during 2018.\nFFO, as adjusted\nIn allocating the purchase price for an acquisition, the Company determines whether the acquisition includes intangible assets or liabilities. The Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributable to the value of in-place leases. This intangible asset is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of the respective leases. Substantially all of the leases in place at acquired stores are at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts. Accordingly, to date no portion of the purchase price has been allocated to above- or below-market lease intangibles. To date, no intangible asset has been recorded for the value of customer relationships, because the Company does not have any concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover is fairly frequent.\nProperty management fee income increased from $14.9 million during 2017 to $20.3 million during 2018, an increase of $5.4 million, or 35.9%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (593 stores as of December 31, 2018 compared to 452 stores as of December 31, 2017).\n (1) On May 16, 2017, we acquired a store located in Sacramento, CA for approximately $3.7 million, which is located directly adjacent to an existing wholly-owned store. Given their proximity to each other, the stores have been combined in our store count, as well as for operational and reporting purposes. \nOn June 20, 2011, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement (the Term Loan Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on June 18, 2013 and August 5, 2014, consisting of a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a five-year maturity and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a seven-year maturity. On April 6, 2017, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of $50.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due 2023 and $50.0 million of our 4.000% Senior Notes due 2025 to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our five-year $100.0 million unsecured term loan that was scheduled to mature in June 2018.\ntransaction from closing. However, each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances. Stores classified as held for sale are reported at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nRecent Developments\nWe used proceeds from sales of common shares under the program during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 to fund acquisitions of storage properties and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 10.5 million common shares, 4.7 million common shares, and 5.8 million common shares, respectively, remained available for issuance under the Equity Distribution Agreements.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, and its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries. The portion of these entities not owned by the Company is presented as noncontrolling interests as of and during the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResults of Operations\n (1) On April 4, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued $50.0 million of its 4.375% senior notes due 2023, which are part of the same series as the $250.0 million principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 4.375% senior notes due December 15, 2023 issued on December 17, 2013. The $50.0 million and $250.0 million tranches were priced at 105.040% and 98.995%, respectively, of the principal amount to yield 3.495% and 4.501%, respectively, to maturity. The combined weighted-average effective interest rate of the 2023 notes is 4.330%. \nOther assets, net increased $14.2 million primarily due to a $6.4 million net increase in our in-place lease intangibles resulting from the acquisition of nine operating storage properties during the year. The increase is also a result of our $5.0 million investment made in exchange for 100% of the Class A Preferred Units of Capital Storage Partners, LLC, a newly formed venture that acquired 22 storage properties located in Florida (4), Oklahoma (5), and Texas (13) (see note 2).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (2) On April 4, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued $50.0 million of its 4.000% senior notes due 2025, which are part of the same series as the $250.0 million principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 4.000% senior notes due November 15, 2025 issued on October 26, 2015. The $50.0 million and $250.0 million tranches were priced at 101.343% and 99.735%, respectively, of the principal amount to yield 3.811% and 4.032%, respectively, to maturity. The combined weighted-average effective interest rate of the 2025 notes is 3.994%. \nnet income. We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues and net income.\nOther (expense) income\nInterest expense on loans increased from $50.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.6 million, or 13.0%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by lower interest rates during 2017. The average debt balance increased $199.4 million to $1.6 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.4 billion during 2016 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt decreased from 3.82% during 2016 to 3.79% during 2017.\nA comparison of cash flow related to operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nOur unsecured term loans under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility are summarized below:\n \u00b7 it helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of our basis in our assets from our operating results. \nLong-lived assets classified as held for use\u201d are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances such as declines in occupancy and operating results indicate that there may be an impairment. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is compared to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows, plus a terminal value, attributable to the assets to determine if the store's basis is recoverable. If a store's basis is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized in accordance with these procedures during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage, and acquire self-storage properties.\nManagement uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of our stores. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nRental income increased from $449.6 million during 2016 to $489.0 million during 2017, an increase of $39.4 million, or 8.8%. The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy of 20 basis points and higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 4.3% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2017 as compared to 2016. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $20.1 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $304.3 million and $291.9 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $12.4 million. Our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions and increased net operating income levels on the same-store portfolio in the 2018 period as compared to the 2017 period.\nGains from sale of real estate, net were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, with no comparable gains during the year ended December 31, 2017. These gains are determined on a transactional basis and, accordingly, are not comparable across reporting periods.\nOur unsecured senior notes are summarized as follows (collectively referred to as the Senior Notes\u201d):\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $291.9 million and $263.3 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $28.6 million. Our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions and increased net operating income levels on the same-store portfolio in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Minimum tangible net worth of $821,211,200 plus 75% of net proceeds from equity issuances after June 30, 2010. \nWe derive revenues principally from rents received from customers who rent cubes at our self-storage properties under month-to-month leases. Therefore, our operating results depend materially on our ability to retain our existing customers and lease our available self-storage cubes to new customers while maintaining and, where possible, increasing our pricing levels. In addition, our operating results depend on the ability of our customers to make required rental payments to us. Our approach to the management and operation of our stores combines centralized marketing, revenue management, and other operational support with local operations teams that provide market-level oversight and control. We believe this approach allows us to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local market conditions, and to maximize revenues by managing rental rates and occupancy levels.\nProperty operating expenses increased from $181.5 million in 2017 to $196.9 million in 2018, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.5%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.2 million increase in costs associated with the growth in our third-party management program as well as system enhancements, a $5.1 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio primarily due to higher property taxes, payroll, and snow removal expenses, and $5.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired or developed stores.\nOther property related income increased from $50.3 million in 2016 to $55.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 9.4%. The $1.4 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation and higher average occupancy. The remainder of the increase is attributable to other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Report entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Report entitled Risk Factors\u201d.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe comparability of our results of operations is affected by the timing of acquisition and disposition activities during the periods reported. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we owned 493, 484, and 475 self-storage properties and related assets, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nAcquisition related costs decreased $1.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 (see note 2), which now categorizes the majority of our property acquisitions as asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs.\nOther Material Changes in Financial Position\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $32.8 million in 2016 to $34.7 million in 2017, an increase of $1.9 million, or 5.9%. The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\n \u00b7 it is widely used in the real estate industry and the self-storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and \n (3) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. \nCash used in financing activities was $143.3 million in 2017 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $219.4 million in 2016, a change of $362.7 million. The change is primarily a result of $298.5 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in August 2016 compared to $103.2 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in April 2017. There was also a $106.5 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance and sale of common shares from 2016 to 2017 and a $100.0 million term loan repayment during April 2017 with no comparable repayment in the prior year. We also paid $77.6 million to redeem our 7.75% Series A Preferred shares in November 2016 with no similar transaction in 2017. Additionally, cash distributions paid to common shareholders, preferred shareholders, and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership increased $39.6 million from 2016 to 2017, resulting primarily from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nOur cash flow from operations has historically been one of our primary sources of liquidity used to fund debt service, distributions and capital expenditures. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers who lease space from us at our stores and fees earned from managing stores. Therefore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our customers. We believe that the properties in which we invest, self-storage properties, are less sensitive than other real\n (3) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. \nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $161.9 million in 2016 to $145.7 million in 2017, a decrease of $16.2 million, or 10.0%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2016 and 2017.\nWhen stores are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. When a portfolio of stores is acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the individual stores based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual store along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. Allocations to the individual assets and liabilities are based upon comparable market sales information for land, buildings and improvements, and estimates of depreciated replacement cost of equipment.\n (2) Property damage related to hurricanes, net of expected insurance proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $0.1 million of storm damage related costs that are included in the Company's share of equity in losses of real estate ventures. \n (1) Represents occupancy as of December 31 of the respective year. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The eight items that the ASU provides classification guidance on include (1) debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nThe Parent Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code beginning with the period from October 21, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004. In management's opinion, the requirements to maintain these elections are being met. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements other than for operations conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.\nWe maintain an at-the-market equity program that enables us to offer and sell up to 50.0 million common shares through sales agents pursuant to equity distribution agreements (the Equity Distribution Agreements\u201d). Our sales activity under the program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is summarized below:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either financing or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use\nRevenues\nThe following table summarizes the change in number of owned stores from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018:\nOther (expense) income\nRental income increased from $489.0 million during 2017 to $517.5 million during 2018, an increase of $28.5 million, or 5.8%. The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 3.6% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2018 as compared to 2017. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $13.2 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio.", "item_7_text": "The Company recognizes gains from sale of real estate in accordance with the guidance on transfer of nonfinancial assets. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits. Profit on real estate sold is recognized when a valid contract exists, the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the control of the property has transferred.\nOn November 2, 2016, we completed the redemption of all of our 3,100,000 outstanding shares of 7.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a cash redemption price of $25.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The redemption price of $77.5 million was paid by the Company from available cash balances. In connection with the redemption, we recognized a charge of $2.9 million related to excess redemption costs over the original net proceeds.\nIssuance of Common Shares\nThere are material limitations to using a measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our\n (2) On October 2, 2017, we acquired a store located in Keller, TX for approximately $4.1 million, which is located directly adjacent to an existing wholly-owned store. Given their proximity to each other, the stores have been combined in our store count, as well as for operational and reporting purposes. \nSelf-Storage Properties\nCash used in investing activities increased from $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $322.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $172.0 million. The change was primarily driven by an increase in cash used for the acquisition of storage properties. Cash used during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the acquisition of ten stores for an aggregate purchase price of $227.5 million, inclusive of $7.2 million of assumed debt and $4.8 million of OP units issued, while cash used\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands)\n \u00b7 Maximum total indebtedness to total asset value of 60.0% at any time; \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\n (1) Amounts do not include unamortized fair value adjustments for discounts/premiums and loan procurement costs. \nWhen the Company obtains an economic interest in an entity, the Company evaluates the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company considers the provisions of additional FASB guidance to determine whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. The Company consolidates (i) entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and (ii) entities that are non-VIEs which the Company controls and in which the limited partners do not have substantive participating rights, or the ability to dissolve the entity or remove the Company without cause.\nNoncontrolling interests are the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are noncontrolling interests. In accordance with authoritative guidance issued on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, such noncontrolling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity/capital, separately from the Parent Company's equity/capital. The guidance also requires that noncontrolling interests are adjusted each period so that the carrying value equals the greater of its carrying value based on the accumulation of historical cost or its redemption value. On the consolidated statements of operations, revenues, expenses, and net income or loss from less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amounts, including both the amounts attributable to the Parent Company and noncontrolling interests. Presentation of consolidated equity/capital activity is included for both quarterly and annual financial statements, including beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for shareholders' equity/capital, noncontrolling interests, and total equity/capital.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending and moving trends, as well as to increased bad debts due to recessionary pressures. Adverse economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products and services. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nAcquisition related costs decreased from $6.6 million during 2016 to $1.3 million during 2017, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 80.3%. Acquisition-related costs are non-recurring and fluctuate based on periodic investment activity.\nWe believe that, as a publicly traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot provide any assurance that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. In addition, dislocation in the United States debt markets may significantly reduce the availability and increase the cost of long-term debt capital, including conventional mortgage financing and commercial mortgage-backed securities financing. There can be no assurance that such capital will be readily available in the future. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nThe Company considers long-lived assets to be held for sale\u201d upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (a) management commits to a plan to sell a store (or group of stores), (b) the store is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such stores, (c) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the store have been initiated, (d) the sale of the store is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (e) the store is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nCash Flows\nThe indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued restricts the ability of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to incur debt unless the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a leverage ratio not to exceed 60% and an interest coverage ratio of more than 1.5:1 after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also restricts the ability of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to incur secured debt unless the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40% after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also contains other financial and customary covenants, including a covenant not to own unencumbered assets with a value less than 150% of the unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Operating Partnership was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Senior Notes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $34.7 million in 2017 to $37.7 million in 2018, an increase of $3.0 million, or 8.5%. The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees, a charge associated with the settlement of a legal action, and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEquity in losses of real estate ventures fluctuated from a loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $1.3 million, or 47.9%. The change is mainly driven by our share of the losses attributable to HVP III, a real estate venture in which we own a 10% interest. The loss incurred in 2016 was primarily the result of amortization expense associated with the in-place lease intangible that was recorded in connection with HVP III's acquisition of 68 properties during 2015 and 2016. These assets became fully amortized during 2016 and 2017.\nOur self-storage properties are located in major metropolitan and suburban areas and have numerous customers per store. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. Our stores in Florida, New York, Texas, and California provided approximately 17%, 16%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u00b7 it is one of the primary measures used by our management and our store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of our stores, including our ability to lease our stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control our property operating expenses; \nOur most restrictive financial covenants limit the amount of additional leverage we can add; however, we believe cash flows from operations, access to equity financing, including through our at-the-market\u201d equity program, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility provide adequate sources of liquidity to enable us to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our covenants.\nWe define net operating income, which we refer to as NOI, as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense - early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, income from discontinued operations, gains from disposition of discontinued operations, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe typically experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our stores, which are generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity.\n\nOther property related income increased from $55.0 million in 2017 to $60.2 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.4%. The $1.8 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation. The remainder of the increase is attributable to $1.4 million of additional other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio and $1.9 million resulting primarily from increased customer insurance participation at our managed stores.\nRedemption of Preferred Shares\nStorage properties, net of accumulated depreciation, increased $192.2 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of ten storage properties, additions and improvements to storage properties, and development costs incurred during the year.\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Represents the weighted average occupancy for the period. \nLiquidity Overview\nduring the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the acquisition of seven stores for an aggregate purchase price of $80.7 million, inclusive of $6.2 million of assumed debt and $12.3 million of OP units issued. The change was also driven by an $18.9 million increase in our investment in real estate ventures primarily due to $14.1 million used to fund the acquisition of twelve properties during 2018 by HVP IV and $5.0 million to fund our preferred investment in Capital Storage (see note 2). The remainder of the increase was primarily due to a $17.2 million increase in development costs resulting from the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in a previously consolidated joint venture offset by a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the sale of two stores during 2018 with no property sales in the 2017 period.\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, as amended, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n \u00b7 Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00; and \nOperating Expenses\nA comparison of cash flow related to operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe continue our focus on maximizing internal growth opportunities and selectively pursuing targeted acquisitions and developments of self-storage properties.\n\nRevolving credit facility increased $113.8 million primarily as a result of borrowings used to fund the acquisition of ten storage properties, additions and improvements to storage properties, and development costs incurred during the year.\n\nOur liquidity needs beyond 2019 consist primarily of contractual obligations which include repayments of indebtedness at maturity, as well as potential discretionary expenditures such as (i) non-recurring capital expenditures; (ii) redevelopment of operating stores; (iii) acquisitions of additional stores; and (iv) development of new stores. We will have to satisfy the portion of our needs not covered by cash flow from operations through additional borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company and common or preferred units of the Operating Partnership and/or cash generated through store dispositions and joint venture transactions.\n (2) On January 31, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes (see Recent Developments\u201d) to repay all of the $200.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. We expect to satisfy all other contractual obligations owed in 2019 through a combination of cash generated from operations and from draws on the revolving portion of our Credit Facility. \n (1) Pricing on the Term Loan Facility and the unsecured term loan under the Credit Facility is dependent on our unsecured debt credit ratings. At our current Baa2/BBB level, amounts drawn under the term loan that matured in January 2019 were priced at 1.30% over LIBOR, while amounts drawn under the term loan scheduled to mature in January 2020 are priced at 1.15% over LIBOR. As of December 31, 2018, borrowings under the Credit Facility, inclusive of the Revolver, and Term Loan Facility, as amended, had an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.75%. \nIncome Taxes\nFFO\nCash used in investing activities was $150.3 million in 2017 and $559.3 million in 2016, a decrease of $409.0 million driven by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of self-storage properties. Cash used during 2017 related to the acquisition of seven stores for an aggregate purchase price of $80.7 million, inclusive of $6.2 million of assumed debt and $12.3 million of OP units issued, while cash used in investing activities during 2016 related to the acquisition of 28 stores for an aggregate purchase price of $403.6 million, inclusive of $6.5 million of assumed debt. The change is also driven by a decrease in cash used for development costs resulting from the acquisition of a development property by a consolidated joint venture for $67.2 million, inclusive of $35.0 million of assumed debt, during 2016.\nWe use NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of our stores, and for all of our stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTypically these criteria are all met when the relevant asset is under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the\nThe Term Loan Facility and the unsecured term loan under the Credit Facility were fully drawn as of December 31, 2018 and no further borrowings may be made under the term loans. Our ability to borrow under the Revolver is subject to ongoing compliance with certain financial covenants which include:\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our stores, refinancing of certain mortgage indebtedness, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on debt, expected distributions to limited partners and shareholders, capital expenditures, and the development of new stores. These funding requirements will vary from year to year, in some cases significantly. In the 2019 fiscal year, we expect recurring capital expenditures to be approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, planned capital improvements and store upgrades to be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million and costs associated with the development of new stores to be approximately $30.0 million to $45.0 million. After giving effect to the subsequent repayment of the $200.0 million outstanding indebtedness under the term loan portion of our Credit Facility in January 2019 (see Recent Developments\u201d), as of December 31, 2018, our remaining scheduled principal payments on debt are approximately $11.7 million in 2019.\nOn December 9, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on April 5, 2012, June 18, 2013, and April 22, 2015 to provide for, amongst other things, a $500.0 million unsecured revolving facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a maturity date of April 22, 2020. Pricing on the Revolver is dependent on our unsecured debt credit ratings. At our current Baa2/BBB level, amounts drawn under the Revolver are priced at 1.25% over LIBOR, inclusive of a facility fee of 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, $303.8 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver. The available balance under the Revolver is reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, we also had a $200.0 million unsecured term loan outstanding under the Credit Facility, which is included in the table below.\nWe are an integrated self-storage real estate company, and as such we have in-house capabilities in the operation, design, development, leasing, management, and acquisition of self-storage properties. The Parent Company's operations are conducted solely through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Parent Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we owned 493 and 484 self-storage properties, respectively, totaling approximately 34.6 million and 33.8 million rentable square feet, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we owned stores in the District of Columbia and the following 23 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we managed 593 stores for third parties (including 151 stores containing an aggregate of approximately 9.0 million net rentable square feet as part of five separate unconsolidated real estate ventures), bringing the total number of stores we owned and/or managed to 1,086. As of December 31, 2018, we managed stores for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 34 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Historical results set forth in the consolidated statements of operations reflect only the existing stores for each period presented and should not be taken as indicative of future operations. We consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable years presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self-storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, developments or dispositions. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 456 same-store properties and 37 non same-store properties. All of the non same-store properties were 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, dispositions, developed stores, stores with a significant portion of net rentable square footage taken out of service, or stores that have not yet reached stabilization as defined above. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this Report.\nProperty operating expenses increased from $165.8 million in 2016 to $181.5 million in 2017, an increase of $15.7 million, or 9.4%, which is primarily attributable to $7.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired stores, a $3.7 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio, primarily due to higher property tax expenses, and $0.9 million related to hurricane damage, net of expected insurance proceeds.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company records self-storage properties at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on the buildings and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to 39 years. Expenditures for significant renovations or improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new guidance outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends ASU No. 2014-09 and is intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders. ASU No. 2016-12 provides practical expedients on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and contract modifications and completed contracts in transition. Both standards became effective on January 1, 2018. The Company finalized the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-12 on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and adopted the standards using the modified retrospective transition method. The standards did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations primarily because most of its revenue is derived from lease contracts, which are excluded from the scope of the new guidance. The Company's insurance fee revenue, property management fee revenue, and merchandise sale revenue are included in the scope of the new guidance, however, the Company identified similar performance obligations under this standard as compared with deliverables and separate units of account identified under its previous revenue recognition methodology. Accordingly, revenue recognized under the new guidance does not differ materially from revenue recognized under previous guidance and there is no material prior year impact.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires the statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The new guidance also requires entities to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nOverview\nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in cost basis, the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation, and the allocation of net income and loss for financial versus tax reporting purposes.\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands)\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-12 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company's financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities. The transition guidance provides companies with the option of early adopting the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method in any interim period after issuance of the update, or alternatively requires adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This adoption method will require the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the Company adopts the update. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n (1) Represents occupancy as of December 31 of the respective year. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which changes the definition of a business to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. A framework is provided to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present. The new guidance also narrows the definition of outputs, which are defined as the results of inputs and substantive processes that provide goods or services to customers, other revenue, or investment income. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the majority of the Company's future property acquisitions will now be considered asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs incurred in connection with these transactions and the allocation of purchase price and acquisition related costs to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n (2) Represents the weighted average occupancy for the period. \nFFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. We present FFO, as adjusted because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from FFO, as adjusted are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our FFO, as adjusted (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute FFO, as adjusted in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of FFO, as adjusted may not be comparable to FFO, as adjusted reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nestate product types to near-term economic downturns. However, prolonged economic downturns will adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nNOI\n (2) On January 31, 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029 (see Recent Developments\u201d) to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). These policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from estimates calculated and utilized by management.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders on an annual basis or pay federal income tax. The nature of our business, coupled with the requirement that we distribute a substantial portion of our income on an annual basis, will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term.\nIn February 2017, as part of the new revenue standard, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05 - Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance, which focuses on recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with non-customers. Specifically, the new guidance defines in substance nonfinancial asset\u201d, unifies guidance related to partial sales of nonfinancial assets, eliminates rules specifically addressing sales of real estate, removes exceptions to the financial asset derecognition model, and clarifies the accounting for contributions of nonfinancial assets to joint ventures. The new guidance became effective on January 1, 2018 when the Company adopted the new revenue standard. Upon adoption, the majority of the Company's sale transactions are now treated as dispositions of nonfinancial assets rather than dispositions of a business given the FASB's recently revised definition of a business (see ASU No. 2017-01 below). Additionally, in partial sale transactions where the Company sells a controlling interest in real estate but retains a noncontrolling interest, the Company will now fully recognize a gain or loss on the fair value measurement of the retained interest as the new guidance eliminates the partial profit recognition model. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nRevenues\nManagement has determined that all our leases with customers are operating leases. Rental income is recognized in accordance with the terms of the leases, which generally are month to month. Property management fee income is recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements.\n\nProperty management fee income increased from $10.2 million during 2016 to $14.9 million during 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 46.3%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (452 stores as of December 31, 2017 compared to 316 stores as of December 31, 2016).\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting when it is determined that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the venture. Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures are recorded initially at cost, as investments in real estate entities, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings (losses), cash contributions, less distributions and impairments. On a periodic basis, management also assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate entities may be other than temporarily impaired. An investment is impaired only if the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management, is less than the carrying value of the investment and the decline is other than temporary. To the extent impairment that is other than temporary has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third party appraisals. There were no impairment losses related to the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans\nFurther, under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, we are restricted from paying distributions on the Parent Company's common shares in excess of the greater of (i) 95% of funds from operations, and (ii) such amount as may be necessary to maintain the Parent Company's REIT status.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we anticipate being in compliance with all of our financial covenants through the terms of the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.8 million in available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately $303.8 million of availability for borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn January 30, 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2029 which bear interest at a rate of 4.375% per annum (the 2029 Notes\u201d). The 2029 Notes were priced at 99.356% of the principal amount to yield 4.455% to maturity. Net proceeds from the offering of $345.5 million were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our $200.0 million unsecured term loan portion of the Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2019. The remaining proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver.\n\nThe Parent Company is subject to a 4% federal excise tax if sufficient taxable income is not distributed within prescribed time limits. The excise tax equals 4% of the annual amount, if any, by which the sum of (a) 85% of the Parent Company's ordinary income, (b) 95% of the Parent Company's net capital gains, and (c) 100% of prior year taxable income exceeds cash distributions and certain taxes paid by the Parent Company.\nasset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, the date it became effective for public companies, using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classification. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient that allows reporting entities to use hindsight to determine the lease term for existing leases. The Company expects to record lease liabilities of approximately $55.0 million and right-of-use assets of approximately $50.0 million, primarily related to the Company's ten ground leases in which it serves as lessee.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $145.7 million in 2017 to $143.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 1.6%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2017.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nOperating Expenses\n\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our co-investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed.\nCash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $143.3 million in 2017, a change of $158.6 million. This change was primarily the result of a $75.4 million net increase in revolving credit facility borrowings and a $102.2 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common shares during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. These cash inflows were offset by a $26.4 million increase in cash distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\n\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this Report. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the\n (1) Loss related to settlement of legal action for the year ended December 31, 2018, represents a charge related to a preliminary settlement agreement for a class action alleging violations of a state specific deceptive and unfair trade practices act. \nInterest expense on loans increased from $57.0 million in 2017 to $62.1 million in 2018, an increase of $5.2 million, or 9.1%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017, and higher interest rates during 2018. The average debt balance increased to $1.7 billion during 2018 as compared to $1.6 billion during 2017 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt increased from 3.79% during 2017 to 3.93% during 2018.\nFFO, as adjusted\nIn allocating the purchase price for an acquisition, the Company determines whether the acquisition includes intangible assets or liabilities. The Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributable to the value of in-place leases. This intangible asset is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of the respective leases. Substantially all of the leases in place at acquired stores are at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts. Accordingly, to date no portion of the purchase price has been allocated to above- or below-market lease intangibles. To date, no intangible asset has been recorded for the value of customer relationships, because the Company does not have any concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover is fairly frequent.\nProperty management fee income increased from $14.9 million during 2017 to $20.3 million during 2018, an increase of $5.4 million, or 35.9%. This increase is attributable to an increase in management fees related to the third-party management business resulting from more stores under management and higher revenue at managed stores (593 stores as of December 31, 2018 compared to 452 stores as of December 31, 2017).\n (1) On May 16, 2017, we acquired a store located in Sacramento, CA for approximately $3.7 million, which is located directly adjacent to an existing wholly-owned store. Given their proximity to each other, the stores have been combined in our store count, as well as for operational and reporting purposes. \nOn June 20, 2011, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement (the Term Loan Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on June 18, 2013 and August 5, 2014, consisting of a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a five-year maturity and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan with a seven-year maturity. On April 6, 2017, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of $50.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due 2023 and $50.0 million of our 4.000% Senior Notes due 2025 to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our five-year $100.0 million unsecured term loan that was scheduled to mature in June 2018.\ntransaction from closing. However, each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances. Stores classified as held for sale are reported at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nRecent Developments\nWe used proceeds from sales of common shares under the program during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 to fund acquisitions of storage properties and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 10.5 million common shares, 4.7 million common shares, and 5.8 million common shares, respectively, remained available for issuance under the Equity Distribution Agreements.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, and its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries. The portion of these entities not owned by the Company is presented as noncontrolling interests as of and during the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResults of Operations\n (1) On April 4, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued $50.0 million of its 4.375% senior notes due 2023, which are part of the same series as the $250.0 million principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 4.375% senior notes due December 15, 2023 issued on December 17, 2013. The $50.0 million and $250.0 million tranches were priced at 105.040% and 98.995%, respectively, of the principal amount to yield 3.495% and 4.501%, respectively, to maturity. The combined weighted-average effective interest rate of the 2023 notes is 4.330%. \nOther assets, net increased $14.2 million primarily due to a $6.4 million net increase in our in-place lease intangibles resulting from the acquisition of nine operating storage properties during the year. The increase is also a result of our $5.0 million investment made in exchange for 100% of the Class A Preferred Units of Capital Storage Partners, LLC, a newly formed venture that acquired 22 storage properties located in Florida (4), Oklahoma (5), and Texas (13) (see note 2).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (2) On April 4, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued $50.0 million of its 4.000% senior notes due 2025, which are part of the same series as the $250.0 million principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 4.000% senior notes due November 15, 2025 issued on October 26, 2015. The $50.0 million and $250.0 million tranches were priced at 101.343% and 99.735%, respectively, of the principal amount to yield 3.811% and 4.032%, respectively, to maturity. The combined weighted-average effective interest rate of the 2025 notes is 3.994%. \nnet income. We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues and net income.\nOther (expense) income\nInterest expense on loans increased from $50.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $57.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.6 million, or 13.0%. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt during 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by lower interest rates during 2017. The average debt balance increased $199.4 million to $1.6 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.4 billion during 2016 as the result of borrowings to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition activity. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt decreased from 3.82% during 2016 to 3.79% during 2017.\nA comparison of cash flow related to operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nOur unsecured term loans under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility are summarized below:\n \u00b7 it helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of our basis in our assets from our operating results. \nLong-lived assets classified as held for use\u201d are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances such as declines in occupancy and operating results indicate that there may be an impairment. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is compared to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows, plus a terminal value, attributable to the assets to determine if the store's basis is recoverable. If a store's basis is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized in accordance with these procedures during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage, and acquire self-storage properties.\nManagement uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of our stores. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nRental income increased from $449.6 million during 2016 to $489.0 million during 2017, an increase of $39.4 million, or 8.8%. The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy of 20 basis points and higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 4.3% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2017 as compared to 2016. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $20.1 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $304.3 million and $291.9 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $12.4 million. Our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions and increased net operating income levels on the same-store portfolio in the 2018 period as compared to the 2017 period.\nGains from sale of real estate, net were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, with no comparable gains during the year ended December 31, 2017. These gains are determined on a transactional basis and, accordingly, are not comparable across reporting periods.\nOur unsecured senior notes are summarized as follows (collectively referred to as the Senior Notes\u201d):\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $291.9 million and $263.3 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $28.6 million. Our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions and increased net operating income levels on the same-store portfolio in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 Minimum tangible net worth of $821,211,200 plus 75% of net proceeds from equity issuances after June 30, 2010. \nWe derive revenues principally from rents received from customers who rent cubes at our self-storage properties under month-to-month leases. Therefore, our operating results depend materially on our ability to retain our existing customers and lease our available self-storage cubes to new customers while maintaining and, where possible, increasing our pricing levels. In addition, our operating results depend on the ability of our customers to make required rental payments to us. Our approach to the management and operation of our stores combines centralized marketing, revenue management, and other operational support with local operations teams that provide market-level oversight and control. We believe this approach allows us to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local market conditions, and to maximize revenues by managing rental rates and occupancy levels.\nProperty operating expenses increased from $181.5 million in 2017 to $196.9 million in 2018, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.5%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.2 million increase in costs associated with the growth in our third-party management program as well as system enhancements, a $5.1 million increase in property operating expenses on the same-store portfolio primarily due to higher property taxes, payroll, and snow removal expenses, and $5.0 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired or developed stores.\nOther property related income increased from $50.3 million in 2016 to $55.0 million in 2017, an increase of $4.7 million, or 9.4%. The $1.4 million increase in same-store other property related income is mainly attributable to increased customer insurance participation and higher average occupancy. The remainder of the increase is attributable to other property related income derived from the stores acquired or opened in 2016 and 2017 included in our non same-store portfolio.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Report entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Report entitled Risk Factors\u201d.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe comparability of our results of operations is affected by the timing of acquisition and disposition activities during the periods reported. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we owned 493, 484, and 475 self-storage properties and related assets, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nAcquisition related costs decreased $1.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2018 (see note 2), which now categorizes the majority of our property acquisitions as asset acquisitions, resulting in the capitalization of acquisition related costs.\nOther Material Changes in Financial Position\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $32.8 million in 2016 to $34.7 million in 2017, an increase of $1.9 million, or 5.9%. The change is primarily attributable to increased professional fees and payroll expenses resulting from additional employee headcount to support our growth.\n \u00b7 it is widely used in the real estate industry and the self-storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and \n (3) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. \nCash used in financing activities was $143.3 million in 2017 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $219.4 million in 2016, a change of $362.7 million. The change is primarily a result of $298.5 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in August 2016 compared to $103.2 million of net proceeds from our issuance of unsecured senior notes in April 2017. There was also a $106.5 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance and sale of common shares from 2016 to 2017 and a $100.0 million term loan repayment during April 2017 with no comparable repayment in the prior year. We also paid $77.6 million to redeem our 7.75% Series A Preferred shares in November 2016 with no similar transaction in 2017. Additionally, cash distributions paid to common shareholders, preferred shareholders, and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership increased $39.6 million from 2016 to 2017, resulting primarily from the increase in the common dividend per share and number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nOur cash flow from operations has historically been one of our primary sources of liquidity used to fund debt service, distributions and capital expenditures. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers who lease space from us at our stores and fees earned from managing stores. Therefore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our customers. We believe that the properties in which we invest, self-storage properties, are less sensitive than other real\n (3) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. \nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $161.9 million in 2016 to $145.7 million in 2017, a decrease of $16.2 million, or 10.0%. This decrease is primarily attributable to five-year assets acquired as part of the Company's property acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 that became fully depreciated during 2016 and 2017.\nWhen stores are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. When a portfolio of stores is acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the individual stores based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual store along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. Allocations to the individual assets and liabilities are based upon comparable market sales information for land, buildings and improvements, and estimates of depreciated replacement cost of equipment.\n (2) Property damage related to hurricanes, net of expected insurance proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $0.1 million of storm damage related costs that are included in the Company's share of equity in losses of real estate ventures. \n (1) Represents occupancy as of December 31 of the respective year. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The eight items that the ASU provides classification guidance on include (1) debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investments, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The standard became effective on January 1, 2018 and requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the update primarily relates to financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nThe Parent Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code beginning with the period from October 21, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004. In management's opinion, the requirements to maintain these elections are being met. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements other than for operations conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.\nWe maintain an at-the-market equity program that enables us to offer and sell up to 50.0 million common shares through sales agents pursuant to equity distribution agreements (the Equity Distribution Agreements\u201d). Our sales activity under the program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is summarized below:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either financing or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use\nRevenues\nThe following table summarizes the change in number of owned stores from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018:\nOther (expense) income\nRental income increased from $489.0 million during 2017 to $517.5 million during 2018, an increase of $28.5 million, or 5.8%. The increase in same-store rental income was primarily due to higher rental rates. Realized annual rent per square foot on our same-store portfolio increased 3.6% as a result of higher rates for new and existing customers during 2018 as compared to 2017. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to $13.2 million of additional income from the stores acquired in 2017 and 2018 included in our non same-store portfolio.", "item_7_tables": "Table
