MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends.\nOverview\nUnited Online, through its operating subsidiaries, provides consumer services and products over the Internet under a number of brands, including NetZero, Juno, MyPoints, StayFriends, and Trombi.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, we modified how we report segment information to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") as the information regularly reviewed by the CODM had changed. As a result of the changes, we now report three operating segments to the CODM, including the Communications segment, as well as separately reporting the operating results of the Commerce & Loyalty and Social Media segments (which, in prior periods, were reported to the CODM together as the Content & Media segment). This change has been reflected through a retroactive revision of prior-period segment information to conform to the newly-defined segment information.\nOn August 11, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Classmates, Inc. to Intelius Holdings, Inc. The purchase price received for the Classmates domestic business unit was $30.6 million in cash. The Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale included customary representations, warranties and covenants of each party, some of which survive the closing of the transaction for a period of time. Accordingly, the results of operations, the financial condition and the cash flows of the Classmates domestic business unit have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOur three reportable segments consist of the following:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Segment\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Services and Products </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Internet access services and devices, including dial-up, mobile broadband, DSL, email, Internet security, and web hosting </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commerce & Loyalty\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Loyalty marketing service, shopping through online portals, apps and browser extensions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Social Media\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Social networking services and products\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate revenues from three primary sources:\n\u2022 Services revenues. Services revenues in our Communications and Social Media segments are derived from selling subscriptions to consumers, who are typically billed in advance for the entire subscription term.\n\u2022 Products revenues. Products revenues in our Communications segment are derived from the sale of mobile broadband devices, as well as the related shipping and handling fees. Products revenues in our Social Media segment are derived from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees.\n\u2022 Advertising and other revenues. Advertising and other revenues are primarily derived from various advertising, marketing and media-related initiatives in all of our segments. Advertising and other revenues in our Commerce & Loyalty segment also include fees generated when members complete online transactions, when emails are transmitted to members and when members respond to emails and revenues from the sale of physical gift cards and electronic gift codes.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our businesses, and to develop forecasts and budgets. These key measures include the following:\nPay Accounts. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from our pay accounts, which represent one of the most important drivers of our business model. A pay account is defined as a member who has paid for a subscription to a Communications or Social Media service, and whose subscription has not terminated or expired. A subscription provides the member with access to our service for a specific term (for example, a month or a year) and may be renewed upon the expiration of each term. One-time purchases of our services, with the exception of our free and prepaid mobile broadband service, are not considered subscriptions and thus, are not included in the pay accounts metric. A pay account does not equate to a unique subscriber because one subscriber could have several pay accounts. In addition, at any point in time, our pay account base includes customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and have been inactive for 90 days or less, as well as a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool, such as the subscribers receiving our free mobile broadband service, and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect. In general, the key business metrics that affect our revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and the average monthly revenue per pay account. A pay account generally becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription.\nARPU. We monitor average monthly revenue per pay account (\"ARPU\"), which is calculated by dividing services revenues generated from the pay accounts of our Communications or Social Media segment, as applicable, for a period (after translation into U.S. Dollars) by the average number of\nsegment pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and the end of a period. ARPU may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which promotional, discounted or retention pricing is used to attract new, or retain existing, paying subscribers; changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans; increases or decreases in the price of our services; the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period; and for the Social Media segment, the average foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro.\nChurn. To evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base, we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire, which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate. Our average monthly churn rate for a period is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. Our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms, which affects the timing of subscription expirations, and other factors. We make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions. For our Communications segment, our churn calculation does not include accounts canceled during the first 30 days of service other than dial-up accounts that have upgraded from free accounts, but the calculation does include customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and, at any time during the period, reached 90 consecutive days of inactivity. A number of such accounts nevertheless will be included in our pay account totals at any given measurement date. Subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have canceled a pay account depending on the services and, as such, our segment churn rates are not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers canceling any particular service.\nActive Accounts. We monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base. Communications segment active accounts include all Communications segment pay accounts as of the date presented combined with the number of free dial-up Internet access and email accounts that logged on to our services at least once during the preceding 31 days. Social Media segment active accounts are defined as the sum of all pay accounts as of the date presented; and the monthly average for the period of all free accounts who have visited our social networking websites at least once during the period. Segment active accounts for six-month, nine-month and annual periods are calculated as a simple average of the quarterly active accounts for each respective segment.\nIn general, we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers. Users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently. We do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier. As a result, total active accounts may not represent total unique users.\nThe pay accounts, churn and ARPU metrics for the Communications segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the number of mobile broadband pay accounts, which have a higher churn rate and ARPU.\nThe pay accounts and ARPU metrics for the Social Media segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which discounted pricing is offered in prior and current periods, and the churn rate.\nGross Merchandise Sales. Gross merchandise sales is the total dollar value of Commerce & Loyalty member purchases during the reporting period, excluding applicable taxes and net of refunds, directly on the MyPoints site, on third-party sites accessed through the MyPoints portal, or on other Commerce & Loyalty properties. We include the purchases and refunds that are reported by our\npartners on or before the 15th calendar day following the end of the reporting period, to allow our partners to report purchases completed within the reporting period. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of member engagement with our Commerce & Loyalty properties.\nThe following table sets forth our key business metrics:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>

Assumptions\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and with the instructions for the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters, the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605, Revenue Recognition, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). ASC 605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, no significant Company obligations remain, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues exclude sales taxes collected.\nOur revenues are comprised of services revenues, which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts; advertising and other revenues; and products revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees; the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees; and from the sale of third-party merchandise.\nService revenues for our Communications services and social networking services are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts and are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer. Our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card, PayPal, automated clearinghouse, or check, and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period. Advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. We offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain Communications pay service plans. These alternative payment methods currently include payment by money order or payment through a local telephone company. In circumstances where payment is not received in advance, revenues are only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured.\nAdvertising revenues from our Communications services and from our social networking services consist primarily of amounts from our Internet search provider that are generated as a result of users utilizing such provider's Internet search services, amounts generated from display advertisements, and amounts generated from referring members to third-party websites or services. We recognize such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a written contract is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a customer-specific agreement. We assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction. The reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of our internally-tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and, when available, to third-party or customer-provided performance data.\nAdvertising and other revenues for our loyalty marketing service consist primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members, when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions. Each of these activities is a discrete, independent activity, which generally is specified in the agreement with each advertising customer. As the earning activities take place, activity measurement data (examples include the number of emails delivered and the number of responses received) is accumulated and the related revenues are recorded. Our loyalty marketing service also generates revenues from the sale of gift cards.\nOur Communications products revenues are generated from the sale of mobile broadband service devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees, and are recognized upon delivery of such devices as this is considered a separate earnings process from the sale of Communications services. Sales of mobile broadband service devices bundled with free service plans and paid service plans, and activation fees, are allocated using the relative selling price method in accordance with the multiple-element arrangement provisions of ASC 605. The selling prices of our\nmobile broadband paid service plans are determined by vendor specific objective evidence, which is based upon the monthly stand-alone selling price of each plan. The selling prices of the mobile broadband service devices and free service plans are determined by management's best estimate of selling price, which considers market and economic conditions, internal costs, pricing, and discounting practices. The revenues allocated to the free service plans are recognized ratably over the service period. Activation fees received upfront in excess of the amount allocated to mobile broadband devices are deferred and recognized as services revenues over the estimated service period.\nOur social networking products revenues are derived from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees. Products revenues from the sale of yearbooks are recognized upon delivery to the customer. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues. Shipping costs are included in cost of revenues.\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collectibility becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which among other things, addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units. The determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally includes a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is typically determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach is weighted at 75%, unless a meaningful base of market data is unavailable, in which case, the market approach is not used.\nWe operate three reportable segments, in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and we have identified three reporting units-Communications, MyPoints and Social Media-for purposes of evaluating goodwill. These reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. The goodwill related to our acquired businesses is specific to each reporting unit and the goodwill amounts are assigned as such.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step quantitative process. However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step quantitative impairment test is required or chosen, the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nWe performed the annual quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of our Communications and Social Media reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The fair value of our MyPoints reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill, by approximately 22%. Accordingly, the second step was not required for any of our reporting units.\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. The determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. Based on our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 for our MyPoints reporting unit, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate or a 1,000 basis point increase or decrease in the weighting of the market approach, with a corresponding decrease or increase in the weighting of the income approach, would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessment are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and, if applicable, the impairment amount.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe account for identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, shifts in technology, loss of key management or other personnel, significant negative industry or economic trends, changes in our operating model or strategy, and competitive forces. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on either a\nstraight-line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nMember Redemption Liability\nMember redemption liability for loyalty marketing service points represents the estimated costs associated with the obligation of MyPoints to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its loyalty marketing service members, less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption. The estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues, except for the portion related to member acquisition activities, internal marketing surveys and other non-revenue generating activities, which are presented in sales and marketing expenses. The member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points, less an allowance for points expected to expire, and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds.\nMyPoints members may redeem points for third-party gift cards and other rewards. Members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by MyPoints, purchase goods or services from advertisers, engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers, or engage in other specified activities.\nThe member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted-average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future. The weighted-average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed. MyPoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members. The discounts and points needed to redeem awards vary by merchant and award denomination. MyPoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards.\nMyPoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members. This reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point-earning trends, redemption activities and individual member account activity. MyPoints' historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members' accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer, less an estimated reactivation rate, plus an estimate for future cancelations of points that have not yet been outstanding for 180 days. Changes in, among other factors, the net number of points issued, redemption activities and members' activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at December 31, 2015 by approximately $51,000.\nPoints in active MyPoints accounts do not expire; however, unredeemed points expire after 12 consecutive months of inactivity. For purposes of the member redemption liability, \"inactive\" means a lack of all of the following: email response; survey completion; profile update; and any point-earning or point-redeeming transaction. The canceling or disabling of inactive MyPoints accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as we fully consider inactive MyPoints accounts when establishing the member redemption liability, as discussed above.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, a reconciliation of the changes in the member redemption liability (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,647 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,927 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accruals for points earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reduction for redeemed points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,988 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,805 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in allowance for points expected to expire and weighted-average cost of points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(990 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,103 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations. We record liabilities related to pending matters when an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss. As additional information becomes available, we continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters.\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nRevenues\nServices Revenues\nCommunications services revenues consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for dial-up Internet access, mobile broadband, DSL, email, Internet security, web hosting, voice services, and other services. Social Media services revenues primarily consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for social networking services. Our Communications and Social Media services revenues are primarily dependent on two factors: the average number of pay accounts for a period and ARPU. In general, we charge our pay accounts in advance of providing a service, which results in the deferral of services revenue to the period in which the services are provided. Communications services revenues also include revenues generated from the resale of telecommunications to third parties.\nProducts Revenues\nCommunications products revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of mobile broadband devices to our mobile broadband customers and to our retail partners and from the sale of\nmobile phones, as well as the related shipping and handling fees. Social Media products revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees, and from reselling third-party merchandise.\nAdvertising and Other Revenues\nOur Communications services generate advertising revenues from search placements, display advertisements and online market research associated with our Internet access and email services. Advertising revenues also include intercompany commissions from the Commerce & Loyalty segment which are included in reported segment results and are eliminated upon consolidation.\nWe provide advertising opportunities to marketers with both brand and direct response objectives through a full suite of display, search, email, and text-link opportunities across our various properties. Our social networking services generate advertising revenues primarily from display advertisements on our websites. Advertising inventory on our social networking websites includes text and graphic placements on the user home page, profile page, class list page, and most other pages on our websites. Our loyalty marketing service's advertising and other revenues are derived from advertising fees, consisting primarily of fees based on performance measures, that are generated when emails are transmitted to members, when members respond to emails, when members complete online transactions, and when members engage in a variety of other online activities, including, but not limited to, games, Internet searches and market research surveys. Our loyalty marketing service's advertising and other revenues also include revenues generated from the sale of physical and electronic gift cards.\nCost of Revenues\nCommunications cost of revenues includes telecommunications and data center costs; personnel and overhead-related costs associated with operating our networks and data centers; depreciation of network computers and equipment; license fees; costs related to providing customer support; costs related to customer billing and billing support for our pay accounts; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; domain name registration fees; and the costs associated with the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related shipping and handling costs.\nCommerce & Loyalty cost of revenues includes costs of points earned by members of our loyalty marketing service; costs related to the sale of gift cards; depreciation of network computers and equipment; data center costs; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; costs related to providing customer support; personnel-related costs; and costs related to third-party merchandise.\nSocial Media cost of revenues includes depreciation of network computers and equipment; data center costs; amortization of content purchases; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; costs related to providing customer support; personnel and overhead-related costs; costs associated with the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling costs; license fees; and domain name registration fees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses include expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products and with generating advertising revenues. Expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products include advertising and promotion expenses; fees paid to distribution partners, third-party advertising networks and co-registration partners to acquire new pay and free accounts; personnel and overhead-related expenses for marketing, merchandising, customer service, and sales personnel; and telemarketing costs incurred to acquire and retain pay accounts and up-sell pay accounts to additional services. Expenses associated with generating advertising revenues include sales\ncommissions and personnel-related expenses. We have expended significant amounts on sales and marketing, including branding and customer acquisition campaigns consisting of television, Internet, public relations, sponsorships, print, and outdoor advertising, and on retail and other performance-based distribution relationships. Marketing and advertising costs to promote our services and products are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses include media, agency and promotion expenses. Media production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is run. Media and agency costs are expensed over the period the advertising runs.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expenses include expenses for product development, maintenance of existing software, technology and websites, and development of new or improved software and technology, including personnel-related expenses for our technology group in various locations. Costs incurred by us to manage and monitor our technology and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses, which include unallocated corporate expenses, consist of personnel-related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, internal audit, investor relations, internal customer support personnel and personnel associated with operating our corporate network systems. In addition, general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees for legal, accounting and financial services; insurance; occupancy and other overhead-related costs; office relocation costs; non-income taxes; gains and losses on the sale of assets; bad debt expense; and reserves or expenses incurred as a result of settlements, judgments, fines, penalties, assessment, or other resolutions related to litigation, arbitration, investigations, disputes, or similar matters. General and administrative expenses also include expenses resulting from actual or potential transactions such as business combinations, mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, spin offs, financing transactions, and other strategic transactions, including, without limitation, expenses for advisors and representatives such as investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, and accounting firms.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of acquired pay accounts and free accounts; certain acquired trademarks and trade names; acquired rights, content and intellectual property; and other acquired identifiable intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nRestructuring and other exit costs consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations and other employee termination events. Restructuring and other exit costs include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring and other exit cost liabilities in accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest incurred related to tax and other regulatory filings.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, consists of gains and losses on foreign currency exchange rate transactions; realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts; gains or losses related to ineffectiveness of certain derivative instruments; and other non-operating income and expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected historical consolidated statements of operations and segment information data, which should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, and

The decrease was primarily driven by:\n\u2022 an $8.0 million unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to a $6.4 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service accrued in a prior period and paid in 2015; a $1.0 million unfavorable change in personnel-related cost liabilities due to our restructuring initiatives; a $0.9 million separation settlement with a former executive officer accrued in 2014 and paid in 2015; and an unfavorable change in accrued costs related to our Communications services. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes in income taxes payable and accrued legal fees;\n\u2022 a $4.7 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to income taxes receivable; a receivable recorded from a supplier related to our mobile broadband service; a $0.7 million receivable recorded in connection with the sale of our former Classmates domestic business unit; and an unfavorable change in other receivables;\n\u2022 a $3.4 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable primarily due to declines in advertising revenues;\n\u2022 a $2.9 million unfavorable change in inventories due to an increase in gift card inventory held at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, driven by increased gift card sales for our Commerce & Loyalty segment;\n\u2022 a $3.2 million favorable change due to an increase in income from continuing operations, net of non-cash reconciling items;\n\u2022 a $1.7 million favorable change in member redemption liability primarily due to a decline in online loyalty marketing revenues in 2014 and an increase in such revenues in 2015; and\n\u2022 a $1.3 million favorable change in other liabilities primarily due to a decrease, in 2014, in reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations decreased by $2.3 million, or 30% primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $5.7 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $0.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of property and equipment that was not yet paid for and was included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the range of $4.0 million to $5.0 million, which includes the aforementioned $0.2 million of purchases on account at December 31, 2015. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, which are difficult to predict. Technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.7 million, or 196%. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and a $1.1 million decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nFuture cash flows from financing activities may be affected by our repurchases of shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the \"Program\") that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately-negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors. Our Board of Directors has approved and ratified the Program through December 31, 2015, which date was recently extended by the Board of Directors (in December 2015) to December 31, 2018. There were no repurchases under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013 and, at December 31, 2015, the authorization remaining under the Program was $80.0 million.\nCash flows from financing activities may also be impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units we grant to employees. In general, we currently do not collect the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes from employees upon vesting of restricted stock units. Instead, we automatically withhold, from the restricted stock units that vest, the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due. We then pay the minimum statutory withholding taxes in cash. The withholding of these shares, although accounted for as a common stock repurchase, does not reduce the amount available under the Program. Similar to repurchases of common stock under the Program, the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities. The amounts remitted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $1.7 million, $2.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for which we withheld 0.1 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the restricted stock units that vested. The amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price and the number of applicable restricted stock units vesting during the period.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which may result in restructuring. Although restructuring efforts may reduce expenses and generate improved operating efficiencies, there can be no assurances that our restructuring efforts will be successful. In addition, past restructuring activities may not be a good indication of future restructuring opportunities, and any restructuring of our businesses may leave us with reduced financial and marketing resources to develop products and services to compete against our competitors. We recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, which\nconsisted of employee termination costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $1.5 million of restructuring and other exit costs. At December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.1 million, which will be paid within 12 months.\nBased on our current projections, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations, at least for the next 12 months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property.\nIn March 2015, we reached an audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and, in connection with such settlement, we remitted $6.4 million to the Internal Revenue Service in the quarter ended June 30, 2015, for which we had previously established a reserve. Additionally, as discussed in Note 12, \"Contingencies-Legal Matters\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Classmates, Inc. cooperated with a Multistate Work Group of Attorneys General in connection with their investigations of our former post-transaction sales practices and certain other current or former business practices. In May 2015, Classmates, Inc. executed settlement agreements with each member of the Multistate Work Group, and in July 2015, we remitted $8.2 million in connection with the settlements, which was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations. In October 2015, we received insurance proceeds in the amount of $4.2 million related to the Multistate Work Group inquiry and accompanying legal fees. Of this amount, $2.8 million was allocated to United Online, Inc., which was included in cash flows from discontinued operations, and $1.4 million was allocated to FTD, which was remitted to FTD in October 2015.\nIf we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to pay future dividends and our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $4.2 million, or 30%. The increase was primarily driven by:\n\u2022 an $8.1 million favorable change due to an increase in income from continuing operations, net of non-cash reconciling items;\n\u2022 a $5.6 million favorable change in accounts receivable due to a decline in Communications advertising revenues, as well as a decline in Commerce & Loyalty revenues in 2014 primarily as a result of our restructuring initiatives in the year ended December 31, 2014;\n\u2022 a $1.0 million favorable change in inventories due to a $3.1 million favorable change from our Communications segment as a result of a decrease in mobile broadband device inventory in the year ended December 31, 2014, coupled with an increase in inventory in the year ended December 31, 2013. These favorable changes were significantly offset by a $2.1 million unfavorable change from our Commerce & Loyalty segment due to a slight gift card inventory decrease in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $2.2 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2013;\n\u2022 a $5.1 million unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to a $6.2 million tax accrual established in 2013 for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, and the timing of payments;\n\u2022 a $3.2 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to a $2.8 million unfavorable change in income taxes receivable;\n\u2022 a $1.8 million unfavorable change in other liabilities due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions in the year ended December 31, 2014; and\n\u2022 a $0.6 million unfavorable change in member redemption liability primarily due to a decline in Commerce & Loyalty revenues in 2014 as a result of restructuring initiatives in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.2 million, or 39%. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in proceeds from sales of investments.\nNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations decreased by $24.7 million, or 95%. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was due to a $31.0 million decrease in payments of dividends and dividend equivalents on nonvested restricted stock units and a $1.5 million decrease in repurchase of common stock. These decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in proceeds from exercises of stock options, a $1.6 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock purchase plans, and a $1.1 million decrease in excess tax benefits from equity awards.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 Year to\nLess than\n3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 Years to\nLess than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Member redemption liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,103 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,215 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,580 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncancelable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>32,036 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,463 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,475 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,273 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,825 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $4.8 million, of which $1.3 million was included in other liabilities in the contractual obligations table above and, at December 31, 2015, was expected to be due in less than one year.

For example, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser of our former Classmates domestic business unit for certain liabilities and have retained responsibility for certain legal proceedings relating to the Classmates domestic business unit. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. We have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities, including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers and employees, and former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies, in certain circumstances.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

The determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally includes a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is typically determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach is weighted at 75%, unless a meaningful base of market data is unavailable, in which case, the market approach is not used.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to pay future dividends and our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions.

These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline segment operations and increase profitability.\nThe increase in Communications revenues consisted primarily of a $2.7 million increase in products revenues driven by the sale of mobile broadband devices from higher signups and lower discounting on devices. The increase in Communications services revenues was due to an $11.3 million increase in mobile broadband services revenues driven by the increase in the number of mobile broadband subscribers, largely offset by a $10.7 million decrease in dial-up and DSL services revenues. The increase in ARPU was due to a higher percentage of mobile broadband subscribers, which have higher ARPUs, as well as an increase in mobile broadband ARPU.

These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in transaction-related costs. Unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit totaled $1.3 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step quantitative impairment test is required or chosen, the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $1.2 million of employee termination

We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. The determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. Based on our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 for our MyPoints reporting unit, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate or a 1,000 basis point increase or decrease in the weighting of the market approach, with a corresponding decrease or increase in the weighting of the income approach, would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessment are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and, if applicable, the impairment amount.\nThe decrease in consolidated technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, a $0.4 million decrease in unallocated corporate technology and development expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Social Media segment. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in technology and development expenses associated with our Communications segment.\n\nOur Communications products revenues are generated from the sale of mobile broadband service devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees, and are recognized upon delivery of such devices as this is considered a separate earnings process from the sale of Communications services.

For purposes of the member redemption liability, \"inactive\" means a lack of all of the following: email response; survey completion; profile update; and any point-earning or point-redeeming transaction. The canceling or disabling of inactive MyPoints accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as we fully consider inactive MyPoints accounts when establishing the member redemption liability, as discussed above.\nMember redemption liability for loyalty marketing service points represents the estimated costs associated with the obligation of MyPoints to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its loyalty marketing service members, less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption. The estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues, except for the portion related to member acquisition activities, internal marketing surveys and other non-revenue generating activities, which are presented in sales and marketing expenses. The member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points, less an allowance for points expected to expire, and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds.\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of acquired pay accounts and free accounts; certain acquired trademarks and trade names; acquired rights, content and intellectual property; and other acquired identifiable intangible assets.\nPay Accounts. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from our pay accounts, which represent one of the most important drivers of our business model. A pay account is defined as a member who has paid for a subscription to a Communications or Social Media service, and whose subscription has not terminated or expired. A subscription provides the member with access to our service for a specific term (for example, a month or a year) and may be renewed upon the expiration of each term. One-time purchases of our services, with the exception of our free and prepaid mobile broadband service, are not considered subscriptions and thus, are not included in the pay accounts metric. A pay account does not equate to a unique subscriber because one subscriber could have several pay accounts. In addition, at any point in time, our pay account base includes customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and have been inactive for 90 days or less, as well as a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool, such as the subscribers receiving our free mobile broadband service, and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect. In general, the key business metrics that affect our revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and the average monthly revenue per pay account. A pay account generally becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by $12.7 million, or 71%. The decrease was primarily driven by:\nThe decrease in Communications sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in mobile broadband marketing costs across Sprint's 3G Network, which expanded the potential subscriber base for mobile broadband services and a $0.5 million decrease in marketing costs associated with our dial-up services due to a decrease in demand for dial-up Internet access.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated corporate general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,425 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>37,764 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(9,339 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (25 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands,\nexcept percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated corporate cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>230 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(153 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (67 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 Year to\nLess than\n3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 Years to\nLess than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Member redemption liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,103 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,215 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,580 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncancelable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>32,036 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,463 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,475 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,273 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,825 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\n\u2022 a $4.7 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to income taxes receivable;

statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and with the instructions for the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters, the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe decrease in unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation, was primarily due to an $8.3 million decrease in transaction-related costs, as well as a $2.3 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives, including lower facilities-related costs in connection with moving our corporate headquarters. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in professional services and consulting fees and a $0.4 million increase in reserves recorded for legal settlements. Unallocated corporate general and administrative\nCommunications restructuring and other exit costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of employee termination costs.\nSocial Media cost of revenues was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,933 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,784 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(2,851 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (22 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of Commerce & Loyalty revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommunications Sales and Marketing\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,388 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>58,508 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(10,120 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (17 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total segment general and administrative expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commerce & Loyalty\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Social Media\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nCommunications services revenues consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for dial-up Internet access, mobile broadband, DSL, email, Internet security, web hosting, voice services, and other services. Social Media services revenues primarily consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for social networking services. Our Communications and Social Media services revenues are primarily dependent on two factors: the average number of pay accounts for a period and ARPU. In general, we charge our pay accounts in advance of providing a service, which results in the deferral of services revenue to the period in which the services are provided. Communications services revenues also include revenues generated from the resale of telecommunications to third parties.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>61,101 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,035 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(934 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues as a percentage of total segment cost of revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commerce & Loyalty\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>38.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Social Media\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022 Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $5.7 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $0.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of property and equipment that was not yet paid for and was included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the range of $4.0 million to $5.0 million, which includes the aforementioned $0.2 million of purchases on account at December 31, 2015. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, which are difficult to predict. Technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nCorporate Revenues\nSocial Media Revenues\n\nMyPoints members may redeem points for third-party gift cards and other rewards. Members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by MyPoints, purchase goods or services from advertisers, engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers, or engage in other specified activities.\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which among other things, addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, we modified how we report segment information to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") as the information regularly reviewed by the CODM had changed. As a result of the changes, we now report three operating segments to the CODM, including the Communications segment, as well as separately reporting the operating results of the Commerce & Loyalty and Social Media segments (which, in prior periods, were reported to the CODM together as the Content & Media segment). This change has been reflected through a retroactive revision of prior-period segment information to conform to the newly-defined segment information.\n\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nCommerce & Loyalty restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of employee termination costs and facility closure and relocation costs. Restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of employee termination costs. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline operations, prioritize resources for growth initiatives and increase profitability.\nCommunications Cost of Revenues\nBased on our current projections, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations, at least for the next 12 months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.7 million, or 196%. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and a $1.1 million decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nThe following table sets forth our key business metrics:\n\u2022 a $1.0 million favorable change in inventories due to a $3.1 million favorable change from our Communications segment as a result of a decrease in mobile broadband device inventory in the year ended December 31, 2014, coupled with an increase in inventory in the year ended December 31, 2013. These favorable changes were significantly offset by a $2.1 million unfavorable change from our Commerce & Loyalty segment due to a slight gift card inventory decrease in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $2.2 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2013;\nMember Redemption Liability\nCash flows from financing activities may also be impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units we grant to employees. In general, we currently do not collect the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes from employees upon vesting of restricted stock units. Instead, we automatically withhold, from the restricted stock units that vest, the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due. We then pay the minimum statutory withholding taxes in cash. The withholding of these shares, although accounted for as a common stock repurchase, does not reduce the amount available under the Program. Similar to repurchases of common stock under the Program, the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities. The amounts remitted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $1.7 million, $2.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for which we withheld 0.1 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the restricted stock units that vested. The amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price and the number of applicable restricted stock units vesting during the period.\nCommunications products revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of mobile broadband devices to our mobile broadband customers and to our retail partners and from the sale of\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $4.2 million, or 30%. The increase was primarily driven by:\nOur summary cash flows for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands):\nIn general, we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers. Users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently. We do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier. As a result, total active accounts may not represent total unique users.\nCommerce & Loyalty Sales and Marketing\nCommerce & Loyalty Technology and Development\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nCommunications cost of revenues includes telecommunications and data center costs; personnel and overhead-related costs associated with operating our networks and data centers; depreciation of network computers and equipment; license fees; costs related to providing customer support; costs related to customer billing and billing support for our pay accounts; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; domain name registration fees; and the costs associated with the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related shipping and handling costs.\nResults of Operations\nCommunications Revenues\n\n\nUnallocated Corporate Results\nService revenues for our Communications services and social networking services are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts and are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer. Our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card, PayPal, automated clearinghouse, or check, and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period. Advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. We offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain Communications pay service plans. These alternative payment methods currently include payment by money order or payment through a local telephone company. In circumstances where payment is not received in advance, revenues are only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured.\nUnallocated corporate cost of revenues consist of indirect cost of revenues associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. Unallocated corporate cost of revenues were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions\nCommerce & Loyalty Revenues\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe increase in consolidated cost of revenues was due to a $7.9 million increase in cost of revenues associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, significantly offset by a $4.7 million decrease in cost of revenues associated with our Communications segment, a $0.8 million decrease in\nSocial Media Cost of Revenues\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collectibility becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nCommunications General and Administrative\n\nCommunications Sales and Marketing\nThe decrease in Communications technology and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs from restructuring initiatives.\n\nConsolidated Results\n\nCommerce & Loyalty Cost of Revenues\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nCommerce & Loyalty Segment Results\nThe decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a $10.7 million decrease in revenues from our Commerce & Loyalty segment and a $3.0 million decrease in revenues from our Social Media segment, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in revenues from our Communications segment.\nThe decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a $12.9 million decrease in revenues from our Communications segment and a $7.4 million decrease in revenues from our Social Media segment, partially offset by a $5.8 million increase in revenues from our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nThe decrease in Social Media sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to reduced spending on customer acquisition. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 8%.\nCommerce & Loyalty Sales and Marketing\n\n\nTechnology and Development\nConsolidated interest income was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nAdjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media general and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 4%.\n\nWe account for identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, shifts in technology, loss of key management or other personnel, significant negative industry or economic trends, changes in our operating model or strategy, and competitive forces. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on either a\nServices Revenues\nCommerce & Loyalty Cost of Revenues\nThe decrease in Communications general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs from restructuring initiatives, a $0.8 million decrease in reserves for a separation settlement with a former executive officer and a $0.3 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGross Merchandise Sales. Gross merchandise sales is the total dollar value of Commerce & Loyalty member purchases during the reporting period, excluding applicable taxes and net of refunds, directly on the MyPoints site, on third-party sites accessed through the MyPoints portal, or on other Commerce & Loyalty properties. We include the purchases and refunds that are reported by our\nSocial Media Sales and Marketing\nSocial Media Cost of Revenues\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nGeneral and Administrative\nCommunications Segment Results\ncommissions and personnel-related expenses. We have expended significant amounts on sales and marketing, including branding and customer acquisition campaigns consisting of television, Internet, public relations, sponsorships, print, and outdoor advertising, and on retail and other performance-based distribution relationships. Marketing and advertising costs to promote our services and products are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses include media, agency and promotion expenses. Media production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is run. Media and agency costs are expensed over the period the advertising runs.\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCost of Revenues\nCommunications Cost of Revenues\nForward-Looking Statements\nConsolidated amortization of intangible assets was essentially flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nGeneral\n\npartners on or before the 15th calendar day following the end of the reporting period, to allow our partners to report purchases completed within the reporting period. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of member engagement with our Commerce & Loyalty properties.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which may result in restructuring. Although restructuring efforts may reduce expenses and generate improved operating efficiencies, there can be no assurances that our restructuring efforts will be successful. In addition, past restructuring activities may not be a good indication of future restructuring opportunities, and any restructuring of our businesses may leave us with reduced financial and marketing resources to develop products and services to compete against our competitors. We recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, which\nThe increase in consolidated other income, net, was primarily due to $0.8 million of transition services income earned in the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in gains related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts.\nThe decrease in Communications cost of revenues was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in costs due to lower DSL and dial-up subscribers, a $1.8 million decrease attributable to lower mobile broadband device costs, a $0.5 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs, a $0.3 million decrease in costs associated with our lower advertising sales and a performance credit from an advertising services provider, and a $0.3 million decrease in costs of add-on services of dial-up and DSL subscribers.\nUnallocated corporate technology and development expenses consist of indirect technology and development associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. The decrease in unallocated corporate technology and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs.\nMyPoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members. This reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point-earning trends, redemption activities and individual member account activity. MyPoints' historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members' accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer, less an estimated reactivation rate, plus an estimate for future cancelations of points that have not yet been outstanding for 180 days. Changes in, among other factors, the net number of points issued, redemption activities and members' activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at December 31, 2015 by approximately $51,000.\nAdvertising revenues from our Communications services and from our social networking services consist primarily of amounts from our Internet search provider that are generated as a result of users utilizing such provider's Internet search services, amounts generated from display advertisements, and amounts generated from referring members to third-party websites or services. We recognize such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a written contract is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a customer-specific agreement. We assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction. The reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of our internally-tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and, when available, to third-party or customer-provided performance data.\n\n\n\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nCommitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were scheduled to expire as follows (in thousands):\nAdvertising and Other Revenues\nThe decrease in consolidated technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Communications segment, a $0.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Social Media segment and a $0.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nTechnology and development expenses include expenses for product development, maintenance of existing software, technology and websites, and development of new or improved software and technology, including personnel-related expenses for our technology group in various locations. Costs incurred by us to manage and monitor our technology and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\ncost of revenues associated with our Social Media segment and a $0.5 million decrease in depreciation expense.\nCommerce & Loyalty General and Administrative\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n\nThe increase in Communications cost of revenues was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in costs associated with our mobile broadband service due to increased mobile broadband subscribers. The increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in costs associated with our DSL service due to a decrease in the number of DSL subscribers, as well as a $0.7 million decrease in telecommunications costs and a $0.6 million decrease in customer support and billing-related costs due to a decrease in the number of dial-up Internet access pay accounts. In addition, costs associated with our email and Internet security services decreased by $0.4 million. Included in the cost associated with our mobile broadband services was a provision for excess inventory and obsolescence, as well as a markdown of mobile broadband service inventory-related balances totaling $1.1 million.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nThe increase in Commerce & Loyalty advertising and other revenues was primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in gift card revenues, including Swappable gift card desktop and mobile app revenues and a $0.2 million increase in display advertising revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in market research revenues.\nThe following tables set forth selected historical consolidated statements of operations and segment information data, which should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, and Other Commitments included in this Item 7, as well as Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty cost of revenues was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in costs related to the sale of gift cards, a $2.4 million decrease in point costs, a $1.1 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives in April 2014, and a $0.5 million decrease in costs associated with the sale of third-party merchandise.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\n\u2022 a $3.2 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to a $2.8 million unfavorable change in income taxes receivable;\nSocial Media Segment Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes totaling $0.8 million on a pre-tax income totaling $4.4 million, compared to a provision for income taxes totaling $46.6 million on a pre-tax loss totaling $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance release recognized against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a valuation allowance reserve recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets, the effect of the goodwill impairment charge and uncertain tax positions recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nstraight-line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations.\nTechnology and Development\nThe decrease in Social Media services revenues was primarily due to a decrease in ARPU due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, as well as a decrease in average pay accounts. The decrease in Social Media advertising revenues was attributable to lower active accounts and a decrease in advertising impressions delivered. Adjusting for the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media revenues decreased by $2.8 million, or 9%. We anticipate revenues and pay accounts will continue to decline year over year in 2016.\nOther Income, Net\nUnallocated Corporate Technology and Development\n\u2022 a $5.6 million favorable change in accounts receivable due to a decline in Communications advertising revenues, as well as a decline in Commerce & Loyalty revenues in 2014 primarily as a result of our restructuring initiatives in the year ended December 31, 2014;\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $1.1 million of employee termination costs in the Communications segment, as well as $0.4 million of employee termination costs in unallocated corporate expenses. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline segment operations and increase profitability. At December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.1 million.\nInflation did not have a material impact on our consolidated revenues and results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nSales and marketing expenses include expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products and with generating advertising revenues. Expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products include advertising and promotion expenses; fees paid to distribution partners, third-party advertising networks and co-registration partners to acquire new pay and free accounts; personnel and overhead-related expenses for marketing, merchandising, customer service, and sales personnel; and telemarketing costs incurred to acquire and retain pay accounts and up-sell pay accounts to additional services. Expenses associated with generating advertising revenues include sales\nUnallocated corporate technology and development expenses consist of indirect technology and development associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. Unallocated corporate technology and development expenses were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCorporate revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were related to transition services provided to FTD in connection with the FTD Spin-Off Transaction.\nSocial Media Technology and Development\nUnallocated corporate restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of employee termination costs.\n\nWe performed the annual quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of our Communications and Social Media reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The fair value of our MyPoints reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill, by approximately 22%. Accordingly, the second step was not required for any of our reporting units.\nCommunications Segment Results\n\u2022 Services revenues. Services revenues in our Communications and Social Media segments are derived from selling subscriptions to consumers, who are typically billed in advance for the entire subscription term.\nGoodwill\nSocial Media general and administrative expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nsegment pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and the end of a period. ARPU may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which promotional, discounted or retention pricing is used to attract new, or retain existing, paying subscribers; changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans; increases or decreases in the price of our services; the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period; and for the Social Media segment, the average foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro.\n\nUnallocated Corporate Cost of Revenues\nUnallocated Corporate Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations decreased by $24.7 million, or 95%. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was due to a $31.0 million decrease in payments of dividends and dividend equivalents on nonvested restricted stock units and a $1.5 million decrease in repurchase of common stock. These decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in proceeds from exercises of stock options, a $1.6 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock purchase plans, and a $1.1 million decrease in excess tax benefits from equity awards.\nSales and Marketing\nThe pay accounts and ARPU metrics for the Social Media segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which discounted pricing is offered in prior and current periods, and the churn rate.\nUnited Online, through its operating subsidiaries, provides consumer services and products over the Internet under a number of brands, including NetZero, Juno, MyPoints, StayFriends, and Trombi.\n\n\u2022 a $1.3 million favorable change in other liabilities primarily due to a decrease, in 2014, in reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nUnallocated Corporate General and Administrative\nRestructuring and other exit costs consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations and other employee termination events. Restructuring and other exit costs include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring and other exit cost liabilities in accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur revenues are comprised of services revenues, which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts; advertising and other revenues; and products revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees; the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees; and from the sale of third-party merchandise.\nInterest Income\nCommunications Technology and Development\nCorporate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were related to transition services provided to FTD in connection with the FTD Spin-Off Transaction.\nLetters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements and contractual obligations. The letters of credit remain in effect at varying levels through the terms of the related agreements.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\nLegal Contingencies\n\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations decreased by $2.3 million, or 30% primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\nThe increase in consolidated other income, net, was primarily due to an increase in realized and unrealized gains related to forward currency exchange contracts, partially offset by a decrease in gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement.\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty technology and development expenses was the result of a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\n\n\u2022 a $2.9 million unfavorable change in inventories due to an increase in gift card inventory held at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, driven by increased gift card sales for our Commerce & Loyalty segment;\nThe decrease in Communications general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs and a $0.1 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, largely offset by a $0.9 million increase in legal amounts recorded attributable to the mutual agreement to terminate the employment of an executive officer.\nSocial Media services revenues decreased due to a decrease in average pay accounts. The decrease in Social Media advertising revenues was attributable to lower active accounts and a decrease in advertising impressions delivered.\nOther Income, Net\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.2 million, or 39%. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in proceeds from sales of investments.\nSocial Media Segment Results\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nconsisted of employee termination costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $1.5 million of restructuring and other exit costs. At December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.1 million, which will be paid within 12 months.\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing expenses was due to a $2.6 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014 and a $0.2 million decrease in online loyalty marketing spend.\nmobile broadband paid service plans are determined by vendor specific objective evidence, which is based upon the monthly stand-alone selling price of each plan. The selling prices of the mobile broadband service devices and free service plans are determined by management's best estimate of selling price, which considers market and economic conditions, internal costs, pricing, and discounting practices. The revenues allocated to the free service plans are recognized ratably over the service period. Activation fees received upfront in excess of the amount allocated to mobile broadband devices are deferred and recognized as services revenues over the estimated service period.\nCorporate Revenues\n\nUnallocated corporate cost of revenues consist of indirect cost of revenues associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. The decrease in unallocated corporate cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs.\n\u2022 an $8.0 million unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to a $6.4 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service accrued in a prior period and paid in 2015; a $1.0 million unfavorable change in personnel-related cost liabilities due to our restructuring initiatives; a $0.9 million separation settlement with a former executive officer accrued in 2014 and paid in 2015; and an unfavorable change in accrued costs related to our Communications services. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes in income taxes payable and accrued legal fees;\nSales and Marketing\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThe pay accounts, churn and ARPU metrics for the Communications segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the number of mobile broadband pay accounts, which have a higher churn rate and ARPU.\nThe member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted-average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future. The weighted-average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed. MyPoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members. The discounts and points needed to redeem awards vary by merchant and award denomination. MyPoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards.\nConsolidated amortization of intangible assets was essentially flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nChurn. To evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base, we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire, which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate. Our average monthly churn rate for a period is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. Our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms, which affects the timing of subscription expirations, and other factors. We make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions. For our Communications segment, our churn calculation does not include accounts canceled during the first 30 days of service other than dial-up accounts that have upgraded from free accounts, but the calculation does include customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and, at any time during the period, reached 90 consecutive days of inactivity. A number of such accounts nevertheless will be included in our pay account totals at any given measurement date. Subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have canceled a pay account depending on the services and, as such, our segment churn rates are not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers canceling any particular service.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes totaling $4.0 million on pre-tax income totaling $8.5 million, compared to a provision for income taxes totaling $0.8 million on pre-tax income totaling $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets and a valuation allowance reserve recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a valuation allowance release recognized against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCommerce & Loyalty Technology and Development\nTechnology and Development\n\nActive Accounts. We monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base. Communications segment active accounts include all Communications segment pay accounts as of the date presented combined with the number of free dial-up Internet access and email accounts that logged on to our services at least once during the preceding 31 days. Social Media segment active accounts are defined as the sum of all pay accounts as of the date presented; and the monthly average for the period of all free accounts who have visited our social networking websites at least once during the period. Segment active accounts for six-month, nine-month and annual periods are calculated as a simple average of the quarterly active accounts for each respective segment.\nCommunications Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGoodwill impairment charges totaling $37.8 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to a material reduction in the fair value of the Social Media reporting unit.\n\n", "item_7_text": "\nGeneral and Administrative\nSales and Marketing\nRevenues\nInterest Income\nKey Business Metrics\nOur Communications services generate advertising revenues from search placements, display advertisements and online market research associated with our Internet access and email services. Advertising revenues also include intercompany commissions from the Commerce & Loyalty segment which are included in reported segment results and are eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe decrease in Social Media cost of revenues was primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in hosting fees, a $0.2 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs and a $0.2 million decrease in bank service charges. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media cost of revenues decreased by $0.4 million, or 14%.\n\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units. The determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally includes a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is typically determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach is weighted at 75%, unless a meaningful base of market data is unavailable, in which case, the market approach is not used.\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty technology and development expenses was the result of a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\nInterest expense was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nInterest Expense\nOther Income, Net\n\u2022 a $3.4 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable primarily due to declines in advertising revenues;\nrevenues was due to a decline in active accounts, partially offset by an increase in advertising revenues due to higher advertising rates.\n\n\u2022 a $1.8 million unfavorable change in other liabilities due to a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions in the year ended December 31, 2014; and\n\nThe decrease in Social Media technology and development expenses was due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs.\nAdvertising and other revenues for our loyalty marketing service consist primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members, when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions. Each of these activities is a discrete, independent activity, which generally is specified in the agreement with each advertising customer. As the earning activities take place, activity measurement data (examples include the number of emails delivered and the number of responses received) is accumulated and the related revenues are recorded. Our loyalty marketing service also generates revenues from the sale of gift cards.\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014, as well as a $0.3 million decrease in bad debt expense.\nThe decrease in Social Media sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $1.8 million in reduced spending on customer acquisition, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in personnel and overhead-related costs.\nSocial Media General and Administrative\n\nIf we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from, among other factors, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as impair our ability to pay future dividends and our ability to service our debt obligations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders could be reduced. Furthermore, such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock. In addition, trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds, at least in the near term.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In accordance with ASC 740, we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of our tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\n\nInterest Expense\nInflation\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nUnallocated Corporate Sales and Marketing\nThe decrease in consolidated cost of revenues was primarily due to a $7.5 million decrease in cost of revenues associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment and a $0.2 million decrease in depreciation expense, significantly offset by a $6.5 million increase in cost of revenues associated with our Communications segment.\nThe decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was due to a $7.9 million decrease in unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses, a $2.7 million decrease in general and administrative expenses associated with our Communications segment, a $0.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses associated with our Social Media segment, and a $0.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in depreciation expense.\n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations. We record liabilities related to pending matters when an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss. As additional information becomes available, we continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters.\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $1.1 million and $0.4 million of employee termination costs and facility closure and relocation costs, respectively, in the Commerce & Loyalty segment, as well as $1.2 million of employee termination costs in unallocated corporate expenses and $0.4 million of employee termination costs in the Communications segment. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline segment operations and increase profitability.\nThe increase in Communications revenues consisted primarily of a $2.7 million increase in products revenues driven by the sale of mobile broadband devices from higher signups and lower discounting on devices. The increase in Communications services revenues was due to an $11.3 million increase in mobile broadband services revenues driven by the increase in the number of mobile broadband subscribers, largely offset by a $10.7 million decrease in dial-up and DSL services revenues. The increase in ARPU was due to a higher percentage of mobile broadband subscribers, which have higher ARPUs, as well as an increase in mobile broadband ARPU. The decrease in advertising\nConsolidated Results\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty advertising and other revenues was primarily due to restructuring initiatives, which resulted in a $4.3 million decrease in display advertising revenues, a $3.4 million decrease in gift card revenues, a $0.9 million decrease in market research revenues, a $0.6 million decrease in games revenues, and a $0.3 million decrease in search revenues. The decrease in Commerce & Loyalty products revenues was due to a decrease in revenues generated from the sale of third-party merchandise.\n\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest incurred related to tax and other regulatory filings.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $4.8 million, of which $1.3 million was included in other liabilities in the contractual obligations table above and, at December 31, 2015, was expected to be due in less than one year. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments for long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will occur.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, which include unallocated corporate expenses, consist of personnel-related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, internal audit, investor relations, internal customer support personnel and personnel associated with operating our corporate network systems. In addition, general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees for legal, accounting and financial services; insurance; occupancy and other overhead-related costs; office relocation costs; non-income taxes; gains and losses on the sale of assets; bad debt expense; and reserves or expenses incurred as a result of settlements, judgments, fines, penalties, assessment, or other resolutions related to litigation, arbitration, investigations, disputes, or similar matters. General and administrative expenses also include expenses resulting from actual or potential transactions such as business combinations, mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, spin offs, financing transactions, and other strategic transactions, including, without limitation, expenses for advisors and representatives such as investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, and accounting firms.\n\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $26.2 million, or 33%, to $104.8 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $78.6 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe decrease in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, a $2.2 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Communications segment and a $1.4 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Social Media segment.\nWe operate three reportable segments, in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and we have identified three reporting units-Communications, MyPoints and Social Media-for purposes of evaluating goodwill. These reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. The goodwill related to our acquired businesses is specific to each reporting unit and the goodwill amounts are assigned as such.\n\n\nInterest Income\n\u2022 a $3.2 million favorable change due to an increase in income from continuing operations, net of non-cash reconciling items;\nUnallocated Corporate Results\nexpenses associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit totaled $2.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, sureties and insurance companies, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. For example, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser of our former Classmates domestic business unit for certain liabilities and have retained responsibility for certain legal proceedings relating to the Classmates domestic business unit. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. We have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities, including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers and employees, and former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies, in certain circumstances.\n\u2022 Advertising and other revenues. Advertising and other revenues are primarily derived from various advertising, marketing and media-related initiatives in all of our segments. Advertising and other revenues in our Commerce & Loyalty segment also include fees generated when members complete online transactions, when emails are transmitted to members and when members respond to emails and revenues from the sale of physical gift cards and electronic gift codes.\nUnallocated Corporate Cost of Revenues\n\n\u2022 a $0.6 million unfavorable change in member redemption liability primarily due to a decline in Commerce & Loyalty revenues in 2014 as a result of restructuring initiatives in the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\n\u2022 a $5.1 million unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to a $6.2 million tax accrual established in 2013 for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, and the timing of payments;\n\u2022 Products revenues. Products revenues in our Communications segment are derived from the sale of mobile broadband devices, as well as the related shipping and handling fees. Products revenues in our Social Media segment are derived from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees.\nIn March 2015, we reached an audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and, in connection with such settlement, we remitted $6.4 million to the Internal Revenue Service in the quarter ended June 30, 2015, for which we had previously established a reserve. Additionally, as discussed in Note 12, \"Contingencies-Legal Matters\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Classmates, Inc. cooperated with a Multistate Work Group of Attorneys General in connection with their investigations of our former post-transaction sales practices and certain other current or former business practices. In May 2015, Classmates, Inc. executed settlement agreements with each member of the Multistate Work Group, and in July 2015, we remitted $8.2 million in connection with the settlements, which was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations. In October 2015, we received insurance proceeds in the amount of $4.2 million related to the Multistate Work Group inquiry and accompanying legal fees. Of this amount, $2.8 million was allocated to United Online, Inc., which was included in cash flows from discontinued operations, and $1.4 million was allocated to FTD, which was remitted to FTD in October 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\n\u2022 an $8.1 million favorable change due to an increase in income from continuing operations, net of non-cash reconciling items;\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our businesses, and to develop forecasts and budgets.

Products revenues from the sale of yearbooks are recognized upon delivery to the customer. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues. Shipping costs are included in cost of revenues.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCommerce & Loyalty General and Administrative\nThe decrease in unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation, was primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives, including lower facilities-related costs in connection with moving our corporate headquarters, a $1.3 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees and a $0.3 million decrease in reserves recorded for legal settlements. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in transaction-related costs. Unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit totaled $1.3 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses will continue to decline year over year in 2016.\nInformation for our three reportable segments, which excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, was as follows (in thousands):\nUnallocated corporate sales and marketing expenses consist of indirect sales and marketing associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. Unallocated corporate sales and marketing expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTesting goodwill for impairment involves a two-step quantitative process. However, prior to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units. If we choose the qualitative option, we are not required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step quantitative impairment test is required or chosen, the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $1.2 million of employee termination costs recorded in our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nProducts Revenues\nWe provide advertising opportunities to marketers with both brand and direct response objectives through a full suite of display, search, email, and text-link opportunities across our various properties. Our social networking services generate advertising revenues primarily from display advertisements on our websites. Advertising inventory on our social networking websites includes text and graphic placements on the user home page, profile page, class list page, and most other pages on our websites. Our loyalty marketing service's advertising and other revenues are derived from advertising fees, consisting primarily of fees based on performance measures, that are generated when emails are transmitted to members, when members respond to emails, when members complete online transactions, and when members engage in a variety of other online activities, including, but not limited to, games, Internet searches and market research surveys. Our loyalty marketing service's advertising and other revenues also include revenues generated from the sale of physical and electronic gift cards.\n\nCommerce & Loyalty cost of revenues includes costs of points earned by members of our loyalty marketing service; costs related to the sale of gift cards; depreciation of network computers and equipment; data center costs; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; costs related to providing customer support; personnel-related costs; and costs related to third-party merchandise.\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605, Revenue Recognition, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). ASC 605 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, no significant Company obligations remain, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues exclude sales taxes collected.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nAdjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media technology and development expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nUnallocated corporate restructuring and other exit costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, consisted of employee termination costs.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, a reconciliation of the changes in the member redemption liability (in thousands):\nmobile phones, as well as the related shipping and handling fees. Social Media products revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees, and from reselling third-party merchandise.\n\n\nRevenues\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProvision for Income Taxes\nUnallocated Corporate General and Administrative\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $1.1 million and $0.4 million of employee termination costs and facility closure and relocation costs, respectively, in the Commerce & Loyalty segment, as well as $1.2 million of employee termination costs in unallocated corporate expenses and $0.4 million of employee termination costs in the Communications segment. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline segment operations and increase profitability. At December 31, 2014, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.2 million.\n\nCommerce & Loyalty Segment Results\nOn August 11, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Classmates, Inc. to Intelius Holdings, Inc. The purchase price received for the Classmates domestic business unit was $30.6 million in cash. The Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale included customary representations, warranties and covenants of each party, some of which survive the closing of the transaction for a period of time. Accordingly, the results of operations, the financial condition and the cash flows of the Classmates domestic business unit have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends.\nUnallocated Corporate Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nSee Note 1, \"Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Accounting Policies, and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nCommunications Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\n\nThe determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. We believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions. The determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables, including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections. Based on our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 for our MyPoints reporting unit, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate or a 1,000 basis point increase or decrease in the weighting of the market approach, with a corresponding decrease or increase in the weighting of the income approach, would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment. We believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment assessment are reasonable, but they are judgmental, and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and, if applicable, the impairment amount.\nThe decrease in consolidated technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, a $0.4 million decrease in unallocated corporate technology and development expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Social Media segment. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in technology and development expenses associated with our Communications segment.\n\nOur Communications products revenues are generated from the sale of mobile broadband service devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees, and are recognized upon delivery of such devices as this is considered a separate earnings process from the sale of Communications services. Sales of mobile broadband service devices bundled with free service plans and paid service plans, and activation fees, are allocated using the relative selling price method in accordance with the multiple-element arrangement provisions of ASC 605. The selling prices of our\nCommunications restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of employee termination costs.\n\nCommerce & Loyalty Revenues\nARPU. We monitor average monthly revenue per pay account (\"ARPU\"), which is calculated by dividing services revenues generated from the pay accounts of our Communications or Social Media segment, as applicable, for a period (after translation into U.S. Dollars) by the average number of\n\nCommunications Revenues\nThe increase in Commerce & Loyalty cost of revenues was due to a $7.7 million increase in costs related to the sale of gift cards and a $1.1 million increase in point costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives in April 2014 and a $0.4 million decrease in hosting and software-related fees.\nThe decrease in consolidated sales and marketing expenses was due to a $2.2 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Communications segment, a $1.8 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Social Media segment and a $0.6 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nSocial Media Sales and Marketing\nUnallocated Corporate Technology and Development\nRestructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of employee termination costs and facility closure and relocation costs. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline operations, prioritize resources for growth initiatives and increase profitability.\nFuture cash flows from financing activities may be affected by our repurchases of shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the \"Program\") that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately-negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors. Our Board of Directors has approved and ratified the Program through December 31, 2015, which date was recently extended by the Board of Directors (in December 2015) to December 31, 2018. There were no repurchases under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013 and, at December 31, 2015, the authorization remaining under the Program was $80.0 million.\n\n\nCommerce & Loyalty Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nCommerce & Loyalty Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\n\nThe decrease in Communications sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in advertising expenses resulting from cost savings initiatives and a $0.8 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs primarily from restructuring initiatives.\nSocial Media General and Administrative\n\n\u2022 a $1.7 million favorable change in member redemption liability primarily due to a decline in online loyalty marketing revenues in 2014 and an increase in such revenues in 2015; and\nWe generate revenues from three primary sources:\nOther income, net, consists of gains and losses on foreign currency exchange rate transactions; realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts; gains or losses related to ineffectiveness of certain derivative instruments; and other non-operating income and expenses.\nThe increase in consolidated interest income was primarily due to higher invested cash balances at our India subsidiary.\nOur three reportable segments consist of the following:\nConsolidated statement of operations information was as follows (in thousands):\nOverview\nSocial Media Technology and Development\nThe decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $9.3 million decrease in unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses, as well as a $0.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nSocial Media cost of revenues includes depreciation of network computers and equipment; data center costs; amortization of content purchases; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; costs related to providing customer support; personnel and overhead-related costs; costs associated with the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling costs; license fees; and domain name registration fees.\nPoints in active MyPoints accounts do not expire; however, unredeemed points expire after 12 consecutive months of inactivity. For purposes of the member redemption liability, \"inactive\" means a lack of all of the following: email response; survey completion; profile update; and any point-earning or point-redeeming transaction. The canceling or disabling of inactive MyPoints accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as we fully consider inactive MyPoints accounts when establishing the member redemption liability, as discussed above.\nMember redemption liability for loyalty marketing service points represents the estimated costs associated with the obligation of MyPoints to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its loyalty marketing service members, less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption. The estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues, except for the portion related to member acquisition activities, internal marketing surveys and other non-revenue generating activities, which are presented in sales and marketing expenses. The member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points, less an allowance for points expected to expire, and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds.\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of acquired pay accounts and free accounts; certain acquired trademarks and trade names; acquired rights, content and intellectual property; and other acquired identifiable intangible assets.\nPay Accounts. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from our pay accounts, which represent one of the most important drivers of our business model. A pay account is defined as a member who has paid for a subscription to a Communications or Social Media service, and whose subscription has not terminated or expired. A subscription provides the member with access to our service for a specific term (for example, a month or a year) and may be renewed upon the expiration of each term. One-time purchases of our services, with the exception of our free and prepaid mobile broadband service, are not considered subscriptions and thus, are not included in the pay accounts metric. A pay account does not equate to a unique subscriber because one subscriber could have several pay accounts. In addition, at any point in time, our pay account base includes customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and have been inactive for 90 days or less, as well as a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool, such as the subscribers receiving our free mobile broadband service, and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect. In general, the key business metrics that affect our revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and the average monthly revenue per pay account. A pay account generally becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by $12.7 million, or 71%. The decrease was primarily driven by:\nThe decrease in Communications sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in mobile broadband marketing costs across Sprint's 3G Network, which expanded the potential subscriber base for mobile broadband services and a $0.5 million decrease in marketing costs associated with our dial-up services due to a decrease in demand for dial-up Internet access.\n\nRevenues\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\n\u2022 a $4.7 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to income taxes receivable; a receivable recorded from a supplier related to our mobile broadband service; a $0.7 million receivable recorded in connection with the sale of our former Classmates domestic business unit; and an unfavorable change in other receivables;\nCommunications General and Administrative\nCost of Revenues\nThe decrease in Communications services revenues was due to a $6.4 million decrease in dial-up and DSL services revenues attributed to lower dial-up and DSL subscribers, partially offset by an increase in ARPU for these services; and a $0.6 million decrease in add-on services, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in mobile broadband services revenues driven by an increase in ARPU. The decrease in Communications advertising revenues was due to decreases in advertising and search impressions from the decline in active accounts. The decrease in Communications products revenues was due to lower mobile broadband sign-ups.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nCommunications Technology and Development\nSocial Media Revenues\nOther Commitments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and with the instructions for the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following accounting policies, estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates and assumptions require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters, the effects of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe decrease in unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation, was primarily due to an $8.3 million decrease in transaction-related costs, as well as a $2.3 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives, including lower facilities-related costs in connection with moving our corporate headquarters. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in professional services and consulting fees and a $0.4 million increase in reserves recorded for legal settlements. Unallocated corporate general and administrative\nCommunications restructuring and other exit costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of employee termination costs.\nSocial Media cost of revenues was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCommunications Sales and Marketing\n\nCommunications services revenues consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for dial-up Internet access, mobile broadband, DSL, email, Internet security, web hosting, voice services, and other services. Social Media services revenues primarily consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for social networking services. Our Communications and Social Media services revenues are primarily dependent on two factors: the average number of pay accounts for a period and ARPU. In general, we charge our pay accounts in advance of providing a service, which results in the deferral of services revenue to the period in which the services are provided. Communications services revenues also include revenues generated from the resale of telecommunications to third parties.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $5.7 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $0.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of property and equipment that was not yet paid for and was included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the range of $4.0 million to $5.0 million, which includes the aforementioned $0.2 million of purchases on account at December 31, 2015. The actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors, which are difficult to predict. Technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment.\nCorporate Revenues\nSocial Media Revenues\n\nMyPoints members may redeem points for third-party gift cards and other rewards. Members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by MyPoints, purchase goods or services from advertisers, engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers, or engage in other specified activities.\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which among other things, addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill. ASC 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, we modified how we report segment information to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") as the information regularly reviewed by the CODM had changed. As a result of the changes, we now report three operating segments to the CODM, including the Communications segment, as well as separately reporting the operating results of the Commerce & Loyalty and Social Media segments (which, in prior periods, were reported to the CODM together as the Content & Media segment). This change has been reflected through a retroactive revision of prior-period segment information to conform to the newly-defined segment information.\n\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nCommerce & Loyalty restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of employee termination costs and facility closure and relocation costs. Restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of employee termination costs. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline operations, prioritize resources for growth initiatives and increase profitability.\nCommunications Cost of Revenues\nBased on our current projections, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations, at least for the next 12 months. We may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund, among other things, long-term growth initiatives, which may include optimizing our current product offerings to enhance our consumer value proposition, expanding new product development efforts to drive new revenue growth, and pursuing acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and other opportunities to expand our scope and reach; the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units to pay the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units; the repurchase of our common stock under the Program; future capital expenditures; and future acquisitions of intangible assets, including rights, content and intellectual property.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.7 million, or 196%. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and a $1.1 million decrease in repurchases of common stock.\nThe following table sets forth our key business metrics:\n\u2022 a $1.0 million favorable change in inventories due to a $3.1 million favorable change from our Communications segment as a result of a decrease in mobile broadband device inventory in the year ended December 31, 2014, coupled with an increase in inventory in the year ended December 31, 2013. These favorable changes were significantly offset by a $2.1 million unfavorable change from our Commerce & Loyalty segment due to a slight gift card inventory decrease in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $2.2 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2013;\nMember Redemption Liability\nCash flows from financing activities may also be impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units we grant to employees. In general, we currently do not collect the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes from employees upon vesting of restricted stock units. Instead, we automatically withhold, from the restricted stock units that vest, the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the minimum statutory employee withholding taxes due. We then pay the minimum statutory withholding taxes in cash. The withholding of these shares, although accounted for as a common stock repurchase, does not reduce the amount available under the Program. Similar to repurchases of common stock under the Program, the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities. The amounts remitted in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $1.7 million, $2.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for which we withheld 0.1 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the restricted stock units that vested. The amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price and the number of applicable restricted stock units vesting during the period.\nCommunications products revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of mobile broadband devices to our mobile broadband customers and to our retail partners and from the sale of\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $4.2 million, or 30%. The increase was primarily driven by:\nOur summary cash flows for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands):\nIn general, we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers. Users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently. We do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier. As a result, total active accounts may not represent total unique users.\nCommerce & Loyalty Sales and Marketing\nCommerce & Loyalty Technology and Development\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nCommunications cost of revenues includes telecommunications and data center costs; personnel and overhead-related costs associated with operating our networks and data centers; depreciation of network computers and equipment; license fees; costs related to providing customer support; costs related to customer billing and billing support for our pay accounts; fees associated with the storage and processing of customer credit cards and associated bank fees; domain name registration fees; and the costs associated with the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related shipping and handling costs.\nResults of Operations\nCommunications Revenues\n\n\nUnallocated Corporate Results\nService revenues for our Communications services and social networking services are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts and are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer. Our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card, PayPal, automated clearinghouse, or check, and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period. Advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. We offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain Communications pay service plans. These alternative payment methods currently include payment by money order or payment through a local telephone company. In circumstances where payment is not received in advance, revenues are only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured.\nUnallocated corporate cost of revenues consist of indirect cost of revenues associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. Unallocated corporate cost of revenues were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions\nCommerce & Loyalty Revenues\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe increase in consolidated cost of revenues was due to a $7.9 million increase in cost of revenues associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment, significantly offset by a $4.7 million decrease in cost of revenues associated with our Communications segment, a $0.8 million decrease in\nSocial Media Cost of Revenues\nProbability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If it is determined that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collectibility becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.\nCommunications General and Administrative\n\nCommunications Sales and Marketing\nThe decrease in Communications technology and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs from restructuring initiatives.\n\nConsolidated Results\n\nCommerce & Loyalty Cost of Revenues\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the asset group to be tested for recoverability. We are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, and remaining economic lives of assets.\nCommerce & Loyalty Segment Results\nThe decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a $10.7 million decrease in revenues from our Commerce & Loyalty segment and a $3.0 million decrease in revenues from our Social Media segment, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in revenues from our Communications segment.\nThe decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily due to a $12.9 million decrease in revenues from our Communications segment and a $7.4 million decrease in revenues from our Social Media segment, partially offset by a $5.8 million increase in revenues from our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nThe decrease in Social Media sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to reduced spending on customer acquisition. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 8%.\nCommerce & Loyalty Sales and Marketing\n\n\nTechnology and Development\nConsolidated interest income was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nAdjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media general and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 4%.\n\nWe account for identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management's estimate of their fair values. We evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, shifts in technology, loss of key management or other personnel, significant negative industry or economic trends, changes in our operating model or strategy, and competitive forces. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on either a\nServices Revenues\nCommerce & Loyalty Cost of Revenues\nThe decrease in Communications general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs from restructuring initiatives, a $0.8 million decrease in reserves for a separation settlement with a former executive officer and a $0.3 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGross Merchandise Sales. Gross merchandise sales is the total dollar value of Commerce & Loyalty member purchases during the reporting period, excluding applicable taxes and net of refunds, directly on the MyPoints site, on third-party sites accessed through the MyPoints portal, or on other Commerce & Loyalty properties. We include the purchases and refunds that are reported by our\nSocial Media Sales and Marketing\nSocial Media Cost of Revenues\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nGeneral and Administrative\nCommunications Segment Results\ncommissions and personnel-related expenses. We have expended significant amounts on sales and marketing, including branding and customer acquisition campaigns consisting of television, Internet, public relations, sponsorships, print, and outdoor advertising, and on retail and other performance-based distribution relationships. Marketing and advertising costs to promote our services and products are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses include media, agency and promotion expenses. Media production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is run. Media and agency costs are expensed over the period the advertising runs.\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCost of Revenues\nCommunications Cost of Revenues\nForward-Looking Statements\nConsolidated amortization of intangible assets was essentially flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nGeneral\n\npartners on or before the 15th calendar day following the end of the reporting period, to allow our partners to report purchases completed within the reporting period. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of member engagement with our Commerce & Loyalty properties.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which may result in restructuring. Although restructuring efforts may reduce expenses and generate improved operating efficiencies, there can be no assurances that our restructuring efforts will be successful. In addition, past restructuring activities may not be a good indication of future restructuring opportunities, and any restructuring of our businesses may leave us with reduced financial and marketing resources to develop products and services to compete against our competitors. We recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, which\nThe increase in consolidated other income, net, was primarily due to $0.8 million of transition services income earned in the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in gains related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts.\nThe decrease in Communications cost of revenues was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in costs due to lower DSL and dial-up subscribers, a $1.8 million decrease attributable to lower mobile broadband device costs, a $0.5 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs, a $0.3 million decrease in costs associated with our lower advertising sales and a performance credit from an advertising services provider, and a $0.3 million decrease in costs of add-on services of dial-up and DSL subscribers.\nUnallocated corporate technology and development expenses consist of indirect technology and development associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. The decrease in unallocated corporate technology and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs.\nMyPoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members. This reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point-earning trends, redemption activities and individual member account activity. MyPoints' historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members' accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer, less an estimated reactivation rate, plus an estimate for future cancelations of points that have not yet been outstanding for 180 days. Changes in, among other factors, the net number of points issued, redemption activities and members' activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at December 31, 2015 by approximately $51,000.\nAdvertising revenues from our Communications services and from our social networking services consist primarily of amounts from our Internet search provider that are generated as a result of users utilizing such provider's Internet search services, amounts generated from display advertisements, and amounts generated from referring members to third-party websites or services. We recognize such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a written contract is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a customer-specific agreement. We assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction. The reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of our internally-tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and, when available, to third-party or customer-provided performance data.\n\n\n\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nCommitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were scheduled to expire as follows (in thousands):\nAdvertising and Other Revenues\nThe decrease in consolidated technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Communications segment, a $0.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Social Media segment and a $0.5 million decrease in technology and development expenses associated with our Commerce & Loyalty segment.\nTechnology and development expenses include expenses for product development, maintenance of existing software, technology and websites, and development of new or improved software and technology, including personnel-related expenses for our technology group in various locations. Costs incurred by us to manage and monitor our technology and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\ncost of revenues associated with our Social Media segment and a $0.5 million decrease in depreciation expense.\nCommerce & Loyalty General and Administrative\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\n\nThe increase in Communications cost of revenues was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in costs associated with our mobile broadband service due to increased mobile broadband subscribers. The increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in costs associated with our DSL service due to a decrease in the number of DSL subscribers, as well as a $0.7 million decrease in telecommunications costs and a $0.6 million decrease in customer support and billing-related costs due to a decrease in the number of dial-up Internet access pay accounts. In addition, costs associated with our email and Internet security services decreased by $0.4 million. Included in the cost associated with our mobile broadband services was a provision for excess inventory and obsolescence, as well as a markdown of mobile broadband service inventory-related balances totaling $1.1 million.\nWe test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key management or other personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business, significant and sustained decline in market capitalization, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nThe increase in Commerce & Loyalty advertising and other revenues was primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in gift card revenues, including Swappable gift card desktop and mobile app revenues and a $0.2 million increase in display advertising revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in market research revenues.\nThe following tables set forth selected historical consolidated statements of operations and segment information data, which should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, and Other Commitments included in this Item 7, as well as Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty cost of revenues was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in costs related to the sale of gift cards, a $2.4 million decrease in point costs, a $1.1 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives in April 2014, and a $0.5 million decrease in costs associated with the sale of third-party merchandise.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\n\u2022 a $3.2 million unfavorable change in other assets primarily due to a $2.8 million unfavorable change in income taxes receivable;\nSocial Media Segment Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes totaling $0.8 million on a pre-tax income totaling $4.4 million, compared to a provision for income taxes totaling $46.6 million on a pre-tax loss totaling $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance release recognized against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a valuation allowance reserve recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets, the effect of the goodwill impairment charge and uncertain tax positions recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013.\n\nstraight-line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. Our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations.\nTechnology and Development\nThe decrease in Social Media services revenues was primarily due to a decrease in ARPU due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, as well as a decrease in average pay accounts. The decrease in Social Media advertising revenues was attributable to lower active accounts and a decrease in advertising impressions delivered. Adjusting for the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to a weaker Euro versus the U.S. Dollar, Social Media revenues decreased by $2.8 million, or 9%. We anticipate revenues and pay accounts will continue to decline year over year in 2016.\nOther Income, Net\nUnallocated Corporate Technology and Development\n\u2022 a $5.6 million favorable change in accounts receivable due to a decline in Communications advertising revenues, as well as a decline in Commerce & Loyalty revenues in 2014 primarily as a result of our restructuring initiatives in the year ended December 31, 2014;\nConsolidated restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $1.1 million of employee termination costs in the Communications segment, as well as $0.4 million of employee termination costs in unallocated corporate expenses. These restructuring charges were a result of management's decision to streamline segment operations and increase profitability. At December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.1 million.\nInflation did not have a material impact on our consolidated revenues and results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nSales and marketing expenses include expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products and with generating advertising revenues. Expenses associated with promoting our brands, services and products include advertising and promotion expenses; fees paid to distribution partners, third-party advertising networks and co-registration partners to acquire new pay and free accounts; personnel and overhead-related expenses for marketing, merchandising, customer service, and sales personnel; and telemarketing costs incurred to acquire and retain pay accounts and up-sell pay accounts to additional services. Expenses associated with generating advertising revenues include sales\nUnallocated corporate technology and development expenses consist of indirect technology and development associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. Unallocated corporate technology and development expenses were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCorporate revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were related to transition services provided to FTD in connection with the FTD Spin-Off Transaction.\nSocial Media Technology and Development\nUnallocated corporate restructuring and other exit costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of employee termination costs.\n\nWe performed the annual quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of our Communications and Social Media reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The fair value of our MyPoints reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill, by approximately 22%. Accordingly, the second step was not required for any of our reporting units.\nCommunications Segment Results\n\u2022 Services revenues. Services revenues in our Communications and Social Media segments are derived from selling subscriptions to consumers, who are typically billed in advance for the entire subscription term.\nGoodwill\nSocial Media general and administrative expenses were relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nsegment pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and the end of a period. ARPU may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which promotional, discounted or retention pricing is used to attract new, or retain existing, paying subscribers; changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans; increases or decreases in the price of our services; the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period; and for the Social Media segment, the average foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro.\n\nUnallocated Corporate Cost of Revenues\nUnallocated Corporate Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations decreased by $24.7 million, or 95%. The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was due to a $31.0 million decrease in payments of dividends and dividend equivalents on nonvested restricted stock units and a $1.5 million decrease in repurchase of common stock. These decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in proceeds from exercises of stock options, a $1.6 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock purchase plans, and a $1.1 million decrease in excess tax benefits from equity awards.\nSales and Marketing\nThe pay accounts and ARPU metrics for the Social Media segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which discounted pricing is offered in prior and current periods, and the churn rate.\nUnited Online, through its operating subsidiaries, provides consumer services and products over the Internet under a number of brands, including NetZero, Juno, MyPoints, StayFriends, and Trombi.\n\n\u2022 a $1.3 million favorable change in other liabilities primarily due to a decrease, in 2014, in reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nUnallocated Corporate General and Administrative\nRestructuring and other exit costs consist of costs associated with the realignment and reorganization of our operations and other employee termination events. Restructuring and other exit costs include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. The timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and can extend over a 12-month period. We record restructuring and other exit cost liabilities in accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur revenues are comprised of services revenues, which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts; advertising and other revenues; and products revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale of yearbooks, including the related shipping and handling fees; the sale of mobile broadband devices and mobile phones, including the related activation fees and shipping and handling fees; and from the sale of third-party merchandise.\nInterest Income\nCommunications Technology and Development\nCorporate revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were related to transition services provided to FTD in connection with the FTD Spin-Off Transaction.\nLetters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements and contractual obligations. The letters of credit remain in effect at varying levels through the terms of the related agreements.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\nLegal Contingencies\n\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations decreased by $2.3 million, or 30% primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\nThe increase in consolidated other income, net, was primarily due to an increase in realized and unrealized gains related to forward currency exchange contracts, partially offset by a decrease in gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement.\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty technology and development expenses was the result of a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs due to our restructuring initiatives in April 2014.\n\n\u2022 a $2.9 million unfavorable change in inventories due to an increase in gift card inventory held at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, driven by increased gift card sales for our Commerce & Loyalty segment;\nThe decrease in Communications general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs and a $0.1 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, largely offset by a $0.9 million increase in legal amounts recorded attributable to the mutual agreement to terminate the employment of an executive officer.\nSocial Media services revenues decreased due to a decrease in average pay accounts. The decrease in Social Media advertising revenues was attributable to lower active accounts and a decrease in advertising impressions delivered.\nOther Income, Net\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations increased by $2.2 million, or 39%. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in proceeds from sales of investments.\nSocial Media Segment Results\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nconsisted of employee termination costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $1.5 million of restructuring and other exit costs. At December 31, 2015, accrued restructuring and other exit costs totaled $0.1 million, which will be paid within 12 months.\n\nThe decrease in Commerce & Loyalty sales and marketing expenses was due to a $2.6 million decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives in April 2014 and a $0.2 million decrease in online loyalty marketing spend.\nmobile broadband paid service plans are determined by vendor specific objective evidence, which is based upon the monthly stand-alone selling price of each plan. The selling prices of the mobile broadband service devices and free service plans are determined by management's best estimate of selling price, which considers market and economic conditions, internal costs, pricing, and discounting practices. The revenues allocated to the free service plans are recognized ratably over the service period. Activation fees received upfront in excess of the amount allocated to mobile broadband devices are deferred and recognized as services revenues over the estimated service period.\nCorporate Revenues\n\nUnallocated corporate cost of revenues consist of indirect cost of revenues associated with our former Classmates domestic business unit, which were not included in the results of discontinued operations. The decrease in unallocated corporate cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in personnel and overhead-related costs.\n\u2022 an $8.0 million unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to a $6.4 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service accrued in a prior period and paid in 2015; a $1.0 million unfavorable change in personnel-related cost liabilities due to our restructuring initiatives; a $0.9 million separation settlement with a former executive officer accrued in 2014 and paid in 2015; and an unfavorable change in accrued costs related to our Communications services. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes in income taxes payable and accrued legal fees;\nSales and Marketing\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThe pay accounts, churn and ARPU metrics for the Communications segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the number of mobile broadband pay accounts, which have a higher churn rate and ARPU.\nThe member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted-average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future. The weighted-average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed. MyPoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members. The discounts and points needed to redeem awards vary by merchant and award denomination. MyPoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards.\nConsolidated amortization of intangible assets was essentially flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nChurn. To evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base, we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire, which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate. Our average monthly churn rate for a period is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for that period, divided by the number of months in that period. Our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms, which affects the timing of subscription expirations, and other factors. We make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions. For our Communications segment, our churn calculation does not include accounts canceled during the first 30 days of service other than dial-up accounts that have upgraded from free accounts, but the calculation does include customers who previously purchased prepaid mobile broadband service and, at any time during the period, reached 90 consecutive days of inactivity. A number of such accounts nevertheless will be included in our pay account totals at any given measurement date. Subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have canceled a pay account depending on the services and, as such, our segment churn rates are not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers canceling any particular service.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes totaling $4.0 million on pre-tax income totaling $8.5 million, compared to a provision for income taxes totaling $0.8 million on pre-tax income totaling $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets and a valuation allowance reserve recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a valuation allowance release recognized against our domestic deferred tax assets in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCommerce & Loyalty Technology and Development\nTechnology and Development\n\nActive Accounts. We monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base. Communications segment active accounts include all Communications segment pay accounts as of the date presented combined with the number of free dial-up Internet access and email accounts that logged on to our services at least once during the preceding 31 days. Social Media segment active accounts are defined as the sum of all pay accounts as of the date presented; and the monthly average for the period of all free accounts who have visited our social networking websites at least once during the period. Segment active accounts for six-month, nine-month and annual periods are calculated as a simple average of the quarterly active accounts for each respective segment.\nCommunications Restructuring and Other Exit Costs\nGoodwill impairment charges totaling $37.8 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 due to a material reduction in the fair value of the Social Media reporting

MyPoints, StayFriends, and Trombi. \n- It has three reportable business segments: Communications, Commerce & Loyalty, and Social Media.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n- Consolidated revenues decreased 9% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to declines in Commerce & Loyalty and Social Media revenues.\n- Net income was $30 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $5 million in 2014, mainly due to a $25 million gain from the sale of the Classmates business unit. \n- Cash flows from operations decreased 71% in 2015 compared to 2014.\n\nSegment Performance\n- Communications revenues decreased 13% due to fewer dial-up and DSL subscribers, partially offset by higher mobile broadband revenues.\n- Commerce & Loyalty revenues increased 18% primarily from gift card sales growth.  \n- Social Media revenues decreased 24% mainly due to lower services revenues and advertising revenues.\n\nKey Developments\n- Sold the Classmates business unit in August 2015 for $30.6 million. \n- Restructuring activities continued in 2015 to streamline operations and improve profitability.\n- Impairment tests in 2015 resulted in no goodwill impairment charges.\n\nThe report provides an overview of United Online's business, recent financial performance, and key business developments in 2015 across its main operating segments. Performance varied by segment, with growth in Commerce & Loyalty offset by revenue declines in Communications and Social Media. The sale of Classmates significantly improved overall profitability for the year."}
