Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a software development company that provides software as a service solutions that are intended to help organizations and their customers build better experiences. Our customer experience solutions are built upon a modern architecture that enables us and our customers to rapidly innovate, adapt our technology in novel ways, and easily integrate with other products and applications. With our origins in customer service, we have evolved our offerings over time to product and platform solutions that work together to help organizations understand the broader customer journey, improve communications across all channels, and engage where and when it's needed most.\nWe believe in developing solutions that serve organizations of all sizes and across all industries. Our flagship product solution, Zendesk Support, provides organizations with the ability to track, prioritize, and solve customer support tickets across multiple channels, bringing customer information and interactions into one place. Our other widely available product solutions integrate with Support and include Zendesk Chat, Zendesk Talk, and Zendesk Guide. Chat is live chat software that provides a fast and responsive way for organizations to connect with their customers. Talk is cloud-based call center software that facilitates personal and productive phone support conversations between organizations and their customers. Guide is a self-service destination that organizations can use to provide articles, interactive forums, and a community that help an organization's customers help themselves. Additionally, we offer Zendesk Suite, an omnichannel offering which provides Support, Chat, Talk, and Guide together for a single price, Zendesk Sell, sales customer relationship management software that complements our mission in delivering solutions that provide a better customer experience, Zendesk Duet, an offering which provides Support and Sell together for a single price, Zendesk Sunshine, a customer relationship management platform which enables organizations to connect and integrate customer data generated through our product solutions, Zendesk Sunshine Conversations, a messaging platform solution that allows businesses to integrate messaging through social channels and directly interact and transact with customers, and Zendesk Gather, a product solution that enables companies to provide trusted and transparent support to customers through online community forums.\nWe offer a range of subscription account plans for our solutions that vary in price based on functionality, type, and the amount of product support we offer. We also offer a range of additional features that customers can purchase and add to their subscriptions.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our revenue was $816 million, $599 million, and $430 million, respectively, representing a 36% growth rate from 2018 to 2019 and a 39% growth rate from 2017 to 2018. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 we derived $389 million, or 48%, $289 million, or 48%, and $200 million, or 47%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we generated net losses of $170 million, $131 million, and $102 million, respectively.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, further develop our product and platform solutions geared towards the entire customer experience, build brand recognition and scalable solutions for larger organizations, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business market, add new customers, generate additional revenue from our existing customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected expenditures that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including personnel costs, expenditures relating to hosting capabilities, leasehold improvements, and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of us experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to develop our hosting capabilities primarily through expenditures for third-party managed hosting services. The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary based on our estimates of projected growth and planned use of hosting resources. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by efficiently utilizing our hosting and personnel resources to support the growth in our number of customers. In addition, we expect to incur amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the long-term, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of such costs.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to broaden the functionality of our existing solutions, to further integrate these solutions and services, and to introduce new solutions. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our customer base. We also expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts using our solutions is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on Zendesk Support, exclusive of our legacy Starter plan, free trials, or other free services, the number of accounts on Chat, exclusive of free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts on all of our other products, exclusive of free trials and other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier.\nIn the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we began to offer an omnichannel subscription, which provides access to multiple solutions through a single paid customer account, Zendesk Suite, and in the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we began to offer a subscription which provides access to Sell and Support through a single paid customer account, Zendesk Duet. The number of Suite paid customer accounts are included in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat, and are not included in the number of paid customer accounts on Support or Chat.\nFor the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, each Duet paid customer account was included in the number of paid customer accounts on Support, but not included in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, each Duet paid customer account is included once in the number of paid customer accounts on Support and once in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat in order to more accurately reflect how Zendesk's management views such metric. The effect of this change in methodology did not have a material impact on either the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat or the total number of paid customer accounts for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nExisting customers may also expand their utilization of our products by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our products to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Other than usage of our products through our omnichannel subscription offering, each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. Other than paid accounts for Zendesk Connect, our marketing automation offering, an increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities.\nWe had approximately 157,000 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019, including approximately 81,200 paid customer accounts on Support, approximately 42,600 paid customer accounts on Chat, and approximately 33,200 paid customer accounts on our other products. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline. We do not currently include in our number of paid accounts the number of accounts on Sunshine Conversations, our Sunshine platform messaging product, Zendesk Gather, our community forum software, or our legacy Smooch product.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our solutions. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans and the purchase of additional products. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, upgrades in subscription plans, and the purchase of additional products as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our legacy analytics product, our legacy Outbound product, our Sell product, our legacy Starter plan, Sunshine Conversations, Gather, our legacy Smooch product, free trials, or other free services into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our annual recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our products. Annual recurring revenue is determined by multiplying monthly recurring revenue by 12. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we excluded the impact of revenue that we expect to generate from fixed-term contracts that are each associated with an existing account, are solely for additional temporary agents, and are not contemplated to last for the duration of the primary contract for the existing account from our determination of monthly recurring revenue. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from paid customer accounts as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation would result in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 106,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 157,000 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts across their products, and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 116% as of December 31, 2019. We expect that, among other factors, our continued focus on adding larger paid customer accounts at the time of addition and the growth in our revenue will result in an overall decline in our dollar-based net expansion rate over time as our aggregate annual recurring revenue grows.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans for our solutions that vary in price based on functionality, type, and the amount of solution support we offer. We also offer a range of additional features that customers can purchase and add to their subscriptions. Certain arrangements provide for incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period provides sufficient context to accurately predict our future revenue for a given period of time.\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, and expenses for hosting capabilities, primarily for third-party managed hosting services and costs associated with our self-managed colocation data centers. Cost of revenue also includes third-party license fees, payment processing fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, information technology, and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nWe utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia to host our services, support our infrastructure, and support certain research and development functions. In the first quarter of 2019, we completed the transition of our customers from self-managed colocation data centers to third-party managed hosting services.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our infrastructure, professional service organizations, and product support organically and through acquisitions. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to continue to incur capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capabilities of our solutions but also to increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of these investments. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our solutions or for certain subscription plans or integrations, we expect third-party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such solutions and subscription plans to remain significant over time.\nGross Margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of usage of third-party managed hosting resources, investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, increased share-based compensation expense, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, costs associated with capitalized internal-use software, and third-party license fees.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our solutions, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our solutions. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and the extent of our research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, sales commissions, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include both online, and offline marketing initiatives, including digital advertising, such as search engine, paid social, e-mail and product marketing, content marketing, user events, conferences, corporate communications, web marketing and optimization, and outbound list and contact generation. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit, which we have determined to be three years.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our solutions, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales employees, developing our marketing teams, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, accounting, and tax related services, other corporate expenses, and allocated shared costs.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, accounting, tax, and compliance-related services fees, insurance costs, and costs of executing significant transactions, including business acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from marketable securities, foreign currency gains and losses, and interest expense from our convertible senior notes. Interest expense includes amortization of the debt discount, amortization of issuance costs, and contractual interest expense.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States, income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and a non-cash benefit in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019, 2018, and 2017\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our

Revenue\nOur quarterly revenue increased sequentially for each period presented, primarily due to the addition of new customer accounts and the continued expansion of existing customer accounts. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential growth in revenue will continue.\nOur revenue in the first quarter of any fiscal year is negatively impacted relative to the preceding fourth quarter due to the fewer number of days in the first quarter over which we record subscription revenue as compared to the preceding fourth quarter.\nQuarterly Trends in Expenses\nOur quarterly expenses increased sequentially for all but one period presented, primarily due to increased compensation-related costs related to an increase in headcount in connection with the expansion of our business. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2019 included certain one-time general and administrative costs. Refer to Results of Operations above for further discussion.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our solutions and services, and believe that our quarterly sales are affected by industry buying patterns. For example, we typically have customers who add flexible agents when they need more capacity during busy periods, especially in the fourth quarter, and then subsequently scale back in the first quarter of the following year. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may continue for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $845 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and agency securities.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(66,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(589,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>48,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn March 2018, we issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due March 15, 2023 (refer to Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information). The impact of the convertible senior notes on our liquidity will depend on whether we elect to settle any conversions in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted convertible senior notes in cash. As of the date of this filing, we have received one request for conversion for an immaterial amount.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through customer payments for subscription services, the issuance of our convertible senior notes, and public and private equity financings. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including employee-related expenditures from expansion of our headcount, hosting costs to support the growth in our customer accounts and continued customer expansion, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, features, and functionality, and costs related to building out our leased office facilities. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, hosting costs, office facilities, and marketing programs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $89 million, reflecting our net loss of $170 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $157 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $39\nmillion, amortization of deferred costs of $32 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $25 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $78 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation of $33 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $50 million, primarily related to sales commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $50 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $79 million, reflecting our net loss of $131 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $119 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $37 million, amortization of deferred costs of $21 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $19 million, partially offset by income tax benefit related to convertible senior notes of $14 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $25 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $73 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accrued compensation of $15 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $41 million, primarily related to sales commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $30 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $11 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $42 million, reflecting our net loss of $102 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $85 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $32 million, amortization of deferred costs of $14 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $13 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $52 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accrued liabilities, including accrued compensation, of $14 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $23 million, primarily related to sales commissions, and an increase accounts receivable of $21 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2019 of $67 million was primarily attributable to cash paid for the acquisition of Smooch, net of cash acquired, of $71 million, purchases of property and equipment of $39 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $52 million, net purchases.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 of $590 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $458 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of FutureSimple, net of cash acquired, of $79 million, purchases of property and equipment of $35 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $7 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2017 of $70 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $29 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of Outbound Solutions, Inc., net of cash acquired, of $16 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities and hosting equipment to maintain our self-managed colocation data centers, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2019 of $48 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $31 million and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $26 million, partially offset by payments for withholding taxes related to net share settlement of RSUs of $10 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2018 of $529 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $561 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $21 million, and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $16 million, partially offset by the purchase of the capped call in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $64 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $43 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $32 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $14 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of our convertible senior notes, obligations under our operating leases for office space, and contractual commitments for third-party managed hosting and other support services.

The $575 million in principal is due March 2023. For more information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2) Primarily relates to third-party managed hosting services.\n(3) Represents obligations to make payments under non-cancellable lease agreements for our corporate headquarters and worldwide offices.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Zendesk Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. In addition, we generate revenue by providing additional features to certain of our subscription plans for a fee that is incremental to the base subscription rate for such plans. Subscription service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations or any other right of return. We record revenue net of sales or excise taxes.\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\nSubscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue.\nIn limited circumstances, certain customers have arrangements that provide for a maximum number of users over the subscription term, with usage measured monthly. Incremental fees are incurred when the maximum number of users is exceeded. In determining the transaction price for these arrangements, we evaluate the expected usage and estimate any incremental fees that we are entitled to throughout the subscription term and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. In making these assessments, we constrain our estimates based on factors that could lead to a probable significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. Additionally, certain customers have arrangements that provide for unlimited users during the subscription term for a fixed fee. We recognize revenue from these arrangements on a ratable basis over the subscription term.\nCertain of our product solutions include service-level agreements warranting defined levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits for future services in the event that we fail to meet those levels. To date, we have not accrued for any material liabilities in our consolidated financial statements as a result of these service-level agreements.\nCosts to Obtain Customer Contracts\nSales commissions are paid for initial contracts and expansions of existing customer contracts. Sales commissions and related expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. These costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of our customer contracts, our technology lifecycle, and other factors. Amortization expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense within our consolidated statement of operations. Sales commissions paid for contract renewals are not material.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with software development for our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairments to internal-use software during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to\nintangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the consolidated level, as we operate as a single reporting unit.\nAcquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying amounts of our acquired intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, accounting, and tax related services, other corporate expenses, and allocated shared costs.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>579,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments(2)\n</td> <td>253,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>129,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>962,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExisting customers may also expand their utilization of our products by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our products to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Other than usage of our products through our omnichannel subscription offering, each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. Other than paid accounts for Zendesk Connect, our marketing automation offering, an increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2019\n% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2018\n% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and Marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $53 million, or 29%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $23 million, driven by headcount growth, increased hosting costs of $9 million, and increased third-party license fees of $6 million. The increase in hosting costs was driven by an increase in expenditures for third-party managed hosting services, partially offset by lower depreciation from our self-managed colocation data centers in connection with our transition to third-party managed hosting services. The increase in third-party license fees was driven by increased customer usage of certain product features. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $4 million, primarily related to facilities and information technology.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(As a percentage of revenue)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) Represents obligations to make payments under non-cancellable lease agreements for our corporate headquarters and worldwide offices.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, accounting, tax, and compliance-related services fees, insurance costs, and costs of executing significant transactions, including business acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nThe following unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements and include, in management's opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations data for these periods, in accordance with GAAP. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of usage of third-party managed hosting resources, investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, increased share-based compensation expense, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, costs associated with capitalized internal-use software, and third-party license fees.\nRevenue increased $169 million, or 39%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of paid customer accounts, which grew from approximately 118,900 as of December 31, 2017 to approximately 136,600 as of December 31, 2018 and expansions from existing customers, as reflected in our dollar-based net expansion rate of 119% as of December 31, 2018.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of paid customer accounts, which grew from approximately 136,600 as of December 31, 2018 to approximately 157,000 as of December 31, 2019 and expansions from existing customers, as reflected in our dollar-based net expansion rate of 116% as of December 31, 2019. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes revenue from Smooch Technologies Holdings ULC, or Smooch.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2017 of $70 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $29 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of Outbound Solutions, Inc., net of cash acquired, of $16 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities and hosting equipment to maintain our self-managed colocation data centers, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2019 of $67 million was primarily attributable to cash paid for the acquisition of Smooch, net of cash acquired, of $71 million, purchases of property and equipment of $39 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $52 million, net purchases.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Zendesk Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. In addition, we generate revenue by providing additional features to certain of our subscription plans for a fee that is incremental to the base subscription rate for such plans. Subscription service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations or any other right of return. We record revenue net of sales or excise taxes.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our solutions. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans and the purchase of additional products. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, upgrades in subscription plans, and the purchase of additional products as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our legacy analytics product, our legacy Outbound product, our Sell product, our legacy Starter plan, Sunshine Conversations, Gather, our legacy Smooch product, free trials, or other free services into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our annual recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our products. Annual recurring revenue is determined by multiplying monthly recurring revenue by 12. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we excluded the impact of revenue that we expect to generate from fixed-term contracts that are each associated with an existing account, are solely for additional temporary agents, and are not contemplated to last for the duration of the primary contract for the existing account from our determination of monthly recurring revenue. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\n\n\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, and expenses for hosting capabilities, primarily for third-party managed hosting services and costs associated with our self-managed colocation data centers. Cost of revenue also includes third-party license fees, payment processing fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, information technology, and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from paid customer accounts as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation would result in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 106,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 157,000 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts across their products, and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, further develop our product and platform solutions geared towards the entire customer experience, build brand recognition and scalable solutions for larger organizations, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business market, add new customers, generate additional revenue from our existing customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected expenditures that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including personnel costs, expenditures relating to hosting capabilities, leasehold improvements, and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of us experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur gross margin decreased by 0.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased hosting costs in connection with our transition to third-party managed hosting services while we continued to record depreciation for our existing self-managed colocation data centers. The overall decrease was partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized internal-use software due to timing of projects.\n(1) Consists of principal and interest payments. The $575 million in principal is due March 2023. For more information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, each Duet paid customer account was included in the number of paid customer accounts on Support, but not included in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, each Duet paid customer account is included once in the number of paid customer accounts on Support and once in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat in order to more accurately reflect how Zendesk's management views such metric. The effect of this change in methodology did not have a material impact on either the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat or the total number of paid customer accounts for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nBenefit from income taxes increased $11 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the recognition of a net income tax benefit of $14 million in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including employee-related expenditures from expansion of our headcount, hosting costs to support the growth in our customer accounts and continued customer expansion, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, features, and functionality, and costs related to building out our leased office facilities. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe are a software development company that provides software as a service solutions that are intended to help organizations and their customers build better experiences. Our customer experience solutions are built upon a modern architecture that enables us and our customers to rapidly innovate, adapt our technology in novel ways, and easily integrate with other products and applications. With our origins in customer service, we have evolved our offerings over time to product and platform solutions that work together to help organizations understand the broader customer journey, improve communications across all channels, and engage where and when it's needed most.\n (1) Share-based compensation expense was allocated as follows: \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States, income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and a non-cash benefit in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn March 2018, we issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due March 15, 2023 (refer to Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information). The impact of the convertible senior notes on our liquidity will depend on whether we elect to settle any conversions in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted convertible senior notes in cash. As of the date of this filing, we have received one request for conversion for an immaterial amount.\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\nInterest income increased $12 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in the amount of marketable securities from the proceeds received from our convertible senior notes. Interest expense increased $20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2018 of $529 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $561 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $21 million, and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $16 million, partially offset by the purchase of the capped call in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $64 million.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nintangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts using our solutions is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on Zendesk Support, exclusive of our legacy Starter plan, free trials, or other free services, the number of accounts on Chat, exclusive of free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts on all of our other products, exclusive of free trials and other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans for our solutions that vary in price based on functionality, type, and the amount of solution support we offer. We also offer a range of additional features that customers can purchase and add to their subscriptions. Certain arrangements provide for incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nOur quarterly expenses increased sequentially for all but one period presented, primarily due to increased compensation-related costs related to an increase in headcount in connection with the expansion of our business. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2019 included certain one-time general and administrative costs. Refer to Results of Operations above for further discussion.\nQuarterly Trends in Expenses\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $43 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $32 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $14 million.\nOur revenue in the first quarter of any fiscal year is negatively impacted relative to the preceding fourth quarter due to the fewer number of days in the first quarter over which we record subscription revenue as compared to the preceding fourth quarter.\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $38 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $15 million, driven by headcount growth, and a one-time termination-related charge of $3 million during 2019. The overall increase was also driven by costs associated with our acquisition of Smooch in 2019 including transaction costs of $3 million and a one-time share-based compensation charge of $3 million related to accelerated stock options of Smooch. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $3 million.\nWe utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia to host our services, support our infrastructure, and support certain research and development functions. In the first quarter of 2019, we completed the transition of our customers from self-managed colocation data centers to third-party managed hosting services.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $42 million, reflecting our net loss of $102 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $85 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $32 million, amortization of deferred costs of $14 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $13 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $52 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accrued liabilities, including accrued compensation, of $14 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $23 million, primarily related to sales commissions, and an increase accounts receivable of $21 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections.\n\nRevenue\nProvision for income taxes increased $13 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the recognition of a net income tax benefit of $14 million in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $22 million, or 27%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $15 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $3 million.\nCost of revenue increased $54 million, or 42%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased hosting costs of $21 million, increased employee compensation-related costs of $20 million, and increased third-party license fees of $7 million. The increase in hosting costs was driven by an increase in expenditures for third-party managed hosting services. The increase in employee compensation-related costs was driven by headcount growth. The increase in third-party license fees was driven by increased customer usage of certain product features. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $5 million, primarily related to facilities and information technology.\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: \nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through customer payments for subscription services, the issuance of our convertible senior notes, and public and private equity financings. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOverview\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our infrastructure, professional service organizations, and product support organically and through acquisitions. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to continue to incur capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capabilities of our solutions but also to increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of these investments. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our solutions or for certain subscription plans or integrations, we expect third-party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such solutions and subscription plans to remain significant over time.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to broaden the functionality of our existing solutions, to further integrate these solutions and services, and to introduce new solutions. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our customer base. We also expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 of $590 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $458 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of FutureSimple, net of cash acquired, of $79 million, purchases of property and equipment of $35 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $7 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\n(1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from marketable securities, foreign currency gains and losses, and interest expense from our convertible senior notes. Interest expense includes amortization of the debt discount, amortization of issuance costs, and contractual interest expense.\n(2) Primarily relates to third-party managed hosting services.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our solutions and services, and believe that our quarterly sales are affected by industry buying patterns. For example, we typically have customers who add flexible agents when they need more capacity during busy periods, especially in the fourth quarter, and then subsequently scale back in the first quarter of the following year. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may continue for the foreseeable future.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $105 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs, including amortization of capitalized commissions, of $72 million, driven by headcount growth, and an increase in marketing program costs of $8 million. The increase in marketing program costs was driven by increased volume of advertising activities. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $14 million.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\n\nOur principal commitments consist of our convertible senior notes, obligations under our operating leases for office space, and contractual commitments for third-party managed hosting and other support services. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAcquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying amounts of our acquired intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe had approximately 157,000 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019, including approximately 81,200 paid customer accounts on Support, approximately 42,600 paid customer accounts on Chat, and approximately 33,200 paid customer accounts on our other products. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline. We do not currently include in our number of paid accounts the number of accounts on Sunshine Conversations, our Sunshine platform messaging product, Zendesk Gather, our community forum software, or our legacy Smooch product.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our solutions, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales employees, developing our marketing teams, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nOperating Activities\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with software development for our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to develop our hosting capabilities primarily through expenditures for third-party managed hosting services. The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary based on our estimates of projected growth and planned use of hosting resources. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by efficiently utilizing our hosting and personnel resources to support the growth in our number of customers. In addition, we expect to incur amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the long-term, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of such costs.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019, 2018, and 2017\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue (in thousands):\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, hosting costs, office facilities, and marketing programs.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nFinancing Activities\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nCosts to Obtain Customer Contracts\nThrough December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our revenue was $816 million, $599 million, and $430 million, respectively, representing a 36% growth rate from 2018 to 2019 and a 39% growth rate from 2017 to 2018. For the years ended\nSales commissions are paid for initial contracts and expansions of existing customer contracts. Sales commissions and related expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. These costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of our customer contracts, our technology lifecycle, and other factors. Amortization expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense within our consolidated statement of operations. Sales commissions paid for contract renewals are not material.\n\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 we derived $389 million, or 48%, $289 million, or 48%, and $200 million, or 47%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we generated net losses of $170 million, $131 million, and $102 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses increased $45 million, or 39%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $36 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $6 million.\nIn limited circumstances, certain customers have arrangements that provide for a maximum number of users over the subscription term, with usage measured monthly. Incremental fees are incurred when the maximum number of users is exceeded. In determining the transaction price for these arrangements, we evaluate the expected usage and estimate any incremental fees that we are entitled to throughout the subscription term and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. In making these assessments, we constrain our estimates based on factors that could lead to a probable significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. Additionally, certain customers have arrangements that provide for unlimited users during the subscription term for a fixed fee. We recognize revenue from these arrangements on a ratable basis over the subscription term.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\nResearch and development expenses increased $47 million, or 30%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $34 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $8 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $89 million, reflecting our net loss of $170 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $157 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $39\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period provides sufficient context to accurately predict our future revenue for a given period of time.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $80 million, or 38%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs, including amortization of capitalized commissions, of $55 million, driven by headcount growth, and an increase in marketing program costs of $10 million. The increase in marketing program costs was driven by increased volume of advertising activities. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $11 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our solutions, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our solutions. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and the extent of our research and development expenses.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n*Not meaningful\n\n\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCapitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairments to internal-use software during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the consolidated level, as we operate as a single reporting unit.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, sales commissions, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include both online, and offline marketing initiatives, including digital advertising, such as search engine, paid social, e-mail and product marketing, content marketing, user events, conferences, corporate communications, web marketing and optimization, and outbound list and contact generation. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit, which we have determined to be three years.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 116% as of December 31, 2019. We expect that, among other factors, our continued focus on adding larger paid customer accounts at the time of addition and the growth in our revenue will result in an overall decline in our dollar-based net expansion rate over time as our aggregate annual recurring revenue grows.\nInterest income increased $5 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in the amount of marketable securities from the proceeds received from our convertible senior notes issued in March 2018. Interest expense increased $7 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nmillion, amortization of deferred costs of $32 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $25 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $78 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation of $33 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $50 million, primarily related to sales commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $50 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8 million.\n*Not meaningful\nThe effective tax rate for each period differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of not recognizing a deferred tax asset for U.S. losses due to having a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.\nWe believe in developing solutions that serve organizations of all sizes and across all industries. Our flagship product solution, Zendesk Support, provides organizations with the ability to track, prioritize, and solve customer support tickets across multiple channels, bringing customer information and interactions into one place. Our other widely available product solutions integrate with Support and include Zendesk Chat, Zendesk Talk, and Zendesk Guide. Chat is live chat software that provides a fast and responsive way for organizations to connect with their customers. Talk is cloud-based call center software that facilitates personal and productive phone support conversations between organizations and their customers. Guide is a self-service destination that organizations can use to provide articles, interactive forums, and a community that help an organization's customers help themselves. Additionally, we offer Zendesk Suite, an omnichannel offering which provides Support, Chat, Talk, and Guide together for a single price, Zendesk Sell, sales customer relationship management software that complements our mission in delivering solutions that provide a better customer experience, Zendesk Duet, an offering which provides Support and Sell together for a single price, Zendesk Sunshine, a customer relationship management platform which enables organizations to connect and integrate customer data generated through our product solutions, Zendesk Sunshine Conversations, a messaging platform solution that allows businesses to integrate messaging through social channels and directly interact and transact with customers, and Zendesk Gather, a product solution that enables companies to provide trusted and transparent support to customers through online community forums.", "item_7_text": "\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, accounting, and tax related services, other corporate expenses, and allocated shared costs.\nExisting customers may also expand their utilization of our products by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our products to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Other than usage of our products through our omnichannel subscription offering, each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. Other than paid accounts for Zendesk Connect, our marketing automation offering, an increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nCost of revenue increased $53 million, or 29%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $23 million, driven by headcount growth, increased hosting costs of $9 million, and increased third-party license fees of $6 million. The increase in hosting costs was driven by an increase in expenditures for third-party managed hosting services, partially offset by lower depreciation from our self-managed colocation data centers in connection with our transition to third-party managed hosting services. The increase in third-party license fees was driven by increased customer usage of certain product features. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $4 million, primarily related to facilities and information technology.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) Represents obligations to make payments under non-cancellable lease agreements for our corporate headquarters and worldwide offices.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, accounting, tax, and compliance-related services fees, insurance costs, and costs of executing significant transactions, including business acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nThe following unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements and include, in management's opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations data for these periods, in accordance with GAAP. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.\nQuarterly Trends in Revenue\nIn the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we began to offer an omnichannel subscription, which provides access to multiple solutions through a single paid customer account, Zendesk Suite, and in the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we began to offer a subscription which provides access to Sell and Support through a single paid customer account, Zendesk Duet. The number of Suite paid customer accounts are included in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat, and are not included in the number of paid customer accounts on Support or Chat.\nGross Margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of usage of third-party managed hosting resources, investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, increased share-based compensation expense, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, costs associated with capitalized internal-use software, and third-party license fees.\nRevenue increased $169 million, or 39%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of paid customer accounts, which grew from approximately 118,900 as of December 31, 2017 to approximately 136,600 as of December 31, 2018 and expansions from existing customers, as reflected in our dollar-based net expansion rate of 119% as of December 31, 2018. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes revenue from FutureSimple Inc., or FutureSimple.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2019 of $48 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $31 million and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $26 million, partially offset by payments for withholding taxes related to net share settlement of RSUs of $10 million.\nWe offer a range of subscription account plans for our solutions that vary in price based on functionality, type, and the amount of product support we offer. We also offer a range of additional features that customers can purchase and add to their subscriptions.\n\nCertain of our product solutions include service-level agreements warranting defined levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits for future services in the event that we fail to meet those levels. To date, we have not accrued for any material liabilities in our consolidated financial statements as a result of these service-level agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $845 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and agency securities.\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: \nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $79 million, reflecting our net loss of $131 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $119 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $37 million, amortization of deferred costs of $21 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $19 million, partially offset by income tax benefit related to convertible senior notes of $14 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $25 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $73 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accrued compensation of $15 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $41 million, primarily related to sales commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $30 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $11 million.\nSubscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue.\n\n\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOur quarterly revenue increased sequentially for each period presented, primarily due to the addition of new customer accounts and the continued expansion of existing customer accounts. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential growth in revenue will continue.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nKey Business Metrics\nOur gross margin increased by 1.6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by increased optimization of our hosting infrastructure.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nSeasonality\nRevenue increased $218 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of paid customer accounts, which grew from approximately 136,600 as of December 31, 2018 to approximately 157,000 as of December 31, 2019 and expansions from existing customers, as reflected in our dollar-based net expansion rate of 116% as of December 31, 2019. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes revenue from Smooch Technologies Holdings ULC, or Smooch.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2017 of $70 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $29 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of Outbound Solutions, Inc., net of cash acquired, of $16 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities and hosting equipment to maintain our self-managed colocation data centers, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2019 of $67 million was primarily attributable to cash paid for the acquisition of Smooch, net of cash acquired, of $71 million, purchases of property and equipment of $39 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $8 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $52 million, net purchases.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Zendesk Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. In addition, we generate revenue by providing additional features to certain of our subscription plans for a fee that is incremental to the base subscription rate for such plans. Subscription service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations or any other right of return. We record revenue net of sales or excise taxes.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our solutions. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans and the purchase of additional products. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our products. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, upgrades in subscription plans, and the purchase of additional products as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our legacy analytics product, our legacy Outbound product, our Sell product, our legacy Starter plan, Sunshine Conversations, Gather, our legacy Smooch product, free trials, or other free services into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our annual recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our products. Annual recurring revenue is determined by multiplying monthly recurring revenue by 12. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we excluded the impact of revenue that we expect to generate from fixed-term contracts that are each associated with an existing account, are solely for additional temporary agents, and are not contemplated to last for the duration of the primary contract for the existing account from our determination of monthly recurring revenue. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\n\n\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, and expenses for hosting capabilities, primarily for third-party managed hosting services and costs associated with our self-managed colocation data centers. Cost of revenue also includes third-party license fees, payment processing fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, information technology, and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nWe also derive revenue from implementation and training services, for which we recognize revenue based on proportional performance, and Talk usage, for which we recognize revenue based on usage.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from paid customer accounts as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate annual recurring revenue across our products from the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation would result in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 106,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 157,000 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts across their products, and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, further develop our product and platform solutions geared towards the entire customer experience, build brand recognition and scalable solutions for larger organizations, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business market, add new customers, generate additional revenue from our existing customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected expenditures that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including personnel costs, expenditures relating to hosting capabilities, leasehold improvements, and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of us experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur gross margin decreased by 0.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased hosting costs in connection with our transition to third-party managed hosting services while we continued to record depreciation for our existing self-managed colocation data centers. The overall decrease was partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized internal-use software due to timing of projects.\n(1) Consists of principal and interest payments. The $575 million in principal is due March 2023. For more information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, each Duet paid customer account was included in the number of paid customer accounts on Support, but not included in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, each Duet paid customer account is included once in the number of paid customer accounts on Support and once in the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat in order to more accurately reflect how Zendesk's management views such metric. The effect of this change in methodology did not have a material impact on either the number of paid customer accounts on products other than Support and Chat or the total number of paid customer accounts for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nBenefit from income taxes increased $11 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the recognition of a net income tax benefit of $14 million in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including employee-related expenditures from expansion of our headcount, hosting costs to support the growth in our customer accounts and continued customer expansion, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, features, and functionality, and costs related to building out our leased office facilities. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe are a software development company that provides software as a service solutions that are intended to help organizations and their customers build better experiences. Our customer experience solutions are built upon a modern architecture that enables us and our customers to rapidly innovate, adapt our technology in novel ways, and easily integrate with other products and applications. With our origins in customer service, we have evolved our offerings over time to product and platform solutions that work together to help organizations understand the broader customer journey, improve communications across all channels, and engage where and when it's needed most.\n (1) Share-based compensation expense was allocated as follows: \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States, income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and a non-cash benefit in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn March 2018, we issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due March 15, 2023 (refer to Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information). The impact of the convertible senior notes on our liquidity will depend on whether we elect to settle any conversions in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted convertible senior notes in cash. As of the date of this filing, we have received one request for conversion for an immaterial amount.\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\nInterest income increased $12 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in the amount of marketable securities from the proceeds received from our convertible senior notes. Interest expense increased $20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2018 of $529 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $561 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $21 million, and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $16 million, partially offset by the purchase of the capped call in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes of $64 million.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nintangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts using our solutions is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on Zendesk Support, exclusive of our legacy Starter plan, free trials, or other free services, the number of accounts on Chat, exclusive of free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts on all of our other products, exclusive of free trials and other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on Support and, to a lesser extent, Chat, Talk, Guide, and Sell, and includes related support services. We also derive revenue from Suite, which provides a subset of these solutions for a single price. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans for our solutions that vary in price based on functionality, type, and the amount of solution support we offer. We also offer a range of additional features that customers can purchase and add to their subscriptions. Certain arrangements provide for incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nOur quarterly expenses increased sequentially for all but one period presented, primarily due to increased compensation-related costs related to an increase in headcount in connection with the expansion of our business. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2019 included certain one-time general and administrative costs. Refer to Results of Operations above for further discussion.\nQuarterly Trends in Expenses\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2017 of $43 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $32 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $14 million.\nOur revenue in the first quarter of any fiscal year is negatively impacted relative to the preceding fourth quarter due to the fewer number of days in the first quarter over which we record subscription revenue as compared to the preceding fourth quarter.\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $38 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $15 million, driven by headcount growth, and a one-time termination-related charge of $3 million during 2019. The overall increase was also driven by costs associated with our acquisition of Smooch in 2019 including transaction costs of $3 million and a one-time share-based compensation charge of $3 million related to accelerated stock options of Smooch. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $3 million.\nWe utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia to host our services, support our infrastructure, and support certain research and development functions. In the first quarter of 2019, we completed the transition of our customers from self-managed colocation data centers to third-party managed hosting services.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $42 million, reflecting our net loss of $102 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $85 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $32 million, amortization of deferred costs of $14 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $13 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $52 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accrued liabilities, including accrued compensation, of $14 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $23 million, primarily related to sales commissions, and an increase accounts receivable of $21 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections.\n\nRevenue\nProvision for income taxes increased $13 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the recognition of a net income tax benefit of $14 million in 2018 related to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $22 million, or 27%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $15 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $3 million.\nCost of revenue increased $54 million, or 42%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased hosting costs of $21 million, increased employee compensation-related costs of $20 million, and increased third-party license fees of $7 million. The increase in hosting costs was driven by an increase in expenditures for third-party managed hosting services. The increase in employee compensation-related costs was driven by headcount growth. The increase in third-party license fees was driven by increased customer usage of certain product features. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $5 million, primarily related to facilities and information technology.\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: \nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through customer payments for subscription services, the issuance of our convertible senior notes, and public and private equity financings. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOverview\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our infrastructure, professional service organizations, and product support organically and through acquisitions. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to continue to incur capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capabilities of our solutions but also to increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of these investments. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our solutions or for certain subscription plans or integrations, we expect third-party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such solutions and subscription plans to remain significant over time.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to broaden the functionality of our existing solutions, to further integrate these solutions and services, and to introduce new solutions. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our customer base. We also expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 of $590 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $458 million, net of sales and maturities, cash paid for the acquisition of FutureSimple, net of cash acquired, of $79 million, purchases of property and equipment of $35 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements for newly leased office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $7 million related to the development of additional features and functionality for our platform.\n(1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from marketable securities, foreign currency gains and losses, and interest expense from our convertible senior notes. Interest expense includes amortization of the debt discount, amortization of issuance costs, and contractual interest expense.\n(2) Primarily relates to third-party managed hosting services.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our solutions and services, and believe that our quarterly sales are affected by industry buying patterns. For example, we typically have customers who add flexible agents when they need more capacity during busy periods, especially in the fourth quarter, and then subsequently scale back in the first quarter of the following year. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may continue for the foreseeable future.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $105 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs, including amortization of capitalized commissions, of $72 million, driven by headcount growth, and an increase in marketing program costs of $8 million. The increase in marketing program costs was driven by increased volume of advertising activities. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $14 million.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\n\nOur principal commitments consist of our convertible senior notes, obligations under our operating leases for office space, and contractual commitments for third-party managed hosting and other support services. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAcquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying amounts of our acquired intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe had approximately 157,000 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019, including approximately 81,200 paid customer accounts on Support, approximately 42,600 paid customer accounts on Chat, and approximately 33,200 paid customer accounts on our other products. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline. We do not currently include in our number of paid accounts the number of accounts on Sunshine Conversations, our Sunshine platform messaging product, Zendesk Gather, our community forum software, or our legacy Smooch product.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our solutions, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales employees, developing our marketing teams, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nOperating Activities\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with software development for our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to develop our hosting capabilities primarily through expenditures for third-party managed hosting services. The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary based on our estimates of projected growth and planned use of hosting resources. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by efficiently utilizing our hosting and personnel resources to support the growth in our number of customers. In addition, we expect to incur amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the long-term, although our gross margin may decrease in the near-term and may vary from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of such costs.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019, 2018, and 2017\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue (in thousands):\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, hosting costs, office facilities, and marketing programs.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nFinancing Activities\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nCosts to Obtain Customer Contracts\nThrough December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our revenue was $816 million, $599 million, and $430 million, respectively, representing a 36% growth rate from 2018 to 2019 and a 39% growth rate from 2017 to 2018. For the years ended\nSales commissions are paid for initial contracts and expansions of existing customer contracts. Sales commissions and related expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. These costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of our customer contracts, our technology lifecycle, and other factors. Amortization expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense within our consolidated statement of operations. Sales commissions paid for contract renewals are not material.\n\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 we derived $389 million, or 48%, $289 million, or 48%, and $200 million, or 47%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we generated net losses of $170 million, $131 million, and $102 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses increased $45 million, or 39%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $36 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $6 million.\nIn limited circumstances, certain customers have arrangements that provide for a maximum number of users over the subscription term, with usage measured monthly. Incremental fees are incurred when the maximum number of users is exceeded. In determining the transaction price for these arrangements, we evaluate the expected usage and estimate any incremental fees that we are entitled to throughout the subscription term and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. In making these assessments, we constrain our estimates based on factors that could lead to a probable significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. Additionally, certain customers have arrangements that provide for unlimited users during the subscription term for a fixed fee. We recognize revenue from these arrangements on a ratable basis over the subscription term.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\nResearch and development expenses increased $47 million, or 30%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $34 million, driven by headcount growth, and increased allocated shared costs of $8 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $89 million, reflecting our net loss of $170 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $157 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $39\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period provides sufficient context to accurately predict our future revenue for a given period of time.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $80 million, or 38%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs, including amortization of capitalized commissions, of $55 million, driven by headcount growth, and an increase in marketing program costs of $10 million. The increase in marketing program costs was driven by increased volume of advertising activities. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $11 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our solutions, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our solutions. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and the extent of our research and development expenses.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n*Not meaningful\n\n\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCapitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairments to internal-use software during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the consolidated level, as we operate as a single reporting unit.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, sales commissions, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include both online, and offline marketing initiatives, including digital advertising, such as search engine, paid social, e-mail and product marketing, content marketing, user events, conferences, corporate communications, web marketing and optimization, and outbound list and contact generation. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit, which we have determined to be three years.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 116% as of December 31, 2019. We expect that, among other factors, our continued focus on adding larger paid customer accounts at the time of addition and the growth in our revenue will result in an overall decline in our dollar-based net expansion rate over time as our aggregate annual recurring revenue grows.\nInterest income increased $5 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in the amount of marketable securities from the proceeds received from our convertible senior notes issued in March 2018. Interest expense increased $7 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the issuance of our convertible senior notes.\nmillion, amortization of deferred costs of $32 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $25 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $78 million due to sales growth and the timing of customer billings, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation of $33 million due to overall growth in our business and timing of payments. These sources of cash were offset by an increase in deferred costs of $50 million, primarily related to sales commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $50 million due to the timing of customer billings and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8 million.\n*Not meaningful\nThe effective tax rate for each period differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of not recognizing a deferred tax asset for U.S. losses due to having a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.\nWe believe in developing solutions that serve organizations of all sizes and across all industries.
