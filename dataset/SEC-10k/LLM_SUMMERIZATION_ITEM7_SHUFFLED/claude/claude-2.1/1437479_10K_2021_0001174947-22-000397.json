Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis represents management's view of the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial schedules included in this annual report. The financial condition and results of operations presented are not indicative of future performance.\nStrategic Overview\nENB Financial Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, are committed to remaining an independent community bank serving its market area and the greater communities surrounding Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Corporation's roots date back to the April 11, 1881 charter granted to Ephrata National Bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank's growth has been entirely organic over 140 years of existence. The Board and Management are committed to the principals and values that have served the company well over its history and the desire is to produce strong financial results that will ensure trust from the Bank's customers and favorable returns to the shareholders.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by a number of items resulting in strong financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and business responses thereto continues to impact customer behavior and balance sheet growth, but as of the date of this report there has not been significant negative impacts on earnings or credit. Customers have adapted to changes in behavior and the Corporation continues to seek ways to manage the structure of the balance sheet to achieve positive financial results now and in future time periods.\nThe Corporation recorded net income of $14,916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $2,617,000, or 21.3% increase over the year ended December 31, 2020. The earnings per share, basic and diluted, were $2.68 in 2021, compared to $2.20 in 2020, a 21.8% increase. The increase in the Corporation's 2021 earnings was caused primarily by growth in other income and net interest income, coupled with a decline in the provision for loan losses.\nNon-interest income excluding security and mortgage gains increased by $2,524,000, or 28.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to many positive trends such as higher trust income, higher commissions on debit card interchange fees, and lower mortgage servicing asset amortization. Mortgage gains were elevated for the second year in a row at $5,526,000, compared to $5,850,000 in 2020. Additionally, gains on debt and equity securities were $321,000, or 43.8% higher in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nThe Corporation's net interest income (NII) increased by $2,323,000, or 6.1%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in NII primarily resulted from an increase in interest on securities available for sale of $2,097,000, or 31.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. In addition, interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased by $826,000, or 21.5%, in 2021 compared to the prior year. The low interest rate environment has caused a rapid decline in asset yield, but also a decline in the cost of funds, which has resulted in these much lower levels of interest expense.\nThe Corporation recorded a $475,000 provision for loan losses in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The higher provision in 2020 was primarily caused by increasing the qualitative factors across industry lines to various degrees as a result of potential forward credit concerns related to COVID-19 and a higher specific allocation related to one commercial borrower that paid off in 2021.\nThe financial services industry uses two primary performance measurements to gauge performance: return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE). ROA measures how efficiently a bank generates income based on the amount of assets or size of a company. ROE measures the efficiency of a company in generating income based on the amount of equity or capital utilized.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>Key Performance Ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on Average Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.95% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on Average Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.16% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.16% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe results of the Corporation's operations are best explained by addressing in further detail the five major sections of the income statement, which are as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Net interest income </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Provision for loan losses </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Other income </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Operating expenses </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Income taxes </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion analyzes each of these five components.\nNet Interest Income\nNII represents the largest portion of the Corporation's operating income. In 2021, NII generated 69.4% of the Corporation's revenue stream, which consists of NII and non-interest income, compared to 71.3% in 2020. This decrease is a result of much higher levels of non-interest income in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall performance of the Corporation is highly dependent on the changes in NII since it comprises such a significant portion of operating income.\nThe following table shows a summary analysis of NII on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. For analytical purposes and throughout this discussion, yields, rates, and measurements such as NII, net interest spread, and net yield on interest earning assets are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE NII shown in both tables below will exceed the NII reported on the consolidated statements of income, which is not shown on an FTE basis.\nNet Interest Income\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax equivalent adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (fully taxable equivalent) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,062 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNII is the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense incurred on liabilities. Accordingly, two factors affect NII:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The rates charged on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The average balance of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNII is impacted by yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities. With the decrease in the short-term Federal Reserve rates in 2020, asset yields have declined significantly and the U.S. Treasury curve has been relatively flat.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nDuring 2021, longer-term U.S. Treasury rates did increase adding some slope to the yield curve, but asset yields are still constrained, which adds strain to NII and net interest margin (NIM).\nAs a result of a larger balance sheet in 2021, even with much lower asset yields, the Corporation's NII on a tax equivalent basis increased while the Corporation's margin decreased to 2.81% for year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.24% in 2020. Loan yields were lower in 2021 due to the 150 basis point Fed rate decline during the first quarter of 2020 as well as competitive pressure throughout 2020 and 2021. The Corporation's NII in 2021 increased over 2020, by $2,650,000, or 6.8%.\nSecurity yields will generally fluctuate more rapidly than loan yields based on changes to the U.S. Treasury rates and yield curve. With lower Treasury rates in 2020, security reinvestment had generally been occurring at lower yields. With slightly higher Treasury rates in 2021, security yields have increased slightly, but still remain compressed compared to years prior to 2020.\nThe Corporation's overall cost of funds, including non-interest bearing funds, remained stable through 2021 between 19 and 13 basis points. Core deposit interest rates were reduced throughout 2020 and time deposit rates have also decreased resulting in maturing time deposits repricing at lower levels or moving into core deposit products. The average balance of borrowings was slightly higher in 2021 compared to 2020, resulting in higher interest expense of $25,000. Additionally, the $20 million sub debt issuance beginning on December 30, 2020, carried a higher rate of interest than FHLB long-term advances. As a result, the total cost of borrowings increased $145,000 when comparing 2021 to 2020, resulting in a total increase in borrowings interest expense of $170,000.\nThe following table provides an analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income by distinguishing what changes were a result of average balance increases or decreases and what changes were a result of interest rate increases or decreases.\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n(TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td>

$2,650,000, a 6.8% increase over 2020. Total interest income increased $1,824,000, or 4.3%, while interest expense decreased $826,000, or 21.5%, from 2020 to 2021. The FTE interest income from the securities portfolio increased by $2,448,000, or 32.5%, while loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2%. During 2021, additional loan volume added $2,180,000 to net interest income, and lower yields primarily due to the Prime rate decreases in the first quarter of 2020, caused a $2,597,000 decrease, resulting in a net decrease of $417,000. Higher balances in the securities portfolio caused an increase of $3,983,000 in net interest income, while lower yields on securities caused a $1,535,000 decrease, resulting in a net increase of $2,448,000.\nThe average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by 18.0% during 2021, driven by the growth in deposit balances. Deposit rates decreased significantly throughout 2020 and 2021 more than offsetting the slightly higher interest expense caused by much higher balances of deposits. Lower interest rates contributed to $1,002,000 of interest expense reduction while higher balances only caused $6,000 of increased expense, resulting in a total decline in interest expense of $996,000.\nOut of all the Corporation's deposit types, interest-bearing demand deposits reprice the most rapidly, as these rates can be adjusted lower after a Federal Reserve rate decrease. Demand deposit interest expense decreased a total of $342,000 in 2021, with $441,000 due to lower rates, offsetting the higher balances that caused an increase of $99,000. Higher balances in savings accounts caused an increase of $16,000, while lower rates caused a decrease of $14,000, resulting in the net increase in interest expense of $2,000 on savings deposits. Time deposit balances declined throughout 2021, resulting in lower interest expense of $109,000, while lower rates caused a decline of $547,000, resulting in a net decrease of $656,000.\nThe average balance of total borrowings increased by $643,000, or 0.9%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The increase in total borrowings increased interest expense by $25,000. Higher rates on borrowings, driven by the subordinated debt issued at the end of 2020, resulted in higher interest expense of $145,000. The aggregate of these amounts was an increase in interest expense of $170,000 related to total borrowings.\nThe following table shows a more detailed analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis shown with all the major elements of the Corporation's balance sheet, which consists of interest earning and non-interest earning assets and interest bearing and non-interest bearing liabilities. Additionally, the analysis provides the net interest spread and the net yield on interest earning assets. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest spread has the deficiency of not giving credit for the non-interest bearing funds and capital used to fund a portion of the total interest earning assets. For this reason, management emphasizes the net yield on interest earning assets, also referred to as the net interest margin (NIM). The NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income on an FTE basis into total average interest earning assets. The NIM is generally the benchmark used by analysts to measure how efficiently a bank generates NII.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCOMPARATIVE AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND

Interest income on securities increased due to the volume growth which offset the declining yield due to lower market rates. Security reinvestment in 2021 has been occurring at slightly higher rates due to the increase in U.S. Treasury rates, but reinvestment throughout the majority of 2020 was at much lower yields. The sharp growth in the investment portfolio during a period of very low rates also contributed to the decline in average security yield. This large amount of new investment was caused by the significant influx of deposits, which caused excess liquidity.\nAverage balances on loans increased by $52.9 million, or 6.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. Loan yields declined by 31 basis points for the year and loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2% as a result of these lower yields.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased by $128.7 million, or 19.8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. While the average balance of time deposits did decrease for the year-to-date time periods, the average balance of demand and savings accounts increased significantly and more than offset the decline in time deposits. The interest rate paid on deposits decreased as well. This resulted in a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $996,000, or 46.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020.\nThe Corporation's average balance on borrowed funds increased marginally in 2021. The Corporation's borrowed funds consist of FHLB advances as well as subordinated debt issued in December of 2020 which was used to support capital growth for the Corporation. The subordinated debt issuance caused average borrowings to increase year-over-year, but the Corporation also paid off $10.6 million in FHLB advances during the year. The rate paid on borrowed funds increased by 22 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020 as a result of the issuance of subordinated debt which carries a 4.00% rate, significantly higher than the rate on FHLB advances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the net interest spread decreased by 36 basis points to 2.66%, compared to 3.02% for 2020. The effect of non-interest bearing funds decreased to 15 basis points from 22 basis points when comparing both years. The effect of non-interest bearing funds refers to the benefit gained from deposits on which the Corporation does not pay interest. As rates go lower, the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits decreases because there is less difference between non-interest bearing funds and interest bearing liabilities. The Corporation's NIM for 2021 was 2.81%, compared to 3.24% for 2020.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) provides for losses inherent in the loan portfolio as determined by a quarterly analysis and calculation of various factors related to the loan portfolio. The amount of the provision reflects the adjustment management determines necessary to ensure the ACL is adequate to cover any losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Corporation gives special attention to the level of underperforming loans when calculating the necessary provision for loan losses. The analysis of the credit loss allowance takes into consideration, among other things, the following factors:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>levels and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, and charge-offs, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>levels of classified loans, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>trends within the loan portfolio, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>changes in lending policies and procedures, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>experience of lending personnel and management oversight, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>national and local economic trends, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>concentrations of credit, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>changes in the quality of loan review and Board oversight, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>changes in the value of underlying collateral. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation recorded a provision of $475,000 in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The provision expense was elevated in 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19 and the deteriorating economic conditions that were expected to impact credit risk moving forward. The Corporation also provided $1.1 million in a specific allocation to one commercial borrower in 2020. This loan paid off during 2021 resulting in a reversal of that specific allocation and an overall reduction in provision expense. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.40%, compared to 1.50% at December 31, 2020.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement continues to evaluate the allowance for credit losses in relation to the growth or decline of the loan portfolio and its associated credit risk, and believes the provision and the allowance for credit losses are adequate to provide for future losses. For further discussion of the calculation, see the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section.\nOther Income\nOther income for 2021 was $17,881,000, an increase of $2,521,000, or 16.4%, compared to the $15,360,000 earned in 2020.

Service charges on deposit accounts has remained stable from the prior year and other fees have decreased by 10.7% as a result of lower fees on a third party sweep product in 2021. Commissions increased by $739,000, or 24.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, driven by higher debit card interchange commissions. Gains on debt and equity securities were higher in 2021 driven by solid gains on debt securities sold and gains recognized on the sale of equity securities and gains from the market value increases on equity securities. Mortgage gains were very strong in both years but were higher in 2020 due to slightly higher refinancing volume and better margins on loans sold. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance increased marginally year-over-year and other miscellaneous income was significantly higher due to improvements in net mortgage servicing income and investment adjustments that positively impacted this category of income.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table provides details of the Corporation's operating expenses for the last two years along with the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous year.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and employee benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equipment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising & marketing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computer software & data processing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shares tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(218 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and employee benefits are the largest category of operating expenses. For the year 2021, salaries and benefits increased $2,403,000, or 10.9%, compared to 2020. This was primarily due to merit and cost of living increases, additions to staff, and higher costs to replace employees who retired or left the organization due to nationwide staffing challenges. Occupancy and equipment expenses in total did not change significantly from the prior year. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by 11.0% which is typical as the Corporation grows and promotes new market areas and new products and services. Computer software and data processing expenses are growing at a rapid pace, 40.4% year-over year, as a result of higher technology costs and new bank-wide initiatives that rely heavily on software platforms. Shares tax expense is based on the Corporation's levels of shareholders' equity and has grown substantially in the past two years commensurate with the growth in shareholders' equity. Professional services expenses declined by 9.4% in 2021 compared to the prior year driven lower by a decline in outside services. Other operating expenses increased by 17.4% year-over-year primarily as a result of higher loan-related costs as well as higher FDIC insurance costs.\nIncome Taxes\nNearly all of the Corporation's income is taxed at a corporate rate of 21% for Federal income tax purposes. The Corporation is also subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax; however, very limited taxable activity is conducted at the corporate level. The Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, is not subject to state income tax, but does pay Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. The Bank Shares Tax expense appears on the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Income under operating expenses.\nCertain items of income are not subject to Federal income tax, such as tax-exempt interest income on loans and securities, and increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance; therefore, the effective income tax rate for the Corporation is lower than the stated tax rate. The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the Corporation's provision for income tax by the pre-tax income for the applicable period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of $2,620,000, compared to $2,285,000 for 2020. This increase in tax expense can be attributed to higher pretax earnings. The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 14.9% for 2021 and 15.7% for 2020. The Corporation's effective tax rate is lower than the 21% corporate rate as a result of tax-free assets that the Corporation holds on its balance sheet. The majority of the Corporation's tax-free assets are in the form of obligations of states and political subdivisions, referred to as municipal bonds. The Corporation also has a relatively small component of tax-free municipal loans.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Condition\nBalance Sheet Overview and Liquidity\nWe maintain liquid assets at adequate levels in order to meet the needs of our balance sheet. Our primary source of liquidity is core deposits and our available-for-sale investment portfolio both of which provide more than enough liquidity to fund loans to customers and any other funding needs.\nA portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings. At December 31, 2021, cash and equivalents amounted to $158.4 million, an increase of $63.5 million, or 66.9%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the sales, calls, and maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2021, we had borrowings outstanding from the FHLB of $44.2 million and subordinated debt of $19.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $491.4 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $99.0 million in firm loan commitments, $379.6 million in unused lines of credit, and open letters of credit of $12.8 million. Certificates of deposit due within one year totaled $63.6 million, or 55.8% of certificates of deposit. We believe, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us upon maturity and we have ample liquidity outside of these funds. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nAs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities was $195.2 million and $232.5 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $245.5 million and $269.9 million for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively primarily representing increases in our core deposits through the year.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Corporation classifies all of its debt securities as available for sale and reports the portfolio at fair market value. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $567.1 million of debt and equity securities, compared to $483.5 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $83.6 million, or 17.3%.\nThe largest movements within the securities portfolio were shaped by market factors, such as:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>slope of the U.S. Treasury curve and projected forward rates </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>interest spread versus U.S. Treasury rates on the various securities </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>pricing of the instruments, including supply and demand for the product </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>structure of the instruments, including duration and average life </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>portfolio weightings versus policy guidelines </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>credit risk of each instrument and risk-based capital considerations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Federal income tax considerations with regard to obligations of tax-free states and political subdivisions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation purchased $14.8 million of U.S. Treasuries during 2021 and held no Treasuries in 2020. U.S. Treasuries represent a safe credit at a market appropriate yield which added some diversity to the portfolio. The Corporation's U.S. government agency sector decreased by $25.3 million, or 46.6%, since December 31, 2020. Management had purchased $35.5 million of short-term discount notes at the end of 2020 to offset the Corporation's shares tax expense. These bonds were sold in the first quarter of 2021 and are responsible for the decline in this category. Management has increased the allocations of both asset-backed securities (ABS) and obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipals) since December 31, 2020, in order to better structure the portfolio to achieve higher yields while also protecting in preparation for a rates-up environment.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe Corporation's asset-backed securities (ABS) and municipal sectors have increased significantly since December 31, 2020, with ABS increasing $40.7 million, or 67.4%, and municipals increasing $53.7 million, or 27.7%. ABS securities are floating rate student loan pools which are instruments that will perform well in a rates-up environment and offset the interest rate risk of the longer fixed-rate municipal bonds. These securities provide a variable rate return materially above the overnight Federal funds rate in a safe investment with a risk rating very similar to that of U.S. Agency bonds. The asset-backed securities generally provide monthly principal and interest payments to complement the Corporation's ongoing cash flows. With liquidity and cash levels remaining high, management views the ABS sector as a safe, higher yielding option than cash, with the qualities of cash in a rates-up environment.\nObligations of states and political subdivisions, or municipal bonds, consist of both tax-free and taxable securities that generally provide the highest yield in the securities portfolio. They also carry the longest duration on average of any instrument in the securities portfolio. These instruments also experience significant fair market value gains and losses when interest rates decrease and increase. Municipal bonds represented 44.3% of the debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021, compared to 40.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Corporation's U.S. agency MBS and CMO sectors decreased in total by $23.0 million, or 21.7%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Management desires to maintain a portfolio of MBS and CMOs in order to assist in adding to and maintaining a stable five-year ladder of cash flows, which is important in providing stable liquidity to the balance sheet. U.S. agency MBS and CMO securities pay contractual monthly principal and interest, but are also subject to additional prepayment of principal.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Corporation's corporate bonds increased by $20.8 million, or 33.7%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Corporate bonds add diversity to the portfolio and provide strong yields for short maturities; however, by their very nature, corporate bonds carry a high level of credit risk should the entity experience financial difficulties.\nThe following table shows the weighted-average life and yield on the Corporation's debt securities by maturity intervals as of December 31, 2021, based on amortized cost. All of the Corporation's securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value; however, for purposes of this schedule they are shown at amortized cost. Securities are assigned to categories based on stated contractual maturity except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on anticipated payment periods.\nSECURITIES PORTFOLIO MATURITY ANALYSIS\n(DOLLARS IN

million, or 12.0%, from $811.0 million at December 31, 2020, to $908.0 million at December 31, 2021. Most major loan categories showed an increase in balances over the prior year but the majority of loan growth came from the commercial and consumer real estate categories with a decline in the commercial and industrial category as PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCommercial real estate loans increased to $400.8 million at December 31, 2021, from $342.1 million at December 31, 2020, a 17.2% increase. Commercial mortgages increased by $34.7 million, or 24.3%, agriculture mortgages increased by $27.7 million, or 15.7%, and commercial construction loans decreased by $3.8 million, or 16.2% from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021.\nThe consumer real estate category represents the largest group of loans for the Corporation. The consumer residential real estate category of total loans increased from $345.6 million on December 31, 2020, to $403.9 million on December 31, 2021, a 16.9% increase. This category includes closed-end fixed rate or adjustable rate residential real estate loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, including first and junior liens, and floating rate home equity loans. The first lien 1-4 family mortgages increased by $53.5 million, or 20.3%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The vast majority of the first lien 1-4 family closed end loans consist of single family personal first lien residential mortgages and home equity loans, with the remainder consisting of 1-4 family residential non-owner-occupied mortgages. During 2021, mortgage production increased 18.1% over the prior year. The increase in overall production was due to a large increase in portfolio production, which was up 73% over last year, while secondary market production decreased by 23%. The percentage of mortgage originations that went into the Corporation's held for investment mortgage portfolio increased to 63% compared to 55% in 2020. The interest rate environment throughout the year remained relatively stable and created a nice balance within our mix; 36% of volume in 2021 was purchase, 31% was residential construction lending, and 33% was refinance activity. The volume of mortgage production in 2021 led to a 20.7% increase in growth of the held for investment residential loan portfolio and a 22.8% increase in the servicing on behalf of others portfolio, with mortgage servicing rights growing to over $1.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the remainder of the residential real estate loans consisted of $11.2 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $75.7 million of variable rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). This compares to $10.7 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $71.3 million of HELOCs as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, combined, these two types of home equity loans increased from $82.0 million to $86.9 million, an increase of 6.0%.\nThe other area of commercial lending is non-real estate secured commercial lending, referred to as commercial and industrial lending. Commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate loans decreased from $129.2 million at December 31, 2020, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2021, a 15.4% decrease, primarily attributable to the forgiveness of PPP loans throughout 2021. Outside of PPP loans, the commercial and industrial category generally includes unsecured lines of credit, truck, equipment, and receivable and inventory loans, in addition to tax-free loans to municipalities. PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021, and ended the year with a balance of only $11.3 million. Management expects that virtually all of the remaining balance will be forgiven during 2022.\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate represent a very small portion of the Corporation's loan portfolio, at $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These loans consist of personal loans, automobile loans, and other consumer-related loans.\nThe following tables show the maturities for the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, by time frame for the major categories, and also the loans, which are floating or fixed, maturing after one year.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLOAN MATURITIES\n(DOLLARS IN

Discussion and Analysis\nThe majority of the Corporation's fixed-rate loans have a maturity date longer than five years. The primary reason for the longevity of the portfolio is the high percentage of real estate loans, which typically have maturities of 15 or 20 years. Out of all the loans due after one year, $268.9 million, or 31.5%, are fixed-rate loans as of December 31, 2021. These loans will not reprice to a higher or lower interest rate unless they mature or are refinanced by the borrower. The remaining $584.0 million, or 68.5% of loans due after one year, are made up of loans that are true floating loans and loans that will reprice at a predetermined time in the amortization of the loan. True floating rate loans that would immediately reprice according to changes in the Prime rate are favorable in reducing the Corporation's total exposure to interest rate risk and fair value risk should interest rates increase. It is likely the borrowing habits of commercial borrowers will change if the Fed raises rates in the near term. More commercial customers will desire to lock into an initial fixed interest rate period to avoid future rate increases. However, if the customer perceives rates will remain low for an extended period of time, there is a greater likelihood that borrowers will opt for variable rate loans in order to get the best available pricing.\nFor more details regarding how the length of the loan portfolio and its repricing affects interest rate risk, please see", "item_7_truncated": "ENB FINANCIAL CORP\nDuring 2021, longer-term U.S. Treasury rates did increase adding some slope to the yield curve, but asset yields are still constrained, which adds strain to NII and net interest margin (NIM).\nNII is impacted by yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities. With the decrease in the short-term Federal Reserve rates in 2020, asset yields have declined significantly and the U.S. Treasury curve has been relatively flat.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

following table shows a summary analysis of NII on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis.

The FTE NII shown in both tables below will exceed the NII reported on the consolidated statements of income, which is not shown on an FTE basis.\nSecurity yields will generally fluctuate more rapidly than loan yields based on changes to the U.S. Treasury rates and yield curve. With lower Treasury rates in 2020, security reinvestment had generally been occurring at lower yields. With slightly higher Treasury rates in 2021, security yields have increased slightly, but still remain compressed compared to years prior to 2020.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In 2021, NII generated 69.4% of the Corporation's revenue stream, which consists of NII and non-interest income, compared to 71.3% in 2020. This decrease is a result of much higher levels of non-interest income in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall performance of the Corporation is highly dependent on the changes in NII since it comprises such a significant portion of operating income.\n\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and employee benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equipment expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising & marketing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computer software & data processing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shares tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(218 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate represent a very small portion of the Corporation's loan portfolio, at $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These loans consist of personal loans, automobile loans, and other consumer-related loans.\nSalaries and employee benefits are the largest category of operating expenses. For the year 2021, salaries and benefits increased $2,403,000, or 10.9%, compared to 2020. This was primarily due to merit and cost of living increases, additions to staff, and higher costs to replace employees who retired or left the organization due to nationwide staffing challenges. Occupancy and equipment expenses in total did not change significantly from the prior year. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by 11.0% which is typical as the Corporation grows and promotes new market areas and new products and services. Computer software and data processing expenses are growing at a rapid pace, 40.4% year-over year, as a result of higher technology costs and new bank-wide initiatives that rely heavily on software platforms. Shares tax expense is based on the Corporation's levels of shareholders' equity and has grown substantially in the past two years commensurate with the growth in shareholders' equity. Professional services expenses declined by 9.4% in 2021 compared to the prior year driven lower by a decline in outside services. Other operating expenses increased by 17.4% year-over-year primarily as a result of higher loan-related costs as well as higher FDIC insurance costs.\n\nCertain items of income are not subject to Federal income tax, such as tax-exempt interest income on loans and securities, and increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance; therefore, the effective income tax rate for the Corporation is lower than the stated tax rate. The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the Corporation's provision for income tax by the pre-tax income for the applicable period.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within

2020. The effect of non-interest bearing funds decreased to 15 basis points from 22 basis points when comparing both years. The effect of non-interest bearing funds refers to the benefit gained from deposits on which the Corporation does not pay interest. As rates go lower, the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits decreases because there is less difference between non-interest bearing funds and interest bearing liabilities. The Corporation's NIM for 2021 was 2.81%, compared to 3.24% for 2020.\nThe average balance of total borrowings increased by $643,000, or 0.9%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The increase in total borrowings increased interest expense by $25,000. Higher rates on borrowings, driven by the subordinated debt issued at the end of 2020, resulted in higher interest expense of $145,000. The aggregate of these amounts was an increase in interest expense of $170,000 related to total borrowings.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 Federal income tax considerations with regard to obligations of tax-free states and political subdivisions. \n\nThe majority of the Corporation's fixed-rate loans have a maturity date longer than five years. The primary reason for the longevity of the portfolio is the high percentage of real estate loans, which typically have maturities of 15 or 20 years. Out of all the loans due after one year, $268.9 million, or 31.5%, are fixed-rate loans as of December 31, 2021. These loans will not reprice to a higher or lower interest rate unless they mature or are refinanced by the borrower. The remaining $584.0 million, or 68.5% of loans due after one year, are made up of loans that are true floating loans and loans that will reprice at a predetermined time in the amortization of the loan. True floating rate loans that would immediately reprice according to changes in the Prime rate are favorable in reducing the Corporation's total exposure to interest rate risk and fair value risk should interest rates increase. It is likely the borrowing habits of commercial borrowers will change if the Fed raises rates in the near term. More commercial customers will desire to lock into an initial fixed interest rate period to avoid future rate increases. However, if the customer perceives rates will remain low for an extended period of time, there is a greater likelihood that borrowers will opt for variable rate loans in order to get the best available pricing.\n \u00b7 levels of classified loans, \n\nSECURITIES PORTFOLIO MATURITY ANALYSIS\nNearly all of the Corporation's income is taxed at a corporate rate of 21% for Federal income tax purposes. The Corporation is also subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax; however, very limited taxable activity is conducted at the corporate level. The Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, is not subject to state income tax, but does pay Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. The Bank Shares Tax expense appears on the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Income under operating expenses.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nAs a result of a larger balance sheet in 2021, even with much lower asset yields, the Corporation's NII on a tax equivalent basis increased while the Corporation's margin decreased to 2.81% for year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.24% in 2020. Loan yields were lower in 2021 due to the 150 basis point Fed rate decline during the first quarter of 2020 as well as competitive pressure throughout 2020 and 2021. The Corporation's NII in 2021 increased over 2020, by $2,650,000, or 6.8%.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased by $128.7 million, or 19.8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. While the average balance of time deposits did decrease for the year-to-date time periods, the average balance of demand and savings accounts increased significantly and more than offset the decline in time deposits. The interest rate paid on deposits decreased as well. This resulted in a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $996,000, or 46.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020.\nThe Corporation's average balance on securities increased by $202.7 million, or 58.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020 and the tax equivalent yield on investments declined by 36 basis points. Interest income on securities increased due to the volume growth which offset the declining yield due to lower market rates. Security reinvestment in 2021 has been occurring at slightly higher rates due to the increase in U.S. Treasury rates, but reinvestment throughout the majority of 2020 was at much lower yields. The sharp growth in the investment portfolio during a period of very low rates also contributed to the decline in average security yield. This large amount of new investment was caused by the significant influx of deposits, which caused excess liquidity.\nManagement continues to evaluate the allowance for credit losses in relation to the growth or decline of the loan portfolio and its associated credit risk, and believes the provision and the allowance for credit losses are adequate to provide for future losses. For further discussion of the calculation, see the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section.\nThe Corporation recorded a $475,000 provision for loan losses in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The higher provision in 2020 was primarily caused by increasing the qualitative factors across industry lines to various degrees as a result of potential forward credit concerns related to COVID-19 and a higher specific allocation related to one commercial borrower that paid off in 2021.\n \u00b7 Operating expenses \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u00b7 interest spread versus U.S. Treasury rates on the various securities \nOut of all the Corporation's deposit types, interest-bearing demand deposits reprice the most rapidly, as these rates can be adjusted lower after a Federal Reserve rate decrease. Demand deposit interest expense decreased a total of $342,000 in 2021, with $441,000 due to lower rates, offsetting the higher balances that caused an increase of $99,000. Higher balances in savings accounts caused an increase of $16,000, while lower rates caused a decrease of $14,000, resulting in the net increase in interest expense of $2,000 on savings deposits. Time deposit balances declined throughout 2021, resulting in lower interest expense of $109,000, while lower rates caused a decline of $547,000, resulting in a net decrease of $656,000.\nENB Financial Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, are committed to remaining an independent community bank serving its market area and the greater communities surrounding Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Corporation's roots date back to the April 11, 1881 charter granted to Ephrata National Bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank's growth has been entirely organic over 140 years of existence. The Board and Management are committed to the principals and values that have served the company well over its history and the desire is to produce strong financial results that will ensure trust from the Bank's customers and favorable returns to the shareholders.\nThe results of the Corporation's operations are best explained by addressing in further detail the five major sections of the income statement, which are as follows:\nOther income for 2021 was $17,881,000, an increase of $2,521,000, or 16.4%, compared to the $15,360,000 earned in 2020. The following table details the categories that comprise other income.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 changes in the value of underlying collateral. \nNet loans outstanding increased $97.0 million, or 12.0%, from $811.0 million at December 31, 2020, to $908.0 million at December 31, 2021. Most major loan categories showed an increase in balances over the prior year but the majority of loan growth came from the commercial and consumer real estate categories with a decline in the commercial and industrial category as PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021.\nIn 2021, the Corporation's NII on an FTE basis increased by $2,650,000, a 6.8% increase over 2020. Total interest income increased $1,824,000, or 4.3%, while interest expense decreased $826,000, or 21.5%, from 2020 to 2021. The FTE interest income from the securities portfolio increased by $2,448,000, or 32.5%, while loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2%. During 2021, additional loan volume added $2,180,000 to net interest income, and lower yields primarily due to the Prime rate decreases in the first quarter of 2020, caused a $2,597,000 decrease, resulting in a net decrease of $417,000. Higher balances in the securities portfolio caused an increase of $3,983,000 in net interest income, while lower yields on securities caused a $1,535,000 decrease, resulting in a net increase of $2,448,000.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 changes in lending policies and procedures, \nENB FINANCIAL CORP\n \u00b7 trends within the loan portfolio, \nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of $2,620,000, compared to $2,285,000 for 2020. This increase in tax expense can be attributed to higher pretax earnings. The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 14.9% for 2021 and 15.7% for 2020. The Corporation's effective tax rate is lower than the 21% corporate rate as a result of tax-free assets that the Corporation holds on its balance sheet. The majority of the Corporation's tax-free assets are in the form of obligations of states and political subdivisions, referred to as municipal bonds. The Corporation also has a relatively small component of tax-free municipal loans.\n (a) Includes balances of non-accrual loans and the recognition of any related interest income. Average balances also include net deferred loan costs of $1,755,000 in 2021, $1,277,000 in 2020, and $1,753,000 in 2019. Such fees recognized through income and included in the interest amounts totaled $1,201,000 in 2021, $993,000 in 2020, and ($523,000) in 2019. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe Corporation classifies all of its debt securities as available for sale and reports the portfolio at fair market value. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $567.1 million of debt and equity securities, compared to $483.5 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $83.6 million, or 17.3%.\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\n \u00b7 portfolio weightings versus policy guidelines \n (b) Net interest spread is the arithmetic difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. \n \u00b7 structure of the instruments, including duration and average life \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Corporation's corporate bonds increased by $20.8 million, or 33.7%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Corporate bonds add diversity to the portfolio and provide strong yields for short maturities; however, by their very nature, corporate bonds carry a high level of credit risk should the entity experience financial difficulties.\nThe largest movements within the securities portfolio were shaped by market factors, such as:\nWe maintain liquid assets at adequate levels in order to meet the needs of our balance sheet. Our primary source of liquidity is core deposits and our available-for-sale investment portfolio both of which provide more than enough liquidity to fund loans to customers and any other funding needs.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nThe following discussion and analysis represents management's view of the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial schedules included in this annual report. The financial condition and results of operations presented are not indicative of future performance.\n \u00b7 credit risk of each instrument and risk-based capital considerations \n(TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nNon-interest income excluding security and mortgage gains increased by $2,524,000, or 28.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to many positive trends such as higher trust income, higher commissions on debit card interchange fees, and lower mortgage servicing asset amortization. Mortgage gains were elevated for the second year in a row at $5,526,000, compared to $5,850,000 in 2020. Additionally, gains on debt and equity securities were $321,000, or 43.8% higher in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nThe following table provides details of the Corporation's operating expenses for the last two years along with the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous year.\n \u00b7 experience of lending personnel and management oversight, \n \u00b7 Other income \n \u00b7 prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations \nThe following table shows a more detailed analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis shown with all the major elements of the Corporation's balance sheet, which consists of interest earning and non-interest earning assets and interest bearing and non-interest bearing liabilities. Additionally, the analysis provides the net interest spread and the net yield on interest earning assets. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest spread has the deficiency of not giving credit for the non-interest bearing funds and capital used to fund a portion of the total interest earning assets. For this reason, management emphasizes the net yield on interest earning assets, also referred to as the net interest margin (NIM). The NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income on an FTE basis into total average interest earning assets. The NIM is generally the benchmark used by analysts to measure how efficiently a bank generates NII.\nThe Corporation recorded net income of $14,916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $2,617,000, or 21.3% increase over the year ended December 31, 2020. The earnings per share, basic and diluted, were $2.68 in 2021, compared to $2.20 in 2020, a 21.8% increase. The increase in the Corporation's 2021 earnings was caused primarily by growth in other income and net interest income, coupled with a decline in the provision for loan losses.\n\n (d) Securities recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized holding gains and losses are included in non-interest earning assets. \nThe Corporation purchased $14.8 million of U.S. Treasuries during 2021 and held no Treasuries in 2020. U.S. Treasuries represent a safe credit at a market appropriate yield which added some diversity to the portfolio. The Corporation's U.S. government agency sector decreased by $25.3 million, or 46.6%, since December 31, 2020. Management had purchased $35.5 million of short-term discount notes at the end of 2020 to offset the Corporation's shares tax expense. These bonds were sold in the first quarter of 2021 and are responsible for the decline in this category. Management has increased the allocations of both asset-backed securities (ABS) and obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipals) since December 31, 2020, in order to better structure the portfolio to achieve higher yields while also protecting in preparation for a rates-up environment.\nAverage balances on loans increased by $52.9 million, or 6.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. Loan yields declined by 31 basis points for the year and loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2% as a result of these lower yields.\n \u00b7 levels and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, and charge-offs, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 The average balance of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities \nThe Corporation's average balance on borrowed funds increased marginally in 2021. The Corporation's borrowed funds consist of FHLB advances as well as subordinated debt issued in December of 2020 which was used to support capital growth for the Corporation. The subordinated debt issuance caused average borrowings to increase year-over-year, but the Corporation also paid off $10.6 million in FHLB advances during the year. The rate paid on borrowed funds increased by 22 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020 as a result of the issuance of subordinated debt which carries a 4.00% rate, significantly higher than the rate on FHLB advances.\n\nFIXED AND FLOATING RATE LOANS DUE AFTER ONE YEAR\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's asset-backed securities (ABS) and municipal sectors have increased significantly since December 31, 2020, with ABS increasing $40.7 million, or 67.4%, and municipals increasing $53.7 million, or 27.7%. ABS securities are floating rate student loan pools which are instruments that will perform well in a rates-up environment and offset the interest rate risk of the longer fixed-rate municipal bonds. These securities provide a variable rate return materially above the overnight Federal funds rate in a safe investment with a risk rating very similar to that of U.S. Agency bonds. The asset-backed securities generally provide monthly principal and interest payments to complement the Corporation's ongoing cash flows. With liquidity and cash levels remaining high, management views the ABS sector as a safe, higher yielding option than cash, with the qualities of cash in a rates-up environment.\n \u00b7 Net interest income \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLoans\n\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nThe average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by 18.0% during 2021, driven by the growth in deposit balances. Deposit rates decreased significantly throughout 2020 and 2021 more than offsetting the slightly higher interest expense caused by much higher balances of deposits. Lower interest rates contributed to $1,002,000 of interest expense reduction while higher balances only caused $6,000 of increased expense, resulting in a total decline in interest expense of $996,000.\nThe Corporation's U.S. agency MBS and CMO sectors decreased in total by $23.0 million, or 21.7%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Management desires to maintain a portfolio of MBS and CMOs in order to assist in adding to and maintaining a stable five-year ladder of cash flows, which is important in providing stable liquidity to the balance sheet. U.S. agency MBS and CMO securities pay contractual monthly principal and interest, but are also subject to additional prepayment of principal.\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\n \u00b7 changes in the quality of loan review and Board oversight, and \n \u00b7 concentrations of credit, \nFor more details regarding how the length of the loan portfolio and its repricing affects interest rate risk, please see\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nThe Corporation's overall cost of funds, including non-interest bearing funds, remained stable through 2021 between 19 and 13 basis points. Core deposit interest rates were reduced throughout 2020 and time deposit rates have also decreased resulting in maturing time deposits repricing at lower levels or moving into core deposit products. The average balance of borrowings was slightly higher in 2021 compared to 2020, resulting in higher interest expense of $25,000. Additionally, the $20 million sub debt issuance beginning on December 30, 2020, carried a higher rate of interest than FHLB long-term advances. As a result, the total cost of borrowings increased $145,000 when comparing 2021 to 2020, resulting in a total increase in borrowings interest expense of $170,000.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nOverview\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Condition\nNII is the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense incurred on liabilities. Accordingly, two factors affect NII:\nLOAN MATURITIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTrust and investment services income increased by 19.7% from 2020 to 2021 primarily as a result of higher income on the non-deposit investment services side which increased by $281,000, or 38.6%. Service charges on deposit accounts has remained stable from the prior year and other fees have decreased by 10.7% as a result of lower fees on a third party sweep product in 2021. Commissions increased by $739,000, or 24.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, driven by higher debit card interchange commissions. Gains on debt and equity securities were higher in 2021 driven by solid gains on debt securities sold and gains recognized on the sale of equity securities and gains from the market value increases on equity securities. Mortgage gains were very strong in both years but were higher in 2020 due to slightly higher refinancing volume and better margins on loans sold. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance increased marginally year-over-year and other miscellaneous income was significantly higher due to improvements in net mortgage servicing income and investment adjustments that positively impacted this category of income.\nThe following table shows the weighted-average life and yield on the Corporation's debt securities by maturity intervals as of December 31, 2021, based on amortized cost. All of the Corporation's securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value; however, for purposes of this schedule they are shown at amortized cost. Securities are assigned to categories based on stated contractual maturity except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on anticipated payment periods.\nStrategic Overview\nAs of December 31, 2021, the remainder of the residential real estate loans consisted of $11.2 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $75.7 million of variable rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). This compares to $10.7 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $71.3 million of HELOCs as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, combined, these two types of home equity loans increased from $82.0 million to $86.9 million, an increase of 6.0%.\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) provides for losses inherent in the loan portfolio as determined by a quarterly analysis and calculation of various factors related to the loan portfolio. The amount of the provision reflects the adjustment management determines necessary to ensure the ACL is adequate to cover any losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Corporation gives special attention to the level of underperforming loans when calculating the necessary provision for loan losses. The analysis of the credit loss allowance takes into consideration, among other things, the following factors:\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nBalance Sheet Overview and Liquidity\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by a number of items resulting in strong financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and business responses thereto continues to impact customer behavior and balance sheet growth, but as of the date of this report there has not been significant negative impacts on earnings or credit. Customers have adapted to changes in behavior and the Corporation continues to seek ways to manage the structure of the balance sheet to achieve positive financial results now and in future time periods.\n \u00b7 external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements, \nThe financial services industry uses two primary performance measurements to gauge performance: return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE). ROA measures how efficiently a bank generates income based on the amount of assets or size of a company. ROE measures the efficiency of a company in generating income based on the amount of equity or capital utilized.\n \u00b7 Income taxes \nOTHER INCOME\n\n \u00b7 The rates charged on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities \nAt December 31, 2021, we had $491.4 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $99.0 million in firm loan commitments, $379.6 million in unused lines of credit, and open letters of credit of $12.8 million. Certificates of deposit due within one year totaled $63.6 million, or 55.8% of certificates of deposit. We believe, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us upon maturity and we have ample liquidity outside of these funds. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nThe other area of commercial lending is non-real estate secured commercial lending, referred to as commercial and industrial lending. Commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate loans decreased from $129.2 million at December 31, 2020, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2021, a 15.4% decrease, primarily attributable to the forgiveness of PPP loans throughout 2021. Outside of PPP loans, the commercial and industrial category generally includes unsecured lines of credit, truck, equipment, and receivable and inventory loans, in addition to tax-free loans to municipalities. PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021, and ended the year with a balance of only $11.3 million. Management expects that virtually all of the remaining balance will be forgiven during 2022.\nA portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings. At December 31, 2021, cash and equivalents amounted to $158.4 million, an increase of $63.5 million, or 66.9%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the sales, calls, and maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2021, we had borrowings outstanding from the FHLB of $44.2 million and subordinated debt of $19.7 million.\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's net interest income (NII) increased by $2,323,000, or 6.1%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in NII primarily resulted from an increase in interest on securities available for sale of $2,097,000, or 31.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. In addition, interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased by $826,000, or 21.5%, in 2021 compared to the prior year. The low interest rate environment has caused a rapid decline in asset yield, but also a decline in the cost of funds, which has resulted in these much lower levels of interest expense.\nThe consumer real estate category represents the largest group of loans for the Corporation. The consumer residential real estate category of total loans increased from $345.6 million on December 31, 2020, to $403.9 million on December 31, 2021, a 16.9% increase. This category includes closed-end fixed rate or adjustable rate residential real estate loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, including first and junior liens, and floating rate home equity loans. The first lien 1-4 family mortgages increased by $53.5 million, or 20.3%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The vast majority of the first lien 1-4 family closed end loans consist of single family personal first lien residential mortgages and home equity loans, with the remainder consisting of 1-4 family residential non-owner-occupied mortgages. During 2021, mortgage production increased 18.1% over the prior year. The increase in overall production was due to a large increase in portfolio production, which was up 73% over last year, while secondary market production decreased by 23%. The percentage of mortgage originations that went into the Corporation's held for investment mortgage portfolio increased to 63% compared to 55% in 2020. The interest rate environment throughout the year remained relatively stable and created a nice balance within our mix; 36% of volume in 2021 was purchase, 31% was residential construction lending, and 33% was refinance activity. The volume of mortgage production in 2021 led to a 20.7% increase in growth of the held for investment residential loan portfolio and a 22.8% increase in the servicing on behalf of others portfolio, with mortgage servicing rights growing to over $1.7 million.\nThe Corporation recorded a provision of $475,000 in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The provision expense was elevated in 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19 and the deteriorating economic conditions that were expected to impact credit risk moving forward. The Corporation also provided $1.1 million in a specific allocation to one commercial borrower in 2020. This loan paid off during 2021 resulting in a reversal of that specific allocation and an overall reduction in provision expense. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.40%, compared to 1.50% at December 31, 2020.\n \u00b7 Provision for loan losses \nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nObligations of states and political subdivisions, or municipal bonds, consist of both tax-free and taxable securities that generally provide the highest yield in the securities portfolio. They also carry the longest duration on average of any instrument in the securities portfolio. These instruments also experience significant fair market value gains and losses when interest rates decrease and increase. Municipal bonds represented 44.3% of the debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021, compared to 40.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\n\nThe following discussion analyzes each of these five components.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nAs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities was $195.2 million and $232.5 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $245.5 million and $269.9 million for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively primarily representing increases in our core deposits through the year.\nThe following table provides an analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income by distinguishing what changes were a result of average balance increases or decreases and what changes were a result of interest rate increases or decreases.\n (c) Net yield, also referred to as net interest margin, is computed by dividing net interest income (FTE) by total interest earning assets. \n \u00b7 slope of the U.S. Treasury curve and projected forward rates \nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 national and local economic trends, \nInvestment Securities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis", "item_7_text": "ENB FINANCIAL CORP\nDuring 2021, longer-term U.S. Treasury rates did increase adding some slope to the yield curve, but asset yields are still constrained, which adds strain to NII and net interest margin (NIM).\nNII is impacted by yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities. With the decrease in the short-term Federal Reserve rates in 2020, asset yields have declined significantly and the U.S. Treasury curve has been relatively flat.\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n \u00b7 pricing of the instruments, including supply and demand for the product \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOther Income\nThe following tables show the maturities for the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, by time frame for the major categories, and also the loans, which are floating or fixed, maturing after one year.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nThe following table shows a summary analysis of NII on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. For analytical purposes and throughout this discussion, yields, rates, and measurements such as NII, net interest spread, and net yield on interest earning assets are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE NII shown in both tables below will exceed the NII reported on the consolidated statements of income, which is not shown on an FTE basis.\nSecurity yields will generally fluctuate more rapidly than loan yields based on changes to the U.S. Treasury rates and yield curve. With lower Treasury rates in 2020, security reinvestment had generally been occurring at lower yields. With slightly higher Treasury rates in 2021, security yields have increased slightly, but still remain compressed compared to years prior to 2020.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nIncome Taxes\nCommercial real estate loans increased to $400.8 million at December 31, 2021, from $342.1 million at December 31, 2020, a 17.2% increase. Commercial mortgages increased by $34.7 million, or 24.3%, agriculture mortgages increased by $27.7 million, or 15.7%, and commercial construction loans decreased by $3.8 million, or 16.2% from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021.\nNII represents the largest portion of the Corporation's operating income. In 2021, NII generated 69.4% of the Corporation's revenue stream, which consists of NII and non-interest income, compared to 71.3% in 2020. This decrease is a result of much higher levels of non-interest income in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall performance of the Corporation is highly dependent on the changes in NII since it comprises such a significant portion of operating income.\n\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate represent a very small portion of the Corporation's loan portfolio, at $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These loans consist of personal loans, automobile loans, and other consumer-related loans.\nSalaries and employee benefits are the largest category of operating expenses. For the year 2021, salaries and benefits increased $2,403,000, or 10.9%, compared to 2020. This was primarily due to merit and cost of living increases, additions to staff, and higher costs to replace employees who retired or left the organization due to nationwide staffing challenges. Occupancy and equipment expenses in total did not change significantly from the prior year. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by 11.0% which is typical as the Corporation grows and promotes new market areas and new products and services. Computer software and data processing expenses are growing at a rapid pace, 40.4% year-over year, as a result of higher technology costs and new bank-wide initiatives that rely heavily on software platforms. Shares tax expense is based on the Corporation's levels of shareholders' equity and has grown substantially in the past two years commensurate with the growth in shareholders' equity. Professional services expenses declined by 9.4% in 2021 compared to the prior year driven lower by a decline in outside services. Other operating expenses increased by 17.4% year-over-year primarily as a result of higher loan-related costs as well as higher FDIC insurance costs.\n\nCertain items of income are not subject to Federal income tax, such as tax-exempt interest income on loans and securities, and increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance; therefore, the effective income tax rate for the Corporation is lower than the stated tax rate. The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the Corporation's provision for income tax by the pre-tax income for the applicable period.\nCOMPARATIVE AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST INCOME\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the net interest spread decreased by 36 basis points to 2.66%, compared to 3.02% for 2020. The effect of non-interest bearing funds decreased to 15 basis points from 22 basis points when comparing both years. The effect of non-interest bearing funds refers to the benefit gained from deposits on which the Corporation does not pay interest. As rates go lower, the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits decreases because there is less difference between non-interest bearing funds and interest bearing liabilities. The Corporation's NIM for 2021 was 2.81%, compared to 3.24% for 2020.\nThe average balance of total borrowings increased by $643,000, or 0.9%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The increase in total borrowings increased interest expense by $25,000. Higher rates on borrowings, driven by the subordinated debt issued at the end of 2020, resulted in higher interest expense of $145,000. The aggregate of these amounts was an increase in interest expense of $170,000 related to total borrowings.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 Federal income tax considerations with regard to obligations of tax-free states and political subdivisions. \n\nThe majority of the Corporation's fixed-rate loans have a maturity date longer than five years. The primary reason for the longevity of the portfolio is the high percentage of real estate loans, which typically have maturities of 15 or 20 years. Out of all the loans due after one year, $268.9 million, or 31.5%, are fixed-rate loans as of December 31, 2021. These loans will not reprice to a higher or lower interest rate unless they mature or are refinanced by the borrower. The remaining $584.0 million, or 68.5% of loans due after one year, are made up of loans that are true floating loans and loans that will reprice at a predetermined time in the amortization of the loan. True floating rate loans that would immediately reprice according to changes in the Prime rate are favorable in reducing the Corporation's total exposure to interest rate risk and fair value risk should interest rates increase. It is likely the borrowing habits of commercial borrowers will change if the Fed raises rates in the near term. More commercial customers will desire to lock into an initial fixed interest rate period to avoid future rate increases. However, if the customer perceives rates will remain low for an extended period of time, there is a greater likelihood that borrowers will opt for variable rate loans in order to get the best available pricing.\n \u00b7 levels of classified loans, \n\nSECURITIES PORTFOLIO MATURITY ANALYSIS\nNearly all of the Corporation's income is taxed at a corporate rate of 21% for Federal income tax purposes. The Corporation is also subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax; however, very limited taxable activity is conducted at the corporate level. The Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, is not subject to state income tax, but does pay Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. The Bank Shares Tax expense appears on the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Income under operating expenses.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nAs a result of a larger balance sheet in 2021, even with much lower asset yields, the Corporation's NII on a tax equivalent basis increased while the Corporation's margin decreased to 2.81% for year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.24% in 2020. Loan yields were lower in 2021 due to the 150 basis point Fed rate decline during the first quarter of 2020 as well as competitive pressure throughout 2020 and 2021. The Corporation's NII in 2021 increased over 2020, by $2,650,000, or 6.8%.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased by $128.7 million, or 19.8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. While the average balance of time deposits did decrease for the year-to-date time periods, the average balance of demand and savings accounts increased significantly and more than offset the decline in time deposits. The interest rate paid on deposits decreased as well. This resulted in a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $996,000, or 46.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020.\nThe Corporation's average balance on securities increased by $202.7 million, or 58.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020 and the tax equivalent yield on investments declined by 36 basis points. Interest income on securities increased due to the volume growth which offset the declining yield due to lower market rates. Security reinvestment in 2021 has been occurring at slightly higher rates due to the increase in U.S. Treasury rates, but reinvestment throughout the majority of 2020 was at much lower yields. The sharp growth in the investment portfolio during a period of very low rates also contributed to the decline in average security yield. This large amount of new investment was caused by the significant influx of deposits, which caused excess liquidity.\nManagement continues to evaluate the allowance for credit losses in relation to the growth or decline of the loan portfolio and its associated credit risk, and believes the provision and the allowance for credit losses are adequate to provide for future losses. For further discussion of the calculation, see the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section.\nThe Corporation recorded a $475,000 provision for loan losses in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The higher provision in 2020 was primarily caused by increasing the qualitative factors across industry lines to various degrees as a result of potential forward credit concerns related to COVID-19 and a higher specific allocation related to one commercial borrower that paid off in 2021.\n \u00b7 Operating expenses \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u00b7 interest spread versus U.S. Treasury rates on the various securities \nOut of all the Corporation's deposit types, interest-bearing demand deposits reprice the most rapidly, as these rates can be adjusted lower after a Federal Reserve rate decrease. Demand deposit interest expense decreased a total of $342,000 in 2021, with $441,000 due to lower rates, offsetting the higher balances that caused an increase of $99,000. Higher balances in savings accounts caused an increase of $16,000, while lower rates caused a decrease of $14,000, resulting in the net increase in interest expense of $2,000 on savings deposits. Time deposit balances declined throughout 2021, resulting in lower interest expense of $109,000, while lower rates caused a decline of $547,000, resulting in a net decrease of $656,000.\nENB Financial Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, are committed to remaining an independent community bank serving its market area and the greater communities surrounding Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Corporation's roots date back to the April 11, 1881 charter granted to Ephrata National Bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank's growth has been entirely organic over 140 years of existence. The Board and Management are committed to the principals and values that have served the company well over its history and the desire is to produce strong financial results that will ensure trust from the Bank's customers and favorable returns to the shareholders.\nThe results of the Corporation's operations are best explained by addressing in further detail the five major sections of the income statement, which are as follows:\nOther income for 2021 was $17,881,000, an increase of $2,521,000, or 16.4%, compared to the $15,360,000 earned in 2020. The following table details the categories that comprise other income.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 changes in the value of underlying collateral. \nNet loans outstanding increased $97.0 million, or 12.0%, from $811.0 million at December 31, 2020, to $908.0 million at December 31, 2021. Most major loan categories showed an increase in balances over the prior year but the majority of loan growth came from the commercial and consumer real estate categories with a decline in the commercial and industrial category as PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021.\nIn 2021, the Corporation's NII on an FTE basis increased by $2,650,000, a 6.8% increase over 2020. Total interest income increased $1,824,000, or 4.3%, while interest expense decreased $826,000, or 21.5%, from 2020 to 2021. The FTE interest income from the securities portfolio increased by $2,448,000, or 32.5%, while loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2%. During 2021, additional loan volume added $2,180,000 to net interest income, and lower yields primarily due to the Prime rate decreases in the first quarter of 2020, caused a $2,597,000 decrease, resulting in a net decrease of $417,000. Higher balances in the securities portfolio caused an increase of $3,983,000 in net interest income, while lower yields on securities caused a $1,535,000 decrease, resulting in a net increase of $2,448,000.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 changes in lending policies and procedures, \nENB FINANCIAL CORP\n \u00b7 trends within the loan portfolio, \nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of $2,620,000, compared to $2,285,000 for 2020. This increase in tax expense can be attributed to higher pretax earnings. The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 14.9% for 2021 and 15.7% for 2020. The Corporation's effective tax rate is lower than the 21% corporate rate as a result of tax-free assets that the Corporation holds on its balance sheet. The majority of the Corporation's tax-free assets are in the form of obligations of states and political subdivisions, referred to as municipal bonds. The Corporation also has a relatively small component of tax-free municipal loans.\n (a) Includes balances of non-accrual loans and the recognition of any related interest income. Average balances also include net deferred loan costs of $1,755,000 in 2021, $1,277,000 in 2020, and $1,753,000 in 2019. Such fees recognized through income and included in the interest amounts totaled $1,201,000 in 2021, $993,000 in 2020, and ($523,000) in 2019. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe Corporation classifies all of its debt securities as available for sale and reports the portfolio at fair market value. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $567.1 million of debt and equity securities, compared to $483.5 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $83.6 million, or 17.3%.\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\n \u00b7 portfolio weightings versus policy guidelines \n (b) Net interest spread is the arithmetic difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. \n \u00b7 structure of the instruments, including duration and average life \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Corporation's corporate bonds increased by $20.8 million, or 33.7%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Corporate bonds add diversity to the portfolio and provide strong yields for short maturities; however, by their very nature, corporate bonds carry a high level of credit risk should the entity experience financial difficulties.\nThe largest movements within the securities portfolio were shaped by market factors, such as:\nWe maintain liquid assets at adequate levels in order to meet the needs of our balance sheet. Our primary source of liquidity is core deposits and our available-for-sale investment portfolio both of which provide more than enough liquidity to fund loans to customers and any other funding needs.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nThe following discussion and analysis represents management's view of the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial schedules included in this annual report. The financial condition and results of operations presented are not indicative of future performance.\n \u00b7 credit risk of each instrument and risk-based capital considerations \n(TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nNon-interest income excluding security and mortgage gains increased by $2,524,000, or 28.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to many positive trends such as higher trust income, higher commissions on debit card interchange fees, and lower mortgage servicing asset amortization. Mortgage gains were elevated for the second year in a row at $5,526,000, compared to $5,850,000 in 2020. Additionally, gains on debt and equity securities were $321,000, or 43.8% higher in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nThe following table provides details of the Corporation's operating expenses for the last two years along with the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous year.\n \u00b7 experience of lending personnel and management oversight, \n \u00b7 Other income \n \u00b7 prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations \nThe following table shows a more detailed analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis shown with all the major elements of the Corporation's balance sheet, which consists of interest earning and non-interest earning assets and interest bearing and non-interest bearing liabilities. Additionally, the analysis provides the net interest spread and the net yield on interest earning assets. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest spread has the deficiency of not giving credit for the non-interest bearing funds and capital used to fund a portion of the total interest earning assets. For this reason, management emphasizes the net yield on interest earning assets, also referred to as the net interest margin (NIM). The NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income on an FTE basis into total average interest earning assets. The NIM is generally the benchmark used by analysts to measure how efficiently a bank generates NII.\nThe Corporation recorded net income of $14,916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $2,617,000, or 21.3% increase over the year ended December 31, 2020. The earnings per share, basic and diluted, were $2.68 in 2021, compared to $2.20 in 2020, a 21.8% increase. The increase in the Corporation's 2021 earnings was caused primarily by growth in other income and net interest income, coupled with a decline in the provision for loan losses.\n\n (d) Securities recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized holding gains and losses are included in non-interest earning assets. \nThe Corporation purchased $14.8 million of U.S. Treasuries during 2021 and held no Treasuries in 2020. U.S. Treasuries represent a safe credit at a market appropriate yield which added some diversity to the portfolio. The Corporation's U.S. government agency sector decreased by $25.3 million, or 46.6%, since December 31, 2020. Management had purchased $35.5 million of short-term discount notes at the end of 2020 to offset the Corporation's shares tax expense. These bonds were sold in the first quarter of 2021 and are responsible for the decline in this category. Management has increased the allocations of both asset-backed securities (ABS) and obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipals) since December 31, 2020, in order to better structure the portfolio to achieve higher yields while also protecting in preparation for a rates-up environment.\nAverage balances on loans increased by $52.9 million, or 6.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. Loan yields declined by 31 basis points for the year and loan interest income decreased $417,000, or 1.2% as a result of these lower yields.\n \u00b7 levels and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, and charge-offs, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u00b7 The average balance of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities \nThe Corporation's average balance on borrowed funds increased marginally in 2021. The Corporation's borrowed funds consist of FHLB advances as well as subordinated debt issued in December of 2020 which was used to support capital growth for the Corporation. The subordinated debt issuance caused average borrowings to increase year-over-year, but the Corporation also paid off $10.6 million in FHLB advances during the year. The rate paid on borrowed funds increased by 22 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020 as a result of the issuance of subordinated debt which carries a 4.00% rate, significantly higher than the rate on FHLB advances.\n\nFIXED AND FLOATING RATE LOANS DUE AFTER ONE YEAR\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's asset-backed securities (ABS) and municipal sectors have increased significantly since December 31, 2020, with ABS increasing $40.7 million, or 67.4%, and municipals increasing $53.7 million, or 27.7%. ABS securities are floating rate student loan pools which are instruments that will perform well in a rates-up environment and offset the interest rate risk of the longer fixed-rate municipal bonds. These securities provide a variable rate return materially above the overnight Federal funds rate in a safe investment with a risk rating very similar to that of U.S. Agency bonds. The asset-backed securities generally provide monthly principal and interest payments to complement the Corporation's ongoing cash flows. With liquidity and cash levels remaining high, management views the ABS sector as a safe, higher yielding option than cash, with the qualities of cash in a rates-up environment.\n \u00b7 Net interest income \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLoans\n\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nThe average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by 18.0% during 2021, driven by the growth in deposit balances. Deposit rates decreased significantly throughout 2020 and 2021 more than offsetting the slightly higher interest expense caused by much higher balances of deposits. Lower interest rates contributed to $1,002,000 of interest expense reduction while higher balances only caused $6,000 of increased expense, resulting in a total decline in interest expense of $996,000.\nThe Corporation's U.S. agency MBS and CMO sectors decreased in total by $23.0 million, or 21.7%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Management desires to maintain a portfolio of MBS and CMOs in order to assist in adding to and maintaining a stable five-year ladder of cash flows, which is important in providing stable liquidity to the balance sheet. U.S. agency MBS and CMO securities pay contractual monthly principal and interest, but are also subject to additional prepayment of principal.\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\n \u00b7 changes in the quality of loan review and Board oversight, and \n \u00b7 concentrations of credit, \nFor more details regarding how the length of the loan portfolio and its repricing affects interest rate risk, please see\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nThe Corporation's overall cost of funds, including non-interest bearing funds, remained stable through 2021 between 19 and 13 basis points. Core deposit interest rates were reduced throughout 2020 and time deposit rates have also decreased resulting in maturing time deposits repricing at lower levels or moving into core deposit products. The average balance of borrowings was slightly higher in 2021 compared to 2020, resulting in higher interest expense of $25,000. Additionally, the $20 million sub debt issuance beginning on December 30, 2020, carried a higher rate of interest than FHLB long-term advances. As a result, the total cost of borrowings increased $145,000 when comparing 2021 to 2020, resulting in a total increase in borrowings interest expense of $170,000.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nOverview\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Condition\nNII is the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense incurred on liabilities. Accordingly, two factors affect NII:\nLOAN MATURITIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTrust and investment services income increased by 19.7% from 2020 to 2021 primarily as a result of higher income on the non-deposit investment services side which increased by $281,000, or 38.6%. Service charges on deposit accounts has remained stable from the prior year and other fees have decreased by 10.7% as a result of lower fees on a third party sweep product in 2021. Commissions increased by $739,000, or 24.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, driven by higher debit card interchange commissions. Gains on debt and equity securities were higher in 2021 driven by solid gains on debt securities sold and gains recognized on the sale of equity securities and gains from the market value increases on equity securities. Mortgage gains were very strong in both years but were higher in 2020 due to slightly higher refinancing volume and better margins on loans sold. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance increased marginally year-over-year and other miscellaneous income was significantly higher due to improvements in net mortgage servicing income and investment adjustments that positively impacted this category of income.\nThe following table shows the weighted-average life and yield on the Corporation's debt securities by maturity intervals as of December 31, 2021, based on amortized cost. All of the Corporation's securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value; however, for purposes of this schedule they are shown at amortized cost. Securities are assigned to categories based on stated contractual maturity except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on anticipated payment periods.\nStrategic Overview\nAs of December 31, 2021, the remainder of the residential real estate loans consisted of $11.2 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $75.7 million of variable rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). This compares to $10.7 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $71.3 million of HELOCs as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, combined, these two types of home equity loans increased from $82.0 million to $86.9 million, an increase of 6.0%.\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) provides for losses inherent in the loan portfolio as determined by a quarterly analysis and calculation of various factors related to the loan portfolio. The amount of the provision reflects the adjustment management determines necessary to ensure the ACL is adequate to cover any losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Corporation gives special attention to the level of underperforming loans when calculating the necessary provision for loan losses. The analysis of the credit loss allowance takes into consideration, among other things, the following factors:\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nBalance Sheet Overview and Liquidity\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by a number of items resulting in strong financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and business responses thereto continues to impact customer behavior and balance sheet growth, but as of the date of this report there has not been significant negative impacts on earnings or credit. Customers have adapted to changes in behavior and the Corporation continues to seek ways to manage the structure of the balance sheet to achieve positive financial results now and in future time periods.\n \u00b7 external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements, \nThe financial services industry uses two primary performance measurements to gauge performance: return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE). ROA measures how efficiently a bank generates income based on the amount of assets or size of a company. ROE measures the efficiency of a company in generating income based on the amount of equity or capital utilized.\n \u00b7 Income taxes \nOTHER INCOME\n\n \u00b7 The rates charged on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities \nAt December 31, 2021, we had $491.4 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $99.0 million in firm loan commitments, $379.6 million in unused lines of credit, and open letters of credit of $12.8 million. Certificates of deposit due within one year totaled $63.6 million, or 55.8% of certificates of deposit. We believe, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us upon maturity and we have ample liquidity outside of these funds. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nThe other area of commercial lending is non-real estate secured commercial lending, referred to as commercial and industrial lending. Commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate loans decreased from $129.2 million at December 31, 2020, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2021, a 15.4% decrease, primarily attributable to the forgiveness of PPP loans throughout 2021. Outside of PPP loans, the commercial and industrial category generally includes unsecured lines of credit, truck, equipment, and receivable and inventory loans, in addition to tax-free loans to municipalities. PPP loan balances declined by $36.6 million during 2021, and ended the year with a balance of only $11.3 million. Management expects that virtually all of the remaining balance will be forgiven during 2022.\nA portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings. At December 31, 2021, cash and equivalents amounted to $158.4 million, an increase of $63.5 million, or 66.9%, from balances at December 31, 2020. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the sales, calls, and maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2021, we had borrowings outstanding from the FHLB of $44.2 million and subordinated debt of $19.7 million.\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's net interest income (NII) increased by $2,323,000, or 6.1%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in NII primarily resulted from an increase in interest on securities available for sale of $2,097,000, or 31.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. In addition, interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased by $826,000, or 21.5%, in 2021 compared to the prior year. The low interest rate environment has caused a rapid decline in asset yield, but also a decline in the cost of funds, which has resulted in these much lower levels of interest expense.\nThe consumer real estate category represents the largest group of loans for the Corporation. The consumer residential real estate category of total loans increased from $345.6 million on December 31, 2020, to $403.9 million on December 31, 2021, a 16.9% increase. This category includes closed-end fixed rate or adjustable rate residential real estate loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, including first and junior liens, and floating rate home equity loans. The first lien 1-4 family mortgages increased by $53.5 million, or 20.3%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The vast majority of the first lien 1-4 family closed end loans consist of single family personal first lien residential mortgages and home equity loans, with the remainder consisting of 1-4 family residential non-owner-occupied mortgages. During 2021, mortgage production increased 18.1% over the prior year. The increase in overall production was due to a large increase in portfolio production, which was up 73% over last year, while secondary market production decreased by 23%. The percentage of mortgage originations that went into the Corporation's held for investment mortgage portfolio increased to 63% compared to 55% in 2020. The interest rate environment throughout the year remained relatively stable and created a nice balance within our mix; 36% of volume in 2021 was purchase, 31% was residential construction lending, and 33% was refinance activity. The volume of mortgage production in 2021 led to a 20.7% increase in growth of the held for investment residential loan portfolio and a 22.8% increase in the servicing on behalf of others portfolio, with mortgage servicing rights growing to over $1.7 million.\nThe Corporation recorded a provision of $475,000 in 2021, compared to $2,950,000 in 2020. The provision expense was elevated in 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19 and the deteriorating economic conditions that were expected to impact credit risk moving forward. The Corporation also provided $1.1 million in a specific allocation to one commercial borrower in 2020. This loan paid off during 2021 resulting in a reversal of that specific allocation and an overall reduction in provision expense. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.40%, compared to 1.50% at December 31, 2020.\n \u00b7 Provision for loan losses \nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nObligations of states and political subdivisions, or municipal bonds, consist of both tax-free and taxable securities that generally provide the highest yield in the securities portfolio. They also carry the longest duration on average of any instrument in the securities portfolio. These instruments also experience significant fair market value gains and losses when interest rates decrease and increase. Municipal bonds represented 44.3% of the debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021, compared to 40.7% as of December 31, 2020.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\n\nThe following discussion analyzes each of these five components.\nENB FINANCIAL CORP\nAs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities was $195.2 million and $232.5 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $245.5 million and $269.9 million for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively primarily representing increases in our core deposits through the year.\nThe following table provides an analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income by distinguishing what changes were a result of average balance increases or decreases and what changes were a result of interest rate increases or decreases.\n (c) Net yield, also referred to as net interest margin, is computed by dividing net interest income (FTE) by total interest

report:\n\nOverview\n- Net income was $14.9 million in 2021, up 21.3% from 2020, primarily due to growth in other income and net interest income. \n- Earnings per share was $2.68 in 2021, up 21.8% from $2.20 in 2020.\n\nNet Interest Income \n- Net interest income increased by $2.3 million or 6.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher interest income on securities and lower interest expense on deposits/borrowings.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\n- Provision expense decreased from $3.0 million in 2020 to $0.5 million in 2021, as 2020 had elevated provisioning due to COVID-19 concerns. \n\nOther Income  \n- Other income increased by 16.4% to $17.9 million in 2021, largely due to higher trust income, debit card fees, and mortgage gains.\n\nOperating Expenses\n- Operating expenses increased 12.1% in 2021 to $40.4 million, mainly attributable to higher salaries/benefits and technology costs.  \n\nLoan Portfolio\n- Total loans increased by 12.0% in 2021 with growth across most major categories. The consumer real estate portfolio grew 16.9%. \n\nInvestment Securities \n- The securities portfolio grew 17.3% in 2021 to $567.1 million. Significant increases in asset-backed securities and municipal bonds.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Solid liquidity position supported by core deposits, available-for-sale securities, and access to borrowings."}
