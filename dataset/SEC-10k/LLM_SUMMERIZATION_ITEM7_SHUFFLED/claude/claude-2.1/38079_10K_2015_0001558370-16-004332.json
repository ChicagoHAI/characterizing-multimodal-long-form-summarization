The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from expectations include changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas properties onshore in the United States. Our properties are primarily focused in three core geographic areas:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEast Texas targeting the Cotton Valley Sand, and Haynesville Shale formations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSouth Texas, targeting the Eagle Ford Shale formation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNorth Texas, targeting the Granite Wash formation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held interests in approximately 272,100 gross (217,000 net) acres in East Texas, 82,900 gross (53,400 net) acres in South Texas and 33,900 gross (25,300 net) acres in North Texas. As of December 31, 2015, we were the operator on 90%, 99% and 99% of our net acreage positions in East Texas, South Texas and North Texas, respectively.\nOur 2016 capital expenditures are forecasted to total approximately $18 million. As a result, we expect production growth from our 2016 capital program will not offset production declines, which will result in material decreases to our production and related cash flows. Consistent with our historical practice, we periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, commodity prices and drilling results.\nOur MD&A includes the following sections;\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChapter 11 Filings - a description of our recent events and our Chapter 11 filings\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Combination - a description of the 2014 combination with Forest Oil Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSources of Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrincipal Components of Cost Structure\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSignificant Transactions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nResults of Operations - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the annual periods presented in our financial statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commercial commitments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChapter 11 Filings\nOn July 15, 2015, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including Giant Gas Gathering LLC, Sabine Bear Paw Basin LLC, Sabine East Texas Basin LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent Gathering LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent LLC, Sabine Oil & Gas Finance Corp., Sabine South Texas Gathering LLC, Sabine South Texas LLC and Sabine Williston Basin LLC (collectively, the Filing Subsidiaries\u201d and, together with us, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions (the Bankruptcy Petitions\u201d) for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Debtors Chapter 11 cases (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) are being jointly administered under the case styled In re Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, et al, Case No. 15-11835. The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nBy certain first day\u201d motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, we obtained Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things and subject to the terms of the orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, pay certain employee wages, health benefits and certain other employee obligations, pay certain lienholders and forward funds to third parties, including royalty holders and other partners.\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process. For example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, and other third parties and our ability to retain employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For a description of these and other risks, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares and shareholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nIn particular, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may assert claims against the applicable debtor's estate for such damages. The assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease generally requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors in this Annual Report, including where applicable a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors, is qualified by any overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease and the Debtors expressly preserve all of their rights with respect thereto.\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above constitutes an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. This debt includes unsecured and under secured obligations which are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed as claims by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and could be material. For additional description of the defaults present under our debt obligations, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nWe are making adequate protection payments to the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to the non-default rate of interest, fees and costs due and payable on a monthly basis under the New Revolving Credit Facility, in accordance with the cash collateral order filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, cash generated by the Company deemed to be proceeds of the oil and gas properties that represent prepetition collateral is\ndeposited into a segregated account, which is reflected as Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, and is used solely to pay for the operations of the prepetition collateral properties.\nOn October 21, 2015 the Debtors filed a motion to set a bar date to assist with the claims reconciliation process. On January 26, 2016, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court a joint plan of reorganization (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests in the Debtors and a disclosure statement (the Disclosure Statement\u201d) related thereto. The Plan of Reorganization, if implemented as proposed by the Debtors, would significantly reduce our outstanding long-term debt and annual interest payments. The Disclosure Statement has not yet been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Although the Debtors currently have the exclusive right to file a plan and solicit the appropriate votes thereon, such rights expire on February 10, 2016 and April 11, 2016, respectively. Accordingly, the Debtors have filed a motion to further extend their exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of the Plan of Reorganization, or any other plan, through June 9, 2016 and August 9, 2016, respectively. A hearing on that motion will be held before the US Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2016 and April 11, 2016. There can be no assurances regarding our ability to successfully develop, confirm or consummate the Plan of Reorganization, an alternative plan or reorganization or another alternative restructuring transactions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, which satisfies the conditions of the Bankruptcy Code and is authorized by the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe Combination\nOn December 16, 2014, the Legacy Sabine Investors contributed the equity interests in Sabine O&G to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, which was then known as Forest Oil Corporation. In exchange for this contribution, the Legacy Sabine Investors received shares of Sabine common stock and Sabine Series A preferred stock, collectively representing approximately a 73.5% economic interest in Sabine and 40% of the total voting power in Sabine. Immediately following the contribution, Sabine O&G and related holding companies merged into Forest, with Forest surviving the mergers. Holders of Sabine common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Combination continued to hold their Sabine common stock following the closing, which immediately following the closing represented approximately a 26.5% economic interest in Sabine and 60% of the total voting power in Sabine. On December 19, 2014, Forest Oil Corporation changed its name to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation. In connection with the completion of the Combination, the executive management team of Sabine O&G was appointed as the executive management team of Sabine, and the members of the former executive management team of Forest resigned or were removed from their positions.\nSabine O&G is considered the predecessor of Sabine or acquirer of Forest, and, accordingly, the historical financial statements and results of operations of Sabine for periods prior to the completion of the Combination are those of Sabine O&G, as the predecessor, and the historical financial statements and results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2014 include the historical financial statements of Sabine O&G, with the combined operating results of Forest consolidated therein only from the closing date of December 16, 2014 and thereafter. Accordingly, our results of operations discussed in this section may not be indicative of our results of operation following the Combination. The underlying Forest assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us were based on their respective fair market values. No goodwill resulted from the Combination as the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed approximated purchase price.\nPrior to the Combination, Sabine O&G was a privately-held company and Forest's common stock was listed on the NYSE. Currently, the Company's common stock trades on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol SOGC\u201d.\nSource of Revenues\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are produced from our interests in properties located onshore in the United States. Oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. Oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly in the second half of 2014 and have remained low through the first quarter of 2016. If commodity prices remain at current levels, we expect significantly lower revenues and operating cash flows compared to historical results.\nIn the past we have used derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of oil and natural gas production, to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce exposure to downward price fluctuations. However, as a result of certain events of default under our derivative contracts, all our derivative instruments have been\nterminated and we no longer have any derivative contracts in place. See Commodity Hedging Activities\u201d below for more information regarding our economic hedge positions.\nPrincipal Components of Cost Structure\nTable 163: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLease operating, marketing, gathering, transportation and other. These are costs incurred to produce oil and natural gas and deliver the volumes to the market, together with the costs incurred to maintain producing properties, such as maintenance and repairs. These costs, which have both a fixed and variable component, are primarily a function of volume of oil and natural gas produced from currently producing wells and incrementally from new production from drilling and completion activities. Lease operating expenses include workover expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas primarily based on the wellhead value of production. The applicable rates vary across the areas in which we operate. As the proportion of production changes from area to area, production tax rates will vary depending on the quantities produced from each area and the applicable production tax rates then in effect. Ad valorem taxes are typically computed on the basis of a property valuation as determined by certain state and local taxing authorities and will vary annually based on commodity price fluctuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGeneral and administrative. This cost includes all overhead associated with our business activities, including payroll and benefits for corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, audit, tax, legal and other professional and consulting fees, insurance and other costs necessary in the management of our production and development operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a full cost method of accounting company, we capitalize general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to our oil and natural gas activities. We capitalized $9.2 million, $10.1 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization ( DD&A\u201d). This includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisition, exploration, development and related efforts and deplete these costs using the units-of-production method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImpairments. We evaluate the impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties on a full cost basis. Property impairment charges result from application of the ceiling test under the full cost accounting rules, which we are required to calculate on a quarterly basis. The ceiling test requires that a non-cash impairment charge be taken to reduce the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if the carrying value exceeds a defined cost-center ceiling. Because current commodity prices, and related calculations of the discounted present value of reserves, are significant factors in the full cost ceiling test, impairment charges may result from declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $1.6 billion, $247.7 million and no impairment, respectively, of non-cash impairment charges as a result of the full cost ceiling limitation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe could have a future reduction in asset carrying value for oil and natural gas properties if the average of the unweighted first day of the month oil and natural gas prices for the prior twelve month period declines. For example, as of December 31, 2015, the unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for oil and natural gas were $50.28 per Bbl and $2.58 per MMbtu, respectively, compared to $46.26 per Bbl and $2.39 per MMbtu for oil and natural gas, respectively, in March 2016. Holding all other factors constant, if commodity prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were decreased by $4.02 per Bbl for crude oil and $0.19 per Mcf for natural gas, thereby approximating the pricing environment existing in March 2016, our estimated discounted future cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2015 would decrease by approximately $69 million, or 14%. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties and otherwise if impairment has occurred. In addition, we analyze our unevaluated leasehold and transfer to evaluated properties leasehold that can be associated with proved reserves, leasehold that expired in the quarter or leasehold that is\nnot a part of our development strategy and will be abandoned. As of December 31, 2015 the Company has no unevaluated properties excluded from the full cost pool.\nWe evaluate gas gathering and processing equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded no impairment, $1.7 million and no impairment, respectively, based on expected present value and estimated future cash flows using current volume throughput and pricing assumptions. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 of each year and more frequently if changes in circumstances warrant. Due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014, a December 31, 2014 impairment test was also performed and resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. No goodwill remains as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of transaction costs related to the Combination.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest. During the periods presented, we have historically financed a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. As a result, we incurred interest expense that was affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We also incurred interest expense on our 2017 Notes, and, for the period following the completion of the Combination on December 16, 2014, the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. As of March 21, 2016, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, which will continue to expose us to interest rates. As of March 21, 2016, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Additionally, we capitalized $3.3 million, $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReorganization Expense. The Company uses this category to reflect the net revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are the result of the reorganization and restructuring of the business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProfessional fees included in Reorganization items, net represent professional fees for post-petition expenses. Deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts are related to the New Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes and are included in Reorganization items, net as we believe these debt instruments may be impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process. Terminated contracts are primarily related to the Company's rig and servicing contracts rejected on August 10, 2015 by the Court, effective July 15, 2015. For additional information, please see Note 14 to our financial statements included herein. The terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related to rejection of approved contracts that were not previously included in the balance sheet as the liability was contingent or an executory contract previously reported as commitments and contingencies. Expenses for terminated contracts were based on pre-petition general unsecured claims for damages caused by the Company's breach of contract.\nDuring the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company will operate their businesses as \"debtors-in-possession\" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 852, Reorganizations, applies to entities that have filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The guidance requires that transactions and events directly associated with the reorganization be distinguished from the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, the guidance provides for changes in the accounting and presentation of liabilities, as well as expenses and income directly associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, we were a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax liabilities and/or benefits of Sabine O&G being passed through to its member. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 prior to the Combination as our equity holders were responsible for income tax on our profits. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. Our book and tax basis in assets and liabilities differed at the time of our change in tax status due primarily to different cost recovery periods utilized for book and tax purposes for our oil and natural gas properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year December 31, 2014, we recorded total income tax expense of $35 million. The significant differences between our blended federal and state statutory income tax rate of 36% were primarily due to earnings prior to the corporate merger that are not subject to corporate income tax, recording the initial book and tax basis differences associated with the change in tax status, and impairment of non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance. For the year December 31, 2015, we recorded total income tax expense of $3.1 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance which offsets the additional deferred tax assets recorded through purchase accounting for Forest. The significant differences between our blended and state statutory income tax rate of 35.5% were primarily due to the change in the Company's full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset balance, changes in estimate for the 2014 period and state income taxes.\nSignificant Transactions\nOther than the Combination, which is described under The Combination\u201d above, the following table presents a summary of our significant property acquisitions from 2013 through 2015:\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimary locations of acquired properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTransaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPurchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNorth Texas - Granite Wash (TX)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJune 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNorth Texas - Granite Wash (TX)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarch 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSouth Texas - Eagleford Shale (TX)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur acquisitions were financed with a combination of funding from equity contributions from sponsors, borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and cash flow from operations. Because of our substantial recent acquisition activity, the discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods discussed below may not necessarily be comparable with or applicable to future results of operations. Our historical results include the results from recent acquisitions beginning on the closing dates indicated in the table above.\nIn 2015 we sold our working interest in various oil and gas properties in our non-core areas at auction for approximately $6.4 million. In December 2013, we sold our working interest in approximately 27,000 net acres in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma areas (including the Cleveland Sands assets acquired in 2012) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $169 million.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table sets forth selected operating

Lease operating expenses increased from $51.3 million in 2014 to $88.9 million in 2015, an increase of 73%. The increase in lease operating expense of $37.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of the Combination. Lease operating expenses increased from $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.87 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $0.19 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to higher cost legacy Forest production.

Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $23.6 million in 2014 to $33.9 million in 2015, an increase of 44%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.33 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $10.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our development activities throughout 2014 and 2015, coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities and the Combination.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $18.2 million in 2014 to $17.6 million in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.17 per Mcfe in 2015. The decrease of $0.07 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to lower pricing of 48% per Bbl for oil and 41% per Mcf for natural gas, coupled with processing high cost gas exemptions in 2015, partially offset by increased production associated with the Combination. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 5% and 4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $30.4 million in 2014 to $42.7 million in 2015, an increase of $12.3 million, or 41%, primarily as a result of higher overhead associated with the Combination. General and administrative expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.42 per Mcfe in 2015.\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization. DD&A decreased from $189.5 million in 2014 to $182.4 million in 2015, a decrease of $7.1 million. DD&A decreased from $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014 to $1.79 per Mcfe in 2015, or a decrease of 4%. The decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by a lower amortization base due to recent ceiling test impairments resulting from declines in the prior 12 month pricing and lower PV-10 estimates compared to net book value, coupled with increased total reserves from the Combination.\nImpairments. In 2015, as a result of a decrease in commodity pricing, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $1.6 billion and impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014 the Company tested goodwill for impairment. At December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2015 consist primarily of $19.8 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.9 million of charges related to marketing contract volume commitments. Other operating expenses in 2014 consist primarily of $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on a sale of other assets of $1.5 million.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $180.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $64.7 million, or 56%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility, the assumption of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes in connection with the consummation of the Combination on December 16, 2014 and increased amortization of associated debt discounts. No interest expense has been recognized subsequent to the petition date on the Term Loan, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes or the 2020 Notes.\nGain on derivative instruments. Gains from the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as cash settlements on commodity derivatives are recognized in our results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $33.9 million and $121.7 million, respectively. The Company's Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under Sabine's existing derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Additionally, certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition.\nReorganization Items, net. Professional fees included in Reorganization Items, net represent professional fees incurred for post-petition expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred by the Company and are presented as reorganization items. Terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related primarily to rig and servicing contracts, certain office leases and other executory contracts, and were not previously included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the liability was contingent in nature or other executory contracts included in commitments and contingencies.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred financing costs & unamortized discounts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n378,705 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminated contracts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n33,197 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(157) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n458,838 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35.0 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance associated with the Combination. We recorded an additional deferred tax expense of $3.1 million in December 2015 for adjustments related to the net deferred tax expense estimate recorded in December 2014.\nYear Ended December 31,

Lease operating expenses increased from $44.6 million in 2013 to $51.3 million in 2014, an increase of 15%. The increase in lease operating expense of $6.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of development activities in South Texas partially offset by the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. Lease operating expenses decreased from $0.70 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area with offsetting increases in South Texas and East Texas as a result of increasing development activities.

Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $17.6 million in 2013 to $23.6 million in 2014 an increase of 34%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expense increased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014. The increase of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our South Texas development activities as well as gas volumes associated with our Haynesville development activities in East Texas, which were subject to higher fees due to lack of pipeline infrastructure, partially offset by decreases in the average rate per Mcfe due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities in that area.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from $17.8 million in 2013 to $18.2 million in 2014, an increase of 2%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in North Texas production due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. This decrease in the rate per Mcfe is partially offset by increases in production tax expenses primarily due to increased production in the South Texas region which is incurring higher production taxes on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 4% and 5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased from $27.5 million in 2013 to $30.4 million in 2014, an increase of $2.9 million, or 11%, as a result of higher overhead associated with our growing\nbusiness. General and administrative expenses decreased on a per unit basis from $0.43 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 production without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses.\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A). DD&A increased from $137.1 million in 2013 to $189.5 million in 2014, an increase of $52.4 million. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased from $2.15 per Mcfe in 2013 to $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014, or an increase of 18%. The increase in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by reductions to proved reserves due to the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties in North Texas during the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as an increase in the amortization base as a result of development activities without a proportionate increase in reserve volumes.\nImpairments. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment, a December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2013, there were impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. There were no impairments related to oil and natural gas properties recognized in 2013 as a result of favorable unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $3.67 per MMbtu as compared to $2.76 per MMbtu for the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as favorable performance from our 2013 development activities.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2014 relate primarily to $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on sale of other assets of $1.5 million, as compared to $0.9 million of other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $99.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $16.1 million, or 16%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility and $5.8 million of interest expense on the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. Additionally, capitalized interest has decreased due to reclassification of unproved oil and natural gas properties in 2014 into the full cost pool as a result of development activities or impairments due to lease expirations and abandonments. We capitalized $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGain on derivative instruments. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as cash settlements on commodity derivatives are recognized in our results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $121.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically been equity contributions, borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, net cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from the Term Loan Facility. Our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Since the Chapter 11 filings, our principal sources of liquidity have been limited to cash flow from operations and cash on hand. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with the preparation and administration of\nthe Chapter 11 Cases. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs for the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015 we have not entered into additional derivative contracts. Additionally, the filing of our Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under our derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition. The terminations resulted in settlements of approximately $24.3 million for which such proceeds were used to reduce the amount of borrowing outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Other terminations resulted in approximately $70.8 million of direct offsets against the New Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the Company no longer has any derivatives beyond July 2015.\nAlthough we believe our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet the operating costs of our existing business, there are no assurances that our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations or to allow us to continue as a going concern until a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or another alternative restructuring transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated. Our long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of our capital resources and our ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11 plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court. If our future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a going concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement further cost reductions, seek other financing alternatives or seek the sale of some or all of our assets. The Company has temporarily deferred additional development activities. If we (i) continue to limit, defer or eliminate future capital expenditure plans, (ii) are unsuccessful in developing reserves and adding production through our capital program or (iii) implement cost-cutting efforts that are too overreaching, the value of our oil and natural gas properties and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with funding our liquidity and the Combination, we have incurred substantial additional debt. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, and, as of December 31, 2015, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, our filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under these debt instruments. For a description of our outstanding debt instruments, please see -Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.\u201d The stay under the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to letters of credit and third parties may continue do draw on their letters of credit.\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and fund our capital expenditures has been negatively impacted by significant decreases in the market price for oil, NGLs and natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2014 with continued weakness throughout 2015. The decrease in the market price for our production directly reduces our operating cash flow. While we historically used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, none of our production is hedged and we may be unable to effectively hedge our production for future periods. In addition, the decrease in the market price for our production indirectly impacts our other sources of potential liquidity.\nOn February 25, 2015, we borrowed $356 million under our New Revolving Credit Facility which represented the remaining undrawn amount under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Our borrowing base under our New Revolving Credit Facility was subject to its semi-annual redetermination on April 27, 2015 and was decreased to $750 million. The decrease in our borrowing base as a result of the redetermination resulted in a deficiency of approximately $250 million which required repayment in six monthly installments in an amount of $41.54 million, beginning May 27, 2015. None of such payments has been made or will be made and pursuant to the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility are currently stayed from taking any action against us as a result of these non-payments. Our cash balance at March 21, 2016 was approximately $173.0 million.\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and would be material. For additional description of the defaults present under our debt obligations, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital balance fluctuates as a result of timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments, the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners as well as changes in revenue receivables as a result of price and volume fluctuations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an increase in working capital of $2.2 billion. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the reclassification of our debt from Current maturities of long-term debt\u201d to Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015. In addition, fluctuations are due to the timing and amount of the receivable collections, development activities, payments made by us to vendors, and the timing and amount of advances from our joint operations. For more information on the classification of debt, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are primarily affected by the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as commodity prices, net of effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was $134.4 million, $209.2 million and $217.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of decrease in prices, higher interest payments and costs incurred for the Combination and costs incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases. A substantial portion of 2015 cash flow (approximately $76 million) was also derived from changes in working capital during the year. The decrease in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of the excess in cash outflows for settlements of derivatives, higher interest payments, costs incurred for the Combination and the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma, offset by greater cash proceeds due to 18% higher volumes and 11% higher realized prices.\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas production. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position, see Part II,", "item_7_truncated": "By certain first day\u201d motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, we obtained Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things and subject to the terms of the orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, pay certain employee wages, health benefits and certain other employee obligations, pay certain lienholders and forward funds to third parties, including royalty holders and other partners.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProfessional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,117 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred financing costs & unamortized discounts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n378,705 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminated contracts\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n33,197 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(157) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Reorganization items, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n458,838 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are produced from our interests in properties located onshore in the United States.

the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may assert claims against the applicable debtor's estate for such damages. The assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease generally requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors in this Annual Report, including where applicable a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors, is qualified by any overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease and the Debtors expressly preserve all of their rights with respect thereto.\nOn July 15, 2015, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including Giant Gas Gathering LLC, Sabine Bear Paw Basin LLC, Sabine East Texas Basin LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent Gathering LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent LLC, Sabine Oil & Gas Finance Corp., Sabine South Texas Gathering LLC, Sabine South Texas LLC and Sabine Williston Basin LLC (collectively, the Filing Subsidiaries\u201d and, together with us, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions (the Bankruptcy Petitions\u201d) for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Debtors Chapter 11 cases (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) are being jointly administered under the case styled In re Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, et al, Case No. 15-11835. The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn connection with funding our liquidity and the Combination, we have incurred substantial additional debt. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, and, as of December 31, 2015, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, our filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under these debt instruments. For a description of our outstanding debt instruments, please see -Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.\u201d The stay under the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to letters of credit and third parties may continue do draw on their letters of credit.\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in Bcfe)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSouth Texas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.96 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.65 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEast Texas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72.76 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44.39 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNorth Texas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.23 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.92 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n101.95 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74.96 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nterminated and we no longer have any derivative contracts in place.

Interest expense increased from $99.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $16.1 million, or 16%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility and $5.8 million of interest expense on the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. Additionally, capitalized interest has decreased due to reclassification of unproved oil and natural gas properties in 2014 into the full cost pool as a result of development activities or impairments due to lease expirations and abandonments. We capitalized $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrior to the Combination, Sabine O&G was a privately-held company and Forest's common stock was listed on the NYSE. Currently, the Company's common stock trades on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol SOGC\u201d.\n (2) Interest at contractual interest rates would have been $193.5 million for 2015. As of the petition date, interest is no longer being accrued on the Term Loan Facility, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. \n \u00b7 Production and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas primarily based on the wellhead value of production. The applicable rates vary across the areas in which we operate. As the proportion of production changes from area to area, production tax rates will vary depending on the quantities produced from each area and the applicable production tax rates then in effect. Ad valorem taxes are typically computed on the basis of a property valuation as determined by certain state and local taxing authorities and will vary annually based on commodity price fluctuations.

This includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisition, exploration, development and related efforts and deplete these costs using the units-of-production method. \n \u00b7 The Combination - a description of the 2014 combination with Forest Oil Corporation \nOverview\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from $17.8 million in 2013 to $18.2 million in 2014, an increase of 2%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in North Texas production due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. This decrease in the rate per Mcfe is partially offset by increases in production tax expenses primarily due to increased production in the South Texas region which is incurring higher production taxes on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 4% and 5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGain on derivative instruments. Gains from the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as cash settlements on commodity derivatives are recognized in our results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $33.9 million and $121.7 million, respectively. The Company's Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under Sabine's existing derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Additionally, certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition.\nReorganization Items, net. Professional fees included in Reorganization Items, net represent professional fees incurred for post-petition expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred by the Company and are presented as reorganization items. Terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related primarily to rig and servicing contracts, certain office leases and other executory contracts, and were not previously included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the liability was contingent in nature or other executory contracts included in commitments and contingencies.\nOur working capital balance fluctuates as a result of timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments, the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners as well as changes in revenue receivables as a result of price and volume fluctuations.\n \u00b7 Chapter 11 Filings - a description of our recent events and our Chapter 11 filings \nOur MD&A includes the following sections;\n \nSignificant Transactions\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above constitutes an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. This debt includes unsecured and under secured obligations which are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed as claims by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and could be material. For additional description of the defaults present under our debt obligations, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and would be material. For additional description of the defaults present under our debt obligations, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nLease operating expenses. Lease operating expenses increased from $44.6 million in 2013 to $51.3 million in 2014, an increase of 15%. The increase in lease operating expense of $6.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of development activities in South Texas partially offset by the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. Lease operating expenses decreased from $0.70 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area with offsetting increases in South Texas and East Texas as a result of increasing development activities. The following table displays the lease operating expense by area for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and fund our capital expenditures has been negatively impacted by significant decreases in the market price for oil, NGLs and natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2014 with continued weakness throughout 2015. The decrease in the market price for our production directly reduces our operating cash flow. While we historically used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, none of our production is hedged and we may be unable to effectively hedge our production for future periods. In addition, the decrease in the market price for our production indirectly impacts our other sources of potential liquidity.\n\nOur 2016 capital expenditures are forecasted to total approximately $18 million. As a result, we expect production growth from our 2016 capital program will not offset production declines, which will result in material decreases to our production and related cash flows. Consistent with our historical practice, we periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, commodity prices and drilling results.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015 we have not entered into additional derivative contracts. Additionally, the filing of our Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under our derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition. The terminations resulted in settlements of approximately $24.3 million for which such proceeds were used to reduce the amount of borrowing outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Other terminations resulted in approximately $70.8 million of direct offsets against the New Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the Company no longer has any derivatives beyond July 2015.\nOther than the Combination, which is described under The Combination\u201d above, the following table presents a summary of our significant property acquisitions from 2013 through 2015:\n\nThe following table sets forth additional information concerning our production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013:\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nthe Chapter 11 Cases. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs for the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\n \u00b7 Lease operating, marketing, gathering, transportation and other. These are costs incurred to produce oil and natural gas and deliver the volumes to the market, together with the costs incurred to maintain producing properties, such as maintenance and repairs. These costs, which have both a fixed and variable component, are primarily a function of volume of oil and natural gas produced from currently producing wells and incrementally from new production from drilling and completion activities. Lease operating expenses include workover expenses. \nFor the year December 31, 2014, we recorded total income tax expense of $35 million. The significant differences between our blended federal and state statutory income tax rate of 36% were primarily due to earnings prior to the corporate merger that are not subject to corporate income tax, recording the initial book and tax basis differences associated with the change in tax status, and impairment of non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance. For the year December 31, 2015, we recorded total income tax expense of $3.1 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance which offsets the additional deferred tax assets recorded through purchase accounting for Forest. The significant differences between our blended and state statutory income tax rate of 35.5% were primarily due to the change in the Company's full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset balance, changes in estimate for the 2014 period and state income taxes.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 of each year and more frequently if changes in circumstances warrant. Due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014, a December 31, 2014 impairment test was also performed and resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. No goodwill remains as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n (1) Oil and NGL production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate combined production and per Mcfe amounts. \n \u00b7 Significant Transactions \nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically been equity contributions, borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, net cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from the Term Loan Facility. Our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Since the Chapter 11 filings, our principal sources of liquidity have been limited to cash flow from operations and cash on hand. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with the preparation and administration of\nWe could have a future reduction in asset carrying value for oil and natural gas properties if the average of the unweighted first day of the month oil and natural gas prices for the prior twelve month period declines. For example, as of December 31, 2015, the unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for oil and natural gas were $50.28 per Bbl and $2.58 per MMbtu, respectively, compared to $46.26 per Bbl and $2.39 per MMbtu for oil and natural gas, respectively, in March 2016. Holding all other factors constant, if commodity prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were decreased by $4.02 per Bbl for crude oil and $0.19 per Mcf for natural gas, thereby approximating the pricing environment existing in March 2016, our estimated discounted future cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2015 would decrease by approximately $69 million, or 14%. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties and otherwise if impairment has occurred. In addition, we analyze our unevaluated leasehold and transfer to evaluated properties leasehold that can be associated with proved reserves, leasehold that expired in the quarter or leasehold that is\n \u00b7 Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of transaction costs related to the Combination. \nMarketing, gathering, transportation and other. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $23.6 million in 2014 to $33.9 million in 2015, an increase of 44%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.33 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $10.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our development activities throughout 2014 and 2015, coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities and the Combination.\n\nLease operating. Lease operating expenses increased from $51.3 million in 2014 to $88.9 million in 2015, an increase of 73%. The increase in lease operating expense of $37.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of the Combination. Lease operating expenses increased from $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.87 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $0.19 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to higher cost legacy Forest production. The following table displays the lease operating expense by area for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from expectations include changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nImpairments. In 2015, as a result of a decrease in commodity pricing, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $1.6 billion and impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014 the Company tested goodwill for impairment. At December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur acquisitions were financed with a combination of funding from equity contributions from sponsors, borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and cash flow from operations. Because of our substantial recent acquisition activity, the discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods discussed below may not necessarily be comparable with or applicable to future results of operations. Our historical results include the results from recent acquisitions beginning on the closing dates indicated in the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held interests in approximately 272,100 gross (217,000 net) acres in East Texas, 82,900 gross (53,400 net) acres in South Texas and 33,900 gross (25,300 net) acres in North Texas. As of December 31, 2015, we were the operator on 90%, 99% and 99% of our net acreage positions in East Texas, South Texas and North Texas, respectively.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $180.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $64.7 million, or 56%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility, the assumption of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes in connection with the consummation of the Combination on December 16, 2014 and increased amortization of associated debt discounts. No interest expense has been recognized subsequent to the petition date on the Term Loan, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes or the 2020 Notes.\n \u00b7 Impairments. We evaluate the impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties on a full cost basis. Property impairment charges result from application of the ceiling test under the full cost accounting rules, which we are required to calculate on a quarterly basis. The ceiling test requires that a non-cash impairment charge be taken to reduce the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if the carrying value exceeds a defined cost-center ceiling. Because current commodity prices, and related calculations of the discounted present value of reserves, are significant factors in the full cost ceiling test, impairment charges may result from declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $1.6 billion, $247.7 million and no impairment, respectively, of non-cash impairment charges as a result of the full cost ceiling limitation. \nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35.0 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance associated with the Combination. We recorded an additional deferred tax expense of $3.1 million in December 2015 for adjustments related to the net deferred tax expense estimate recorded in December 2014.\n (2) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of cash settlements on commodity derivative transactions. The Company's calculation of such effects includes gains or losses on cash settlements for commodity derivative transactions. \nbusiness. General and administrative expenses decreased on a per unit basis from $0.43 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 production without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses.\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas properties onshore in the United States. Our properties are primarily focused in three core geographic areas:\n \u00b7 General and administrative. This cost includes all overhead associated with our business activities, including payroll and benefits for corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, audit, tax, legal and other professional and consulting fees, insurance and other costs necessary in the management of our production and development operations. \nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process. For example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, and other third parties and our ability to retain employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For a description of these and other risks, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares and shareholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nThe following table sets forth additional information concerning our production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\n* Not meaningful or applicable\n \u00b7 South Texas, targeting the Eagle Ford Shale formation; and \nWe are making adequate protection payments to the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to the non-default rate of interest, fees and costs due and payable on a monthly basis under the New Revolving Credit Facility, in accordance with the cash collateral order filed with the Bankruptcy Court.

Revenues from production of oil and natural gas increased from $354.2 million in 2013 to $462.4 million in 2014, an increase of 31%. This increase of $108.1 million was primarily the result of an increase in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues of $48.8 million, $2.6 million and $56.7 million, respectively, due to an increase in production in South Texas through an active and successful development program in this region as well as an increase in realized price for natural gas of 21%. These increases were partially offset by the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area and a decrease in realized price for oil of 11%.\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \n\nThe Combination\nOn October 21, 2015 the Debtors filed a motion to set a bar date to assist with the claims reconciliation process. On January 26, 2016, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court a joint plan of reorganization (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests in the Debtors and a disclosure statement (the Disclosure Statement\u201d) related thereto. The Plan of Reorganization, if implemented as proposed by the Debtors, would significantly reduce our outstanding long-term debt and annual interest payments. The Disclosure Statement has not yet been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Although the Debtors currently have the exclusive right to file a plan and solicit the appropriate votes thereon, such rights expire on February 10, 2016 and April 11, 2016, respectively. Accordingly, the Debtors have filed a motion to further extend their exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of the Plan of Reorganization, or any other plan, through June 9, 2016 and August 9, 2016, respectively. A hearing on that motion will be held before the US Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2016 and April 11, 2016. There can be no assurances regarding our ability to successfully develop, confirm or consummate the Plan of Reorganization, an alternative plan or reorganization or another alternative restructuring transactions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, which satisfies the conditions of the Bankruptcy Code and is authorized by the Bankruptcy Court.\nSabine O&G is considered the predecessor of Sabine or acquirer of Forest, and, accordingly, the historical financial statements and results of operations of Sabine for periods prior to the completion of the Combination are those of Sabine O&G, as the predecessor, and the historical financial statements and results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2014 include the historical financial statements of Sabine O&G, with the combined operating results of Forest consolidated therein only from the closing date of December 16, 2014 and thereafter. Accordingly, our results of operations discussed in this section may not be indicative of our results of operation following the Combination. The underlying Forest assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us were based on their respective fair market values. No goodwill resulted from the Combination as the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed approximated purchase price.\n \u00b7 Results of Operations - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the annual periods presented in our financial statements \n \u00b7 Sources of Revenue \nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2014 relate primarily to $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on sale of other assets of $1.5 million, as compared to $0.9 million of other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOn December 16, 2014, the Legacy Sabine Investors contributed the equity interests in Sabine O&G to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, which was then known as Forest Oil Corporation. In exchange for this contribution, the Legacy Sabine Investors received shares of Sabine common stock and Sabine Series A preferred stock, collectively representing approximately a 73.5% economic interest in Sabine and 40% of the total voting power in Sabine. Immediately following the contribution, Sabine O&G and related holding companies merged into Forest, with Forest surviving the mergers. Holders of Sabine common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Combination continued to hold their Sabine common stock following the closing, which immediately following the closing represented approximately a 26.5% economic interest in Sabine and 60% of the total voting power in Sabine. On December 19, 2014, Forest Oil Corporation changed its name to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation. In connection with the completion of the Combination, the executive management team of Sabine O&G was appointed as the executive management team of Sabine, and the members of the former executive management team of Forest resigned or were removed from their positions.\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\nProfessional fees included in Reorganization items, net represent professional fees for post-petition expenses. Deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts are related to the New Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes and are included in Reorganization items, net as we believe these debt instruments may be impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process. Terminated contracts are primarily related to the Company's rig and servicing contracts rejected on August 10, 2015 by the Court, effective July 15, 2015. For additional information, please see Note 14 to our financial statements included herein. The terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related to rejection of approved contracts that were not previously included in the balance sheet as the liability was contingent or an executory contract previously reported as commitments and contingencies. Expenses for terminated contracts were based on pre-petition general unsecured claims for damages caused by the Company's breach of contract.\nDuring the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company will operate their businesses as \"debtors-in-possession\" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 852, Reorganizations, applies to entities that have filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The guidance requires that transactions and events directly associated with the reorganization be distinguished from the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, the guidance provides for changes in the accounting and presentation of liabilities, as well as expenses and income directly associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\n \u00b7 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commercial commitments \nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an increase in working capital of $2.2 billion. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the reclassification of our debt from Current maturities of long-term debt\u201d to Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015. In addition, fluctuations are due to the timing and amount of the receivable collections, development activities, payments made by us to vendors, and the timing and amount of advances from our joint operations. For more information on the classification of debt, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWorking Capital\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2015 consist primarily of $19.8 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.9 million of charges related to marketing contract volume commitments. Other operating expenses in 2014 consist primarily of $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on a sale of other assets of $1.5 million.\nSource of Revenues\nOn February 25, 2015, we borrowed $356 million under our New Revolving Credit Facility which represented the remaining undrawn amount under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Our borrowing base under our New Revolving Credit Facility was subject to its semi-annual redetermination on April 27, 2015 and was decreased to $750 million. The decrease in our borrowing base as a result of the redetermination resulted in a deficiency of approximately $250 million which required repayment in six monthly installments in an amount of $41.54 million, beginning May 27, 2015. None of such payments has been made or will be made and pursuant to the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility are currently stayed from taking any action against us as a result of these non-payments. Our cash balance at March 21, 2016 was approximately $173.0 million.\n (1) Oil and NGL production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate combined production and per Mcfe amounts. \nnot a part of our development strategy and will be abandoned. As of December 31, 2015 the Company has no unevaluated properties excluded from the full cost pool.\n \u00b7 Income Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, we were a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax liabilities and/or benefits of Sabine O&G being passed through to its member. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 prior to the Combination as our equity holders were responsible for income tax on our profits. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. Our book and tax basis in assets and liabilities differed at the time of our change in tax status due primarily to different cost recovery periods utilized for book and tax purposes for our oil and natural gas properties. \n* Not meaningful or applicable\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 North Texas, targeting the Granite Wash formation. \nOil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. Revenues from production of oil and natural gas decreased from $462.4 million in 2014 to $335.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 28%. This decrease of $127.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues of $60.3 million, $20.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively, due to a decrease in prices of $40.15/Bbl, $16.31/Bbl and $1.84/Mcf, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a 36% increase in production, primarily due to the Combination and our East Texas development activities.\nPrincipal Components of Cost Structure\nWe evaluate gas gathering and processing equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded no impairment, $1.7 million and no impairment, respectively, based on expected present value and estimated future cash flows using current volume throughput and pricing assumptions. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A). DD&A increased from $137.1 million in 2013 to $189.5 million in 2014, an increase of $52.4 million. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased from $2.15 per Mcfe in 2013 to $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014, or an increase of 18%. The increase in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by reductions to proved reserves due to the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties in North Texas during the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as an increase in the amortization base as a result of development activities without a proportionate increase in reserve volumes.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $18.2 million in 2014 to $17.6 million in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.17 per Mcfe in 2015. The decrease of $0.07 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to lower pricing of 48% per Bbl for oil and 41% per Mcf for natural gas, coupled with processing high cost gas exemptions in 2015, partially offset by increased production associated with the Combination. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 5% and 4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased from $27.5 million in 2013 to $30.4 million in 2014, an increase of $2.9 million, or 11%, as a result of higher overhead associated with our growing\nMarketing, gathering, transportation and other. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $17.6 million in 2013 to $23.6 million in 2014 an increase of 34%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expense increased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014. The increase of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our South Texas development activities as well as gas volumes associated with our Haynesville development activities in East Texas, which were subject to higher fees due to lack of pipeline infrastructure, partially offset by decreases in the average rate per Mcfe due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities in that area.\nChapter 11 Filings\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization. DD&A decreased from $189.5 million in 2014 to $182.4 million in 2015, a decrease of $7.1 million. DD&A decreased from $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014 to $1.79 per Mcfe in 2015, or a decrease of 4%. The decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by a lower amortization base due to recent ceiling test impairments resulting from declines in the prior 12 month pricing and lower PV-10 estimates compared to net book value, coupled with increased total reserves from the Combination.\ndeposited into a segregated account, which is reflected as Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, and is used solely to pay for the operations of the prepetition collateral properties.\nImpairments. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment, a December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2013, there were impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. There were no impairments related to oil and natural gas properties recognized in 2013 as a result of favorable unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $3.67 per MMbtu as compared to $2.76 per MMbtu for the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as favorable performance from our 2013 development activities.\n \u00b7 Interest. During the periods presented, we have historically financed a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. As a result, we incurred interest expense that was affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We also incurred interest expense on our 2017 Notes, and, for the period following the completion of the Combination on December 16, 2014, the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. As of March 21, 2016, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, which will continue to expose us to interest rates. As of March 21, 2016, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Additionally, we capitalized $3.3 million, $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nAlthough we believe our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet the operating costs of our existing business, there are no assurances that our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations or to allow us to continue as a going concern until a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or another alternative restructuring transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated. Our long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of our capital resources and our ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11 plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court. If our future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a going concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement further cost reductions, seek other financing alternatives or seek the sale of some or all of our assets. The Company has temporarily deferred additional development activities. If we (i) continue to limit, defer or eliminate future capital expenditure plans, (ii) are unsuccessful in developing reserves and adding production through our capital program or (iii) implement cost-cutting efforts that are too overreaching, the value of our oil and natural gas properties and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas production. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position, see Part II,\n \u00b7 Reorganization Expense. The Company uses this category to reflect the net revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are the result of the reorganization and restructuring of the business. \nAs a full cost method of accounting company, we capitalize general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to our oil and natural gas activities. We capitalized $9.2 million, $10.1 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $30.4 million in 2014 to $42.7 million in 2015, an increase of $12.3 million, or 41%, primarily as a result of higher overhead associated with the Combination. General and administrative expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.42 per Mcfe in 2015.\n", "item_7_text": "By certain first day\u201d motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, we obtained Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things and subject to the terms of the orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, pay certain employee wages, health benefits and certain other employee obligations, pay certain lienholders and forward funds to third parties, including royalty holders and other partners.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are produced from our interests in properties located onshore in the United States. Oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. Oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly in the second half of 2014 and have remained low through the first quarter of 2016. If commodity prices remain at current levels, we expect significantly lower revenues and operating cash flows compared to historical results.\n\n (2) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of cash settlements on commodity derivative transactions. The Company's calculation of such effects includes gains or losses on cash settlements for commodity derivative transactions. \nGain on derivative instruments. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as cash settlements on commodity derivatives are recognized in our results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $121.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nCash flows from operations are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are primarily affected by the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as commodity prices, net of effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was $134.4 million, $209.2 million and $217.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of decrease in prices, higher interest payments and costs incurred for the Combination and costs incurred in the Chapter 11 Cases. A substantial portion of 2015 cash flow (approximately $76 million) was also derived from changes in working capital during the year. The decrease in cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of the excess in cash outflows for settlements of derivatives, higher interest payments, costs incurred for the Combination and the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma, offset by greater cash proceeds due to 18% higher volumes and 11% higher realized prices.\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013:\n \u00b7 Principal Components of Cost Structure \n\n\nIn particular, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may assert claims against the applicable debtor's estate for such damages. The assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease generally requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors in this Annual Report, including where applicable a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors, is qualified by any overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease and the Debtors expressly preserve all of their rights with respect thereto.\nOn July 15, 2015, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including Giant Gas Gathering LLC, Sabine Bear Paw Basin LLC, Sabine East Texas Basin LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent Gathering LLC, Sabine Mid-Continent LLC, Sabine Oil & Gas Finance Corp., Sabine South Texas Gathering LLC, Sabine South Texas LLC and Sabine Williston Basin LLC (collectively, the Filing Subsidiaries\u201d and, together with us, the Debtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions (the Bankruptcy Petitions\u201d) for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Debtors Chapter 11 cases (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) are being jointly administered under the case styled In re Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, et al, Case No. 15-11835. The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn connection with funding our liquidity and the Combination, we have incurred substantial additional debt. As of December 31, 2015, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, and, as of December 31, 2015, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, our filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under these debt instruments. For a description of our outstanding debt instruments, please see -Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.\u201d The stay under the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to letters of credit and third parties may continue do draw on their letters of credit.\nterminated and we no longer have any derivative contracts in place. See Commodity Hedging Activities\u201d below for more information regarding our economic hedge positions.\nIn 2015 we sold our working interest in various oil and gas properties in our non-core areas at auction for approximately $6.4 million. In December 2013, we sold our working interest in approximately 27,000 net acres in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma areas (including the Cleveland Sands assets acquired in 2012) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $169 million.\n \u00b7 East Texas targeting the Cotton Valley Sand, and Haynesville Shale formations; \nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $99.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $16.1 million, or 16%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility and $5.8 million of interest expense on the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. Additionally, capitalized interest has decreased due to reclassification of unproved oil and natural gas properties in 2014 into the full cost pool as a result of development activities or impairments due to lease expirations and abandonments. We capitalized $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrior to the Combination, Sabine O&G was a privately-held company and Forest's common stock was listed on the NYSE. Currently, the Company's common stock trades on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol SOGC\u201d.\n (2) Interest at contractual interest rates would have been $193.5 million for 2015. As of the petition date, interest is no longer being accrued on the Term Loan Facility, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. \n \u00b7 Production and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas primarily based on the wellhead value of production. The applicable rates vary across the areas in which we operate. As the proportion of production changes from area to area, production tax rates will vary depending on the quantities produced from each area and the applicable production tax rates then in effect. Ad valorem taxes are typically computed on the basis of a property valuation as determined by certain state and local taxing authorities and will vary annually based on commodity price fluctuations. \n \u00b7 Depletion, depreciation and amortization ( DD&A\u201d). This includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with acquisition, exploration, development and related efforts and deplete these costs using the units-of-production method. \n \u00b7 The Combination - a description of the 2014 combination with Forest Oil Corporation \nOverview\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes increased from $17.8 million in 2013 to $18.2 million in 2014, an increase of 2%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in North Texas production due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. This decrease in the rate per Mcfe is partially offset by increases in production tax expenses primarily due to increased production in the South Texas region which is incurring higher production taxes on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 4% and 5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGain on derivative instruments. Gains from the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as cash settlements on commodity derivatives are recognized in our results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized net gains on derivative instruments of $33.9 million and $121.7 million, respectively. The Company's Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under Sabine's existing derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Additionally, certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition.\nReorganization Items, net. Professional fees included in Reorganization Items, net represent professional fees incurred for post-petition expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred by the Company and are presented as reorganization items. Terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related primarily to rig and servicing contracts, certain office leases and other executory contracts, and were not previously included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the liability was contingent in nature or other executory contracts included in commitments and contingencies.\nOur working capital balance fluctuates as a result of timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments, the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners as well as changes in revenue receivables as a result of price and volume fluctuations.\n \u00b7 Chapter 11 Filings - a description of our recent events and our Chapter 11 filings \nOur MD&A includes the following sections;\n \nSignificant Transactions\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above constitutes an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. This debt includes unsecured and under secured obligations which are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed as claims by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and could be material. For additional description of the defaults present under our debt obligations, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nOur filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions described above accelerated our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, the 2017 Notes and the Legacy Forest Notes. We have classified all debt as Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and would be material.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nLease operating expenses. Lease operating expenses increased from $44.6 million in 2013 to $51.3 million in 2014, an increase of 15%. The increase in lease operating expense of $6.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of development activities in South Texas partially offset by the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area. Lease operating expenses decreased from $0.70 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014. The decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area with offsetting increases in South Texas and East Texas as a result of increasing development activities. The following table displays the lease operating expense by area for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and fund our capital expenditures has been negatively impacted by significant decreases in the market price for oil, NGLs and natural gas during the fourth quarter of 2014 with continued weakness throughout 2015. The decrease in the market price for our production directly reduces our operating cash flow. While we historically used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, none of our production is hedged and we may be unable to effectively hedge our production for future periods. In addition, the decrease in the market price for our production indirectly impacts our other sources of potential liquidity.\n\nOur 2016 capital expenditures are forecasted to total approximately $18 million. As a result, we expect production growth from our 2016 capital program will not offset production declines, which will result in material decreases to our production and related cash flows. Consistent with our historical practice, we periodically review our capital expenditures and adjust our budget based on liquidity, commodity prices and drilling results.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2015 we have not entered into additional derivative contracts. Additionally, the filing of our Bankruptcy Petition in July 2015 represented an event of default under our derivative agreements resulting in a termination right by counterparties on all derivative positions at July 15, 2015. Certain of the Company's derivative positions were terminated prior to July 15, 2015 as a result of defaults under Sabine's derivative agreements that occurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition. The terminations resulted in settlements of approximately $24.3 million for which such proceeds were used to reduce the amount of borrowing outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Other terminations resulted in approximately $70.8 million of direct offsets against the New Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the Company no longer has any derivatives beyond July 2015.\nOther than the Combination, which is described under The Combination\u201d above, the following table presents a summary of our significant property acquisitions from 2013 through 2015:\n\nThe following table sets forth additional information concerning our production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013:\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nthe Chapter 11 Cases. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs for the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\n \u00b7 Lease operating, marketing, gathering, transportation and other. These are costs incurred to produce oil and natural gas and deliver the volumes to the market, together with the costs incurred to maintain producing properties, such as maintenance and repairs. These costs, which have both a fixed and variable component, are primarily a function of volume of oil and natural gas produced from currently producing wells and incrementally from new production from drilling and completion activities. Lease operating expenses include workover expenses. \nFor the year December 31, 2014, we recorded total income tax expense of $35 million. The significant differences between our blended federal and state statutory income tax rate of 36% were primarily due to earnings prior to the corporate merger that are not subject to corporate income tax, recording the initial book and tax basis differences associated with the change in tax status, and impairment of non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance. For the year December 31, 2015, we recorded total income tax expense of $3.1 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance which offsets the additional deferred tax assets recorded through purchase accounting for Forest. The significant differences between our blended and state statutory income tax rate of 35.5% were primarily due to the change in the Company's full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset balance, changes in estimate for the 2014 period and state income taxes.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 of each year and more frequently if changes in circumstances warrant. Due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014, a December 31, 2014 impairment test was also performed and resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. No goodwill remains as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n (1) Oil and NGL production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate combined production and per Mcfe amounts. \n \u00b7 Significant Transactions \nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically been equity contributions, borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, net cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from the Term Loan Facility. Our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Since the Chapter 11 filings, our principal sources of liquidity have been limited to cash flow from operations and cash on hand. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with the preparation and administration of\nWe could have a future reduction in asset carrying value for oil and natural gas properties if the average of the unweighted first day of the month oil and natural gas prices for the prior twelve month period declines. For example, as of December 31, 2015, the unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for oil and natural gas were $50.28 per Bbl and $2.58 per MMbtu, respectively, compared to $46.26 per Bbl and $2.39 per MMbtu for oil and natural gas, respectively, in March 2016. Holding all other factors constant, if commodity prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were decreased by $4.02 per Bbl for crude oil and $0.19 per Mcf for natural gas, thereby approximating the pricing environment existing in March 2016, our estimated discounted future cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2015 would decrease by approximately $69 million, or 14%. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties and otherwise if impairment has occurred. In addition, we analyze our unevaluated leasehold and transfer to evaluated properties leasehold that can be associated with proved reserves, leasehold that expired in the quarter or leasehold that is\n \u00b7 Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of transaction costs related to the Combination. \nMarketing, gathering, transportation and other. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $23.6 million in 2014 to $33.9 million in 2015, an increase of 44%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.33 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $10.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our development activities throughout 2014 and 2015, coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities and the Combination.\n\nLease operating. Lease operating expenses increased from $51.3 million in 2014 to $88.9 million in 2015, an increase of 73%. The increase in lease operating expense of $37.6 million is primarily due to an increase in producing properties as a result of the Combination. Lease operating expenses increased from $0.68 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.87 per Mcfe in 2015. The increase of $0.19 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to higher cost legacy Forest production. The following table displays the lease operating expense by area for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from expectations include changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nImpairments. In 2015, as a result of a decrease in commodity pricing, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $1.6 billion and impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment in 2014 the Company tested goodwill for impairment. At December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur acquisitions were financed with a combination of funding from equity contributions from sponsors, borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and cash flow from operations. Because of our substantial recent acquisition activity, the discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods discussed below may not necessarily be comparable with or applicable to future results of operations. Our historical results include the results from recent acquisitions beginning on the closing dates indicated in the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held interests in approximately 272,100 gross (217,000 net) acres in East Texas, 82,900 gross (53,400 net) acres in South Texas and 33,900 gross (25,300 net) acres in North Texas. As of December 31, 2015, we were the operator on 90%, 99% and 99% of our net acreage positions in East Texas, South Texas and North Texas, respectively.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $115.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $180.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $64.7 million, or 56%, primarily as a result of increased borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility, the assumption of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes in connection with the consummation of the Combination on December 16, 2014 and increased amortization of associated debt discounts. No interest expense has been recognized subsequent to the petition date on the Term Loan, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes or the 2020 Notes.\n \u00b7 Impairments. We evaluate the impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties on a full cost basis. Property impairment charges result from application of the ceiling test under the full cost accounting rules, which we are required to calculate on a quarterly basis. The ceiling test requires that a non-cash impairment charge be taken to reduce the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if the carrying value exceeds a defined cost-center ceiling. Because current commodity prices, and related calculations of the discounted present value of reserves, are significant factors in the full cost ceiling test, impairment charges may result from declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $1.6 billion, $247.7 million and no impairment, respectively, of non-cash impairment charges as a result of the full cost ceiling limitation. \nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35.0 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance associated with the Combination. We recorded an additional deferred tax expense of $3.1 million in December 2015 for adjustments related to the net deferred tax expense estimate recorded in December 2014.\n (2) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of cash settlements on commodity derivative transactions. The Company's calculation of such effects includes gains or losses on cash settlements for commodity derivative transactions. \nbusiness. General and administrative expenses decreased on a per unit basis from $0.43 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 production without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses.\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas properties onshore in the United States. Our properties are primarily focused in three core geographic areas:\n \u00b7 General and administrative. This cost includes all overhead associated with our business activities, including payroll and benefits for corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, audit, tax, legal and other professional and consulting fees, insurance and other costs necessary in the management of our production and development operations. \nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process. For example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, and other third parties and our ability to retain employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For a description of these and other risks, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares and shareholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nThe following table sets forth additional information concerning our production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\n* Not meaningful or applicable\n \u00b7 South Texas, targeting the Eagle Ford Shale formation; and \nWe are making adequate protection payments to the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to the non-default rate of interest, fees and costs due and payable on a monthly basis under the New Revolving Credit Facility, in accordance with the cash collateral order filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, cash generated by the Company deemed to be proceeds of the oil and gas properties that represent prepetition collateral is\nIn the past we have used derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of oil and natural gas production, to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce exposure to downward price fluctuations. However, as a result of certain events of default under our derivative contracts, all our derivative instruments have been\nOil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. Revenues from production of oil and natural gas increased from $354.2 million in 2013 to $462.4 million in 2014, an increase of 31%. This increase of $108.1 million was primarily the result of an increase in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues of $48.8 million, $2.6 million and $56.7 million, respectively, due to an increase in production in South Texas through an active and successful development program in this region as well as an increase in realized price for natural gas of 21%. These increases were partially offset by the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area and a decrease in realized price for oil of 11%.\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \n\nThe Combination\nOn October 21, 2015 the Debtors filed a motion to set a bar date to assist with the claims reconciliation process. On January 26, 2016, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court a joint plan of reorganization (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests in the Debtors and a disclosure statement (the Disclosure Statement\u201d) related thereto. The Plan of Reorganization, if implemented as proposed by the Debtors, would significantly reduce our outstanding long-term debt and annual interest payments. The Disclosure Statement has not yet been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Although the Debtors currently have the exclusive right to file a plan and solicit the appropriate votes thereon, such rights expire on February 10, 2016 and April 11, 2016, respectively. Accordingly, the Debtors have filed a motion to further extend their exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of the Plan of Reorganization, or any other plan, through June 9, 2016 and August 9, 2016, respectively. A hearing on that motion will be held before the US Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2016 and April 11, 2016. There can be no assurances regarding our ability to successfully develop, confirm or consummate the Plan of Reorganization, an alternative plan or reorganization or another alternative restructuring transactions, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, which satisfies the conditions of the Bankruptcy Code and is authorized by the Bankruptcy Court.\nSabine O&G is considered the predecessor of Sabine or acquirer of Forest, and, accordingly, the historical financial statements and results of operations of Sabine for periods prior to the completion of the Combination are those of Sabine O&G, as the predecessor, and the historical financial statements and results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2014 include the historical financial statements of Sabine O&G, with the combined operating results of Forest consolidated therein only from the closing date of December 16, 2014 and thereafter. Accordingly, our results of operations discussed in this section may not be indicative of our results of operation following the Combination. The underlying Forest assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us were based on their respective fair market values. No goodwill resulted from the Combination as the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed approximated purchase price.\n \u00b7 Results of Operations - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the annual periods presented in our financial statements \n \u00b7 Sources of Revenue \nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2014 relate primarily to $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on sale of other assets of $1.5 million, as compared to $0.9 million of other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOn December 16, 2014, the Legacy Sabine Investors contributed the equity interests in Sabine O&G to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation, which was then known as Forest Oil Corporation. In exchange for this contribution, the Legacy Sabine Investors received shares of Sabine common stock and Sabine Series A preferred stock, collectively representing approximately a 73.5% economic interest in Sabine and 40% of the total voting power in Sabine. Immediately following the contribution, Sabine O&G and related holding companies merged into Forest, with Forest surviving the mergers. Holders of Sabine common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Combination continued to hold their Sabine common stock following the closing, which immediately following the closing represented approximately a 26.5% economic interest in Sabine and 60% of the total voting power in Sabine. On December 19, 2014, Forest Oil Corporation changed its name to Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation. In connection with the completion of the Combination, the executive management team of Sabine O&G was appointed as the executive management team of Sabine, and the members of the former executive management team of Forest resigned or were removed from their positions.\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\nProfessional fees included in Reorganization items, net represent professional fees for post-petition expenses. Deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts are related to the New Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility, 2017 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes and are included in Reorganization items, net as we believe these debt instruments may be impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process. Terminated contracts are primarily related to the Company's rig and servicing contracts rejected on August 10, 2015 by the Court, effective July 15, 2015. For additional information, please see Note 14 to our financial statements included herein. The terminated contracts represent the estimated claims related to rejection of approved contracts that were not previously included in the balance sheet as the liability was contingent or an executory contract previously reported as commitments and contingencies. Expenses for terminated contracts were based on pre-petition general unsecured claims for damages caused by the Company's breach of contract.\nDuring the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company will operate their businesses as \"debtors-in-possession\" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 852, Reorganizations, applies to entities that have filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The guidance requires that transactions and events directly associated with the reorganization be distinguished from the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, the guidance provides for changes in the accounting and presentation of liabilities, as well as expenses and income directly associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\n \u00b7 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commercial commitments \nIncome Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded, as we were a limited liability company and not subject to federal or state income tax. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. For December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated net deferred tax expense of $35 million to recognize a deferred tax liability for the initial book and tax basis difference associated with the change in tax status, impairment of a non-deductible goodwill and changes in the valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an increase in working capital of $2.2 billion. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the reclassification of our debt from Current maturities of long-term debt\u201d to Liabilities Subject to Compromise\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015. In addition, fluctuations are due to the timing and amount of the receivable collections, development activities, payments made by us to vendors, and the timing and amount of advances from our joint operations. For more information on the classification of debt, please see Note 8 within Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWorking Capital\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses in 2015 consist primarily of $19.8 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.9 million of charges related to marketing contract volume commitments. Other operating expenses in 2014 consist primarily of $25.5 million of transaction costs related to the Combination and $2.0 million for the write-off of previously deferred public offering costs related to offerings which were aborted prior to our decision to commence the Combination, partially offset by the gain on a sale of other assets of $1.5 million.\nSource of Revenues\nOn February 25, 2015, we borrowed $356 million under our New Revolving Credit Facility which represented the remaining undrawn amount under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Our borrowing base under our New Revolving Credit Facility was subject to its semi-annual redetermination on April 27, 2015 and was decreased to $750 million. The decrease in our borrowing base as a result of the redetermination resulted in a deficiency of approximately $250 million which required repayment in six monthly installments in an amount of $41.54 million, beginning May 27, 2015. None of such payments has been made or will be made and pursuant to the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility are currently stayed from taking any action against us as a result of these non-payments. Our cash balance at March 21, 2016 was approximately $173.0 million.\n (1) Oil and NGL production was converted at 6 Mcf per Bbl to calculate combined production and per Mcfe amounts. \nnot a part of our development strategy and will be abandoned. As of December 31, 2015 the Company has no unevaluated properties excluded from the full cost pool.\n \u00b7 Income Tax Expense. Prior to the Combination, we were a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax liabilities and/or benefits of Sabine O&G being passed through to its member. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 prior to the Combination as our equity holders were responsible for income tax on our profits. In connection with the completion of the Combination, we merged into a corporation and became subject to federal and state income taxes. Our book and tax basis in assets and liabilities differed at the time of our change in tax status due primarily to different cost recovery periods utilized for book and tax purposes for our oil and natural gas properties. \n* Not meaningful or applicable\nResults of Operations\n \u00b7 North Texas, targeting the Granite Wash formation. \nOil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. Revenues from production of oil and natural gas decreased from $462.4 million in 2014 to $335.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 28%. This decrease of $127.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues of $60.3 million, $20.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively, due to a decrease in prices of $40.15/Bbl, $16.31/Bbl and $1.84/Mcf, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a 36% increase in production, primarily due to the Combination and our East Texas development activities.\nPrincipal Components of Cost Structure\nWe evaluate gas gathering and processing equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded no impairment, $1.7 million and no impairment, respectively, based on expected present value and estimated future cash flows using current volume throughput and pricing assumptions. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A). DD&A increased from $137.1 million in 2013 to $189.5 million in 2014, an increase of $52.4 million. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased from $2.15 per Mcfe in 2013 to $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014, or an increase of 18%. The increase in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by reductions to proved reserves due to the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties in North Texas during the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as an increase in the amortization base as a result of development activities without a proportionate increase in reserve volumes.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $18.2 million in 2014 to $17.6 million in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on a per unit basis from $0.24 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.17 per Mcfe in 2015. The decrease of $0.07 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to lower pricing of 48% per Bbl for oil and 41% per Mcf for natural gas, coupled with processing high cost gas exemptions in 2015, partially offset by increased production associated with the Combination. We expect to experience continued variability in our production taxes as a result of timing of approval for high cost gas tax exemptions. Production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues were 5% and 4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased from $27.5 million in 2013 to $30.4 million in 2014, an increase of $2.9 million, or 11%, as a result of higher overhead associated with our growing\nMarketing, gathering, transportation and other. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expenses increased from $17.6 million in 2013 to $23.6 million in 2014 an increase of 34%. Marketing, gathering, transportation and other expense increased on a per unit basis from $0.28 per Mcfe in 2013 to $0.32 per Mcfe in 2014. The increase of $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to increased processing of gas volumes associated with our South Texas development activities as well as gas volumes associated with our Haynesville development activities in East Texas, which were subject to higher fees due to lack of pipeline infrastructure, partially offset by decreases in the average rate per Mcfe due to the December 2013 sale of our interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding Oklahoma area coupled with increasing oil volumes associated with development activities in that area.\nChapter 11 Filings\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization. DD&A decreased from $189.5 million in 2014 to $182.4 million in 2015, a decrease of $7.1 million. DD&A decreased from $2.53 per Mcfe in 2014 to $1.79 per Mcfe in 2015, or a decrease of 4%. The decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe is driven by a lower amortization base due to recent ceiling test impairments resulting from declines in the prior 12 month pricing and lower PV-10 estimates compared to net book value, coupled with increased total reserves from the Combination.\ndeposited into a segregated account, which is reflected as Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, and is used solely to pay for the operations of the prepetition collateral properties.\nImpairments. In 2014, there were non-cash impairment charges related to oil and natural gas properties of $247.7 million, impairment charges for gas gathering and processing equipment of $1.7 million and impairment charges for other assets of $0.2 million. Additionally, due to a drop in commodity prices and the $247.7 million ceiling impairment, a December 31, 2014 goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment of our $173.5 million of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2013, there were impairment charges for other assets of $1.1 million. There were no impairments related to oil and natural gas properties recognized in 2013 as a result of favorable unweighted average of the historical first day of the month pricing for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $3.67 per MMbtu as compared to $2.76 per MMbtu for the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as favorable performance from our 2013 development activities.\n \u00b7 Interest. During the periods presented, we have historically financed a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under the Former Revolving Credit Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. As a result, we incurred interest expense that was affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We also incurred interest expense on our 2017 Notes, and, for the period following the completion of the Combination on December 16, 2014, the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes. As of March 21, 2016, the total outstanding principal amount of our long-term indebtedness was $2.752 billion, consisting of indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017 Notes, the Legacy Forest Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, which will continue to expose us to interest rates. As of March 21, 2016, no extensions of credit are available under the New Revolving Credit Facility. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Additionally, we capitalized $3.3 million, $6.5 million and $13.0 million of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nAlthough we believe our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet the operating costs of our existing business, there are no assurances that our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations or to allow us to continue as a going concern until a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or another alternative restructuring transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated. Our long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of our capital resources and our ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11 plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court. If our future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a going concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement further cost reductions, seek other financing alternatives or seek the sale of some or all of our assets. The Company has temporarily deferred additional development activities. If we (i) continue to limit, defer or eliminate future capital expenditure plans, (ii) are unsuccessful in developing reserves and adding production through our capital program or (iii) implement cost-cutting efforts that are too overreaching, the value of our oil and natural gas properties and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas production. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position, see Part II,\n \u00b7 Reorganization Expense. The Company uses this category to reflect the net revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are the result of the reorganization and restructuring of the business. \nAs a full cost method of accounting company, we capitalize general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to our oil and natural gas activities. We capitalized $9.2 million, $10.1 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $30.4 million in 2014 to $42.7 million in 2015, an increase of $12.3 million, or 41%, primarily as a result of higher overhead associated with the Combination. General and administrative expenses increased on a per unit basis from $0.41 per Mcfe in 2014 to $0.42 per Mcfe in 2015.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2015 due to low oil and gas prices, high debt levels, and liquidity constraints. This triggered defaults on their debt obligations.\n\nSignificant Transactions\n- In December 2014, Sabine completed a combination with Forest Oil Corporation which significantly increased their scale and debt load. \n\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\n- Sabine has serious doubts about its ability to continue operations due to bankruptcy filings, debt defaults, low commodity prices, and constraints on liquidity and capital spending.\n\nResults of Operations \n- Revenues decreased 28% from 2014 to 2015 due to much lower oil, NGL and gas prices, despite a 36% increase in production volumes. This led to a large net loss in 2015.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Sabine has extremely limited liquidity. Their only capital sources are existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. Capital spending has been cut dramatically.\n\nReorganization Items\n- Sabine has incurred high professional fees and contract termination expenses related to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.\n\nThe report analyzes Sabine's operating results, financial condition, liquidity constraints, and restructuring efforts associated with their Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Key challenges include low commodity prices, high debt levels, and doubts about their ability to continue operations."}
