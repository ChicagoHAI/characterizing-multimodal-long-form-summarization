Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral Overview\nWe are a leading Spanish-language media and entertainment company with radio and television operations, together with live concerts and events, mobile, digital and interactive media platforms, which reach the growing U.S. Hispanic population, including Puerto Rico. We produce and distribute original Spanish-language content, including radio programs, television shows, music and live entertainment through our multi-media platforms. We operate in two reportable segments: radio and television.\nWe own and operate radio stations located in six of the eight most populous Hispanic markets in the United States: Los Angeles, New York, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Miami and San Francisco. The Los Angeles and New York markets have the largest and second largest Hispanic populations and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the United States measured by advertising revenue, respectively. We format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the Hispanic audience in their respective markets. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable ethnic groups from many different countries of origin, and each ethnic group has its own musical and cultural heritage. Since the music, culture, customs and Spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another, we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various Hispanic ethnic groups. To accommodate and monetize such diversity, we customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve. In addition to our owned and operated radio stations, we have our AIRE Radio Networks with over 250 affiliate radio stations serving 85 of the top 100 U.S. Hispanic markets, including 47 of the top 50 Hispanic markets. AIRE Radio Networks currently covers 94% of the coveted U.S. Hispanic market. Our AIRE Radio Networks reach over 17.4 million listeners in an average week with our targeted networks. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our radio revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local, national and network advertising, and our radio segment generated 89% and 90% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nOur television stations and related affiliates operate under the MegaTV\u201d brand. We broadcast via our owned and operated television stations in South Florida, Houston and Puerto Rico and through programming and/or distribution agreements, including nationally on a subscriber basis, which allow us to serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. We have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment, current events and variety with high-quality content. Our programming is formatted to capture a larger share of the U.S. Hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment\u201d company, thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional Hispanic television channels. MegaTV's programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs, ranging from televised radio-branded shows to general entertainment programs, such as music, celebrity, debate, interviews and personality based shows. As part of our strategy, we have incorporated certain of our radio on-air personalities into our television programming. In addition, we have included interactive elements in our programming to complement our Internet websites. We produce over 50 hours of original programming per week. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our television revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming and generated 11% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively.\nAs part of our operating business, we also maintain multiple Spanish and bilingual websites, including www.lamusica.com, Mega.tv and various station websites that provide content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture, as well as the LaMusica mobile app. The LaMusica mobile app is a music and entertainment video and audio app, that programs an extensive series of short form videos, simultaneously live streams our radio stations', includes hundreds of curated playlists and has tools that enable users to personalize their mobile radio streaming experience. The new video enhancements to our mobile app significantly enhance the audience's engagement level and increases the reach of our mobile offering. In addition, we produce live concerts and events in the United States and Puerto Rico. Concerts generate revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship and promotions, raise awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities and provide our advertising partners additional opportunities to reach their target audience.\nOur Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\nWe have not repaid our outstanding Notes and continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. We provide more information about each of these items under Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d and under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nBusiness Drivers and Financial Statement Presentation\nThe following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general business factors that impact these items.\nNet Revenue Description and Factors\nOur net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers. Net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions, which are generally 15% of gross revenue.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold in a station's local market either directly to the advertiser or through an advertiser's agency. Local revenue includes local spot sales, integrated sales, sponsorship sales and paid-programming (or infomercials). For the years ended 2017 and 2016, local revenue comprised 66% and 67% of our gross revenue, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> National and network revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets. National sales are generally facilitated by our outside national representation firm, which serves as our agent in these transactions. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, national revenue comprised 11% and 13% of our gross revenue, respectively. Network sales consist of advertising airtime sold on our AIRE Radio Networks platform by our network sales staff. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, network revenue comprised 6% and 6% of our gross revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listenership/viewership levels. Each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience. The number of advertisements we decide to broadcast hourly is intended to maximize the station's revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener/viewer levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year.\nOur advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers which are measured by ratings agencies, primarily Nielsen;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of stations, as well as other forms of media, in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the supply of, and demand for, advertising time; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the size of the market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net revenue is also affected by general economic conditions, competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters. Seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our net revenue is typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year.\nIn addition to cash advertising revenue, we also generate revenue from barter sales, special events revenue, interactive revenue, syndication revenue, subscriber revenue and other revenue. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, these revenues combined comprised approximately 17% and 14% of our gross revenue, respectively.\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Barter sales. We use barter sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services. However, we endeavor to minimize barter revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Special events revenue. We generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships, as well as profit-sharing arrangements by producing or co-producing live concerts and events promoted by our radio and television stations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Interactive revenue. We derive internet revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Syndication revenue. We receive syndication revenue from licensing various MegaTV content.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscriber revenue. We receive subscriber revenue in the form of a per subscriber based fee, which is paid to us by cable and satellite providers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other revenue. We receive other ancillary revenue such as rental income from renting available tower space or sub-channels and product endorsements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses Description and Factors\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of (1) engineering and programming expenses, (2) selling, general and administrative and (3) corporate expenses.\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Engineering and programming expenses. Engineering and programming expenses are related to the delivery and creation of our programming content on the air. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in engineering and programming, transmitter-related expenses, originally produced content, on-air promotions, acquired programming, music license fees, and other expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are related to the costs of selling our programming content and administrative costs associated with operating and managing our stations. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in selling and administrative functions, commissions, rating services, advertising, barter expenses, facilities expenses, special events expenses, professional fees, insurance, allowance for doubtful accounts, affiliate station compensation and other expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Corporate expenses. Corporate expenses are related to the operations of our corporate offices and matters. These expenses include compensation and benefits for our corporate employees, professional fees, insurance, corporate facilities expenses and other expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters. In our pursuit to control our operating expenses, we work closely with our local station management and vendors.\nYear Ended 2017 Compared to Year Ended 2016\nThe following summary table presents

Our radio segment net revenues decreased $10.0 million or 8%, due to decreases in local, national and network sales which were offset by increases in special event revenues. Our special events revenue increase occurred primarily in our Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. Our television segment net revenues increased $0.1 million or 1%, due to the receipt of a non-broadcast subscriber based revenue true up payment offset by decreases in local revenues.\nEngineering and Programming Expenses\nThe decrease in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of $0.6 million or 2% was due to the decrease in our television segment's expenses. Our radio segment expenses increased less than $0.1 million or less than 1%, mainly due to lower transmission costs and taxes offset by an increase in content production costs associated with the new LaMusica App and legal settlements. Our television segment expenses decreased $0.7 million or 9%, primarily due to an increase in production tax credits which offset originally produced content production costs in Puerto Rico.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.7 million or 5% was due to increased expenses in our radio segment offset by decreases in the television segment. Our radio segment expenses increased $3.7 million or 7%, primarily due to increases from managing special events through thirds parties to mitigate related exposure, taxes and licenses, AIRE network-affiliate station compensation, bad debt and facilities expenses offset by decreases in sales related commissions and bonuses. Our television segment expenses decreased $1.0 million or 15%, primarily due to decreases in barter, professional fees and commission expenses.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses decreased $0.2 million or 2% primarily due to decreases in professional fees and non-cash stock-based compensation offset by increases in compensation and benefits and airline charters to provide humanitarian relief to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nGain on the disposal of assets\nThe increase in gains from the disposal of assets of $15.9 million was primarily related to having recognized gains on the sale of our Los Angeles facility in June 2017 and the relinquishment of one of our Puerto Rico television station's related spectrum in December 2017.\nRecapitalization Costs\nThe increase in recapitalization costs of $6.0 million was primarily due to professional fees related to the current process of evaluating all options available towards executing a comprehensive recapitalization and restructuring plan. Also included in these amounts are the consent fees paid to the ad hoc group of investors owning more than 75% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes who entered into a forbearance agreement with us on May 8, 2017, as well as the legal and financial advisory fees incurred by these Holders.\nOperating Income\nThe decrease in operating income of $1.6 million or 4% was mainly due to the gain on the disposal of assets offset by the decrease in net revenue and increases in recapitalization, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense, net\nThe decrease in interest expense of $4.3 million or 11% was primarily due to the decrease in amortization of the originally issued discount and deferred financing costs being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Notes, which expired on April 15, 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, our effective tax rate was (489.5)% compared to 111.9% in 2016. The decrease in effective tax rate from 111.9% to (489.5)% is attributed to a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the passage of the Act, change in valuation allowance, and impact of Section 382 ownership change. Exclusive of the impacts from revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the Act, our effective tax rate would have been 198.9%. Our effective tax rate will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income, amount of interest expense disallowance, and the amount of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense changed $33.3 million, from an expense of $8.6 million in 2016 to a benefit of $24.7 million in 2017 primarily as a result of a reduced federal corporate statutory rate. The decrease in the tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Legislation, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $34.7 million in 2017, which represents 688.4% of our effective tax rate in 2017,substantially due to a re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities.\nNet Income\nThe decrease in net loss of $36.0 million was primarily due to the income tax benefit and the decrease in interest expense, net, offset by the decrease in operating income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe most important aspects of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2017 and, as of the date of this Annual Report, are as follows:\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our Notes, of which there are $260.3 million principal amount outstanding, were payable on April 17, 2017. Because we did not have sufficient cash on hand and did not generate sufficient cash from operations, asset sales or the FCC spectrum auction, we did not repay the Notes at their maturity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Certain holders of our Series B preferred stock, of which there is $165.6 million outstanding (comprised of approximately $90.5 million in liquidation preference and approximately $75.0 million in accrued dividends), requested the redemption of their Series B preferred shares on October 15, 2013, which requests we did not satisfy in full. This gave rise to a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event under the Certificate of Designations. One consequence of the existence of a Voting Rights Triggering Event is a prohibition on incurring additional indebtedness, including new indebtedness incurred to refinance outstanding\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> indebtedness, among other things. Every quarter, we accrued additional dividends on the Series B preferred stock at a rate of 10 3/4% per year on the outstanding liquidation preference of the shares (or about $9.7 million per year) and, because we do not make these dividend payments in cash, the outstanding liquidation preference of these shares increased by the dividend amount. A group of purported holders of the Series B preferred stock have sued in a Delaware Chancery Court, which has raised questions regarding the valid ownership of certain foreign entities of the Series B preferred stock, as described under Part I Business -Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our current sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents. During 2017, the cash used by our operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our cash and cash equivalents during the period.

The Company had already recorded a full valuation allowance against existing NOL carry-forwards for accounting purposes such that the impact of the change was immaterial for purposes of its financial statements. In addition, the Company viewed the reduction as immaterial for federal and state income tax purposes because the Company does not expect to utilize all of its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration based on its expectations of taxable income for the foreseeable future, after making various assumptions. The determination of whether the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration is subject to complex assumptions and judgments and, as a result, is subject to various uncertainties. Accordingly, there is a risk that these write-offs and possible future limitations to the Company's NOL carry-forwards based on the operation of Section 382 could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and business. See Note 14 (Income Taxes) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-We face several risks relating to our NOL carry-forwards.\u201d\nWe continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d -Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock.\u201d\nFurther detail regarding some of the items summarized above follows below:\nOur primary source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility or other working capital lines of credit. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used by the Company for operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. Our cash flows from operations are subject to factors impacting our customers and target audience, such as overall advertising demand, shifts in population, station listenership and viewership, demographics, audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. We do not expect to raise cash by increasing our indebtedness for several reasons, including the need to repay the Notes, the existence of an event of default under the Indenture that arose on April 17, 2017 and the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event. In addition, we also face the potential negative impact of an adverse ruling of the Series B preferred stock litigation, which is described in more detail under Part I. Business, Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-The Series B preferred stock Litigation\u201d and Note 15, Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going-concern and do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so, and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed under Critical Accounting Policies-Going Concern.\u201d The Company has also experienced negative cash flows from operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a working capital deficit due primarily to the classification of our Series B preferred stock as a current liability and the classification of our Notes as a current liability. Under Delaware law, our state of\nincorporation, the Series B preferred stock is deemed equity. Because the holders of the Series B preferred stock are not creditors, they do not have rights of, or remedies available to, creditors. Delaware law does not recognize a right of preferred stockholders to force redemptions or repurchases where the corporation does not have funds legally available. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds legally available to be able to redeem or repurchase the Series B preferred stock and its accumulated unpaid dividends. If we are successful in refinancing our Notes, and are able to generate legally available funds under Delaware law, we may be required to pay all or a portion of the accumulated preferred dividends and redeem all or a portion of the Series B preferred stock, to extent of the funds legally available.\nOur strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our ordinary course operating obligations. Management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities, together with cash on hand, should be sufficient to permit us to meet our ordinary course operating obligations over the next twelve-month period. Cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to repay the Notes or to redeem the Series B preferred stock.\nAssumptions which underlie management's beliefs with respect to operating activities include the following:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not deteriorate in any material respect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> despite the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event, we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy; other than with respect to acquisitions and investments requiring proceeds from debt financings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we will use cash flows from operating activities to fund our operations and pay our expenses (including interest on the Notes), but not to repay the Notes or redeem the Series B preferred stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities, including but not limited to taxes, environmental liabilities, regulatory matters or legal judgments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe cannot assure you that these assumptions will be realized.\nHistorically, we have evaluated strategic media acquisitions and/or dispositions and strived to expand our media content through distribution, programming and affiliation agreements in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. Historically, we have engaged in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and/or dispositions and expansion of our content through media outlets from time to time in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event and the need to repay the Notes, we are currently not able to finance acquisitions through the incurrence of additional debt and are subject to additional restrictions which may preclude us from being able to execute this strategy.\nNotes\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $260.3 million principal amount of our Notes and as a result of our failure to pay the Notes at maturity, an event of default of the covenant to repay the Notes under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. However, we continue to pay interest on the Notes on a monthly basis. For more information regarding the Notes, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d and Note 9 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\nOn October 28, 2003, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of 280,000 shares of 10 \u00be% Series B Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. Holders of the Series B preferred stock have customary voting rights and provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $90.5 million of Series B preferred stock due to the liquidation preference and accrued dividends of $75.0 million.\nThe Certificate of Designations entitles the holders of the Series B preferred stock to receive dividends when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors.\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have customary protective provisions. The Certificate of Designations contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: (i) pay dividends, purchase junior securities and make restricted investments other restricted payments; (ii) incur indebtedness, including refinancing indebtedness; (iii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and (iv) engage in transactions with affiliates. Upon a change of control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase these shares at a price of 101% of the aggregate liquidation preference of these shares plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding the purchase date.\nThe Certificate of Designations provided holders the right, on October 15, 2013, to require us to repurchase their shares, subject to the legal availability of funds. At the option of the holder, we were required to repurchase the Series B preferred stock at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, or $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Certain holders of the Series B preferred stock exercised their repurchase option, but we were unable to fully repurchase the Series B preferred stock for which repurchases were requested, resulting in a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event. During the continuation of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, certain restrictions are imposed on us, including (i) a prohibition on our ability to incur additional new indebtedness, (ii) restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments and (iii) restrictions on our ability to merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, upon the incurrence and during the pendency of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, the holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right to elect two members to our Board of Directors. A Voting Rights Triggering Event shall continue until (i) all dividends in arrears shall have been paid in full and (ii) all other failures, breaches or defaults giving rise to such Voting Rights Triggering Event are remedied or waived by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock.\nAs noted above under -Dividends on Series B preferred stock classified as interest expense\u201d, we report dividends on the Series B preferred stock as interest expense.\nFor more information regarding the Series B preferred stock, see Note 11 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn December 23, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio (formerly known as Infinity Media Corporation, CBS Radio), a division of CBS Corporation, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of San Francisco ( Infinity SF\u201d) and SBS Bay Area, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SBS, pursuant to which SBS acquired the FCC license of Infinity SF (the CBS Radio Merger\u201d), we issued to CBS Radio an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share in exchange for the acquisition of all the rights and obligations of Infinity SF, including the FCC license of Infinity SF for radio station 93.3 FM, serving the San Francisco, California market. The shares of Series C preferred stock issued at the closing of the CBS Radio Merger are convertible into 760,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the CBS Radio Merger, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with CBS Radio, pursuant to which CBS Radio may instruct us to file up to three registration statements, on a best efforts basis, with the SEC, providing for the registration for resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C preferred stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Series C preferred stock, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, CBS Radio was given a right of first negotiation with respect to any radio station that we control in the New York and Miami markets after the date of such agreement. The negotiation right is required to stay open for a period of ten (10) business days. In addition, CBS Radio was also given a right to match any offer received by us with respect to any Miami radio station. Such matching right expired one year after the date of the Stockholder Agreement.\nWe are required to pay holders of Series C preferred stock dividends on parity with our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and each other class or series of our capital stock created after December 23, 2004. The Series C preferred stock holders have the same voting rights and powers as our Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to certain adjustments. The Certificate of Designations for the Series C preferred stock does not contain a voting rights triggering event provision like the one found in the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock. Each holder of Series C preferred stock (i) has preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share of any equity securities we may offer, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) may, at their option, convert each share of Series C preferred stock into two (2) shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe terms of the Certificate of Designations for our Series C preferred stock limits our ability to (i) enter into transactions with affiliates and certain merger transactions and (ii) create or adopt any shareholders rights plan.\nOn August 8, 2016 CBS Radio entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with us, AAA Trust and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell and assign its rights related to its 380,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to the AAA Trust for $3.8 million. AAA Trust is a Florida trust, of which Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is the trustee. Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is also the beneficial owner of all the shares of Series C preferred stock held in the AAA Trust. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, CBS Radio agreed to assign the rights under the registration rights agreement and Stockholder Agreement to the AAA Trust, which now holds such registration rights. The parties closed on the Stock Purchase Agreement on August 18, 2016.\nFor more information regarding the Series C preferred stock, see Note 12 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nClass A Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 4,166,991 shares of Class A common stock outstanding.\nClass B Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2,340,353 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding, which have ten votes per share. Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, has voting control over all but 350 shares of the Class B common stock.\nSummary of Capital Resources\nThe following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity. The changes set forth in the table are discussed below. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Radio\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (287\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Television\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (698\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,816\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,099\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,342\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (306\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,036\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe repaid the promissory note relating to the acquisition of the Miami studio building on January 3, 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe decrease in our capital expenditures was primarily due to completed upgrades to television related studio and technical equipment and computer hardware at SBS Miami Broadcast Center in the prior year and reduced current year development costs associated with the LaMusica digital application.\nNet Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nChanges in our net cash flows used in operating activities were primarily a result of the Company commencing to make interest payments on a monthly rather than semi-annual basis on the 12.5% Senior Secured Notes.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nChanges in our net cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of having sold the Los Angeles building and relinquishing the television spectrum in Puerto Rico.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nChanges in our net cash used in financing activities were a result of providing a partial pay down of the principal related to the Notes, in June and September 2017, and paying the promissory note related to the SBS Miami Broadcast Center, which was due in January 2017.\nNASDAQ Delisting; OTCQX; and OTCQB Venture Market\nTrading in our Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ was suspended on January 19, 2017, and trading in our Class A Common Stock on the OTCQX began on the same day. On September 15, 2017, we received written notice from OTC, advising us that the Company had not remained complaint with its $5 million market capitalization minimum rule during the previous 30 calendar days. The OTC also informed us that a grace period of 180 calendar days had begun and would expire on March 14, 2018. Because the Company's market capitalization had not been at or above $5 million for 10 consecutive trading days by that time, the Company moved its Class A common stock from the OTCQX Best Market (US. Tier) to the OTC's OTCQB Venture Market on March 14, 2018, otherwise its Class A common stock would have been moved from OTCQX U.S. to OTC Pink, which may have resulted in further reduced liquidity for our Class A common stock. As a result, the Company's Class A common stock now trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol SBSAA.\u201d\nOn April 3, 2018, we received a written notice from OTC advising us that the Annual Report and the OTCQB Certification for the year ended December 31, 2017 were due on April 2, 2018 but had not yet been provided to OTC. On April 27, 2018, we received a second notice reiterating the same. Under Section 2.2 of the OTCQB Standards, we received a 45 day cure period, or until May 17, 2018, to file the Annual Report on EDGAR and post the OTCQB Certification through the OTC website. The Company received an extension of the 45 day cure period, from the OTC, until May 31, 2018 to file its Annual Report and until June 30, 2018 to post its OTCQB Certification. If we do not post the OTCQB Certification by June 30, 2018, our Class A Common Stock that is currently listed on the OTCQB Venture Market will be downgraded to OTC Pink. We currently intend to post the OTCQB Certification as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any case, prior to June 30, 2018, to maintain our listing on the OTCQB Venture Market.\nEmployees\nIn July 2016, SAG-AFTRA was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent solely for 31 on-air talent employees of our Los Angeles-based stations KXOL and KLAX. We have been negotiating with representatives of SAG-AFTRA for an initial collective bargaining agreement which would cover those 31 employees. To date, we have not yet reached an agreement with SAG-AFTRA, and at this juncture, it is too early to state with certainty whether the parties will ever enter into such an agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nGoing Concern\nWe adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern, during the first quarter of 2016. This standard defines management's responsibility to evaluate conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management's estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements are issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high\nlevel of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or aggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so but, as we have stated under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock,\u201d we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAccounting for Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of FCC broadcasting licenses. FCC broadcasting licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the Act. The Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if: (i) it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act of 1934 or the FCC's rules and regulations by the licensee; and (iii) there have been no other serious violations, which taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. We intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so. Historically, there has been no material challenge to our license renewals. In addition, the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future.\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), we do not amortize our FCC broadcasting licenses. We must conduct impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value. We test our FCC broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market cluster level. We apply the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 350-30-35, Unit of Accounting for Purposes of Testing for Impairment of Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization, to certain of our FCC broadcasting licenses, if their market operations are consolidated.\nDuring 2016, we initiated a change in accounting principle and changed the date of our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, from December 31 to November 30. The change from year-end to such earlier date was preferable to management to facilitate interactions with third party valuation specialists and in order to complete the year-end closing process in a more timely fashion. Management has assessed that the change had no impact on the results of operations in 2017 or 2016.\nOur valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology. This income approach consists of a quantitative model, which assumes the FCC broadcasting licenses are acquired and operated by a third-party. The valuation method used is based on the premise that the only asset that the unbuilt start-up station would possess is the FCC broadcasting license. The valuation method isolates the income attributable to a FCC broadcasting license by modeling a hypothetical greenfield build-up to a normalized enterprise that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for as part of the build-up process. Consequently, the resulting accretion in value is solely attributed to the FCC broadcasting license.\nIn the discounted cash flow projections, a period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analysis. The yearly streams of cash flows are adjusted to present value using an after-tax discount rate calculated for the broadcast industry as of November 30 of each year. Additionally, it is necessary to project the terminal value at the end of the ten-year projection period. The terminal value represents the hypothetical value of the licenses at the end of a ten-year period. An estimated amount of taxes are deducted from the assumed terminal value, which accordingly is discounted to net present value.\nThe key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow model are market revenue projections, market revenue share projections, anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates. These assumptions vary based on the market size, type of broadcast signal, media competition and audience share. These assumptions primarily reflect industry norms for similar stations/broadcast signals, as well as historical performance and trends of the markets. In the preparation of the FCC broadcasting license appraisals, estimates and assumptions are made that affect the valuation of the intangible asset. These estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future.\nThe key assumptions for the respective markets are further described as follows:\nMarket Revenue Projections. Revenues are based on estimates of market revenues gathered from various third-party sources. Total market revenues for 2017 were determined based on this data and market revenues were forecast over the 10-year projection period to reflect the expected long-term growth rates for the broadcast industry and each market. Over the 10-year projection period, revenue growth rates have been projected to return to growth rates equal to the expected long-term growth rate in each market. The long-term growth rates have been estimated based on historical and expected performance in each market. In determining revenue growth rates in each market, revenue growth forecasts from various industry analysts are reviewed and analyzed.\nMarket Revenue Share Projections. Market revenue share projections are based upon the most recent average adjusted audience share for comparable stations operating in each market. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to the average competitor, assuming that competitor had similar technical facilities.\nAnticipated Operating Profit Margins. Operating profits are defined as profit before interest, depreciation and amortization, income tax, and corporate allocation charges. Operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues, net of agency and representative commissions, to compute the operating profit margin. Operating profit margins for each station are projected based upon industry operating margin norms, which reflect market size and station type. In determining operating profit margins in each market, third-party information is utilized. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor.\nRisk Adjusted Discount Rates. Discount rates of 9.5% for radio licenses and 11.5% for television licenses were used to calculate the present value of the net after-tax cash flows. The discount rates are based on an after-tax rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital model as of November 30, 2017. The discount rates are not specific to us or to the stations, but are based upon the expected rates that would be used by a typical market participant, which include a risk premium.\nThese key assumptions are subject to such factors as: overall advertising demand, station listenership and viewership, audience tastes, technology, fluctuation in preferred advertising media and the estimated cost of capital. Since a number of factors may influence the determination of the fair value of our FCC broadcasting licenses, we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future. Any significant change in these factors will result in a modification of the key assumptions, which may result in an impairment.\nFor example, changes in the discount rates will significantly impact our impairment testing. We note that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates would result in an impairment of $7.4 million.\nThe table below presents the percentage within which the fair values of our broadcasting licenses fall relative to their carrying value as of November 30, 2017 for 9 units of accounting (i.e. markets).\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Range by which the Fair Value\nExceeds the Carrying Value for the\nUnits of Accounting as of November 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Greater than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Greater than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 0% to 5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5% to 15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of units of accounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrying value (in thousands)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 139,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to conducting our annual impairment testing, at each interim reporting period we performed a qualitative assessment for each unit of accounting for triggering events that could have indicated impairment to our FCC broadcasting licenses. In this assessment, we considered the qualitative factors that are outlined in FASB ASC 350-30-35-18B, which include, but are not limited to, the state of the economy, advertising demand, market conditions, broadcasting industry future growth rates, regulatory matters and technology. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we determined that there were no impairments of our FCC broadcasting licenses as tested for impairment as of November 30, 2017.\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. ASC 350 requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized. We have determined that we have two reporting units under ASC 350, Radio and Television. We currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit. We have aggregated our operating components (radio stations) into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics, including consideration of the requirements in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, as required by ASC 350. Our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment, business model, gross margins, nature of services and the process for delivering these services.\nThe Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for its radio reporting unit. If the quantitative assessment is necessary, the Company will determine the fair value of its radio reporting unit. If the fair value of its radio reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the Company will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The loss recognized will not exceed the total amount of goodwill.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we performed interim and/or annual impairment reviews of our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. The estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing. In addition, there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit; therefore we considered whether there were any adverse qualitative factors that would indicate that an impairment existed. When evaluating our estimated enterprise value, we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our FCC broadcasting licenses (i.e. our stations) and use of a risk adjusted discount rate. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to: (1) limited trading volume; and (2) the significant voting control of our Chairman and CEO.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. As a result of adopting FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes. As a result, we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our NOL carry-forward period. Therefore, on the date of adoption, we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of NOL, as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes. We expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future with the exception of certain deferred tax assets of a U.S. licensing entity and AMT credits in the U.S., which can be used to offset the indefinite lived intangible DTLs in the U.S. If the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made. The Company's accounting policy is to not record the amount of NOL carry-forwards that will expire due to Section 382 limitations. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust our valuation allowance, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nValuation of Accounts Receivable\nWe review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider our history of write-offs, relationships with our customers, age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in the creditworthiness of customers, general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write-offs.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations, subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an agreement exists, a fixed and determinable price, and reasonable assurance of collection. Our revenue is presented net of agency commissions. Agency commissions, where applicable, are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue. Advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings, less their commission, to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser. We recognize special events revenue from ticket sales, as well as profit-sharing arrangements, as concerts and events are conducted and occur. Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances.\nContingencies and Litigations\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. However, there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition.", "item_7_truncated": "Corporate Expenses\nSummary of Capital

treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. As a result of adopting FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes. As a result, we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our NOL carry-forward period. Therefore, on the date of adoption, we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of NOL, as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes. We expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future with the exception of certain deferred tax assets of a U.S. licensing entity and AMT credits in the U.S., which can be used to offset the indefinite lived intangible DTLs in the U.S. If the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made. The Company's accounting policy is to not record the amount of NOL carry-forwards that will expire due to Section 382 limitations.

ASC 350 requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized. We have determined that we have two reporting units under ASC 350, Radio and Television. We currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit. We have aggregated our operating components (radio stations) into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics, including consideration of the requirements in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, as required by ASC 350. Our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment, business model, gross margins, nature of services and the process for delivering these services.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n \u2022 Our current sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents. During 2017, the cash used by our operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our cash and cash equivalents during the period. Based on current estimates and assumptions, we expect to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow from operations, during 2018, to meet our ordinary course operating obligations over the next twelve month period. \nThe increase in recapitalization costs of $6.0 million was primarily due to professional fees related to the current process of evaluating all options available towards executing a comprehensive recapitalization and restructuring plan. Also included in these amounts are the consent fees paid to the ad hoc group of investors owning more than 75% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes who entered into a forbearance agreement with us on May 8, 2017, as well as the legal and financial advisory fees incurred by these Holders.\n \u2022 We had a working capital deficit of $392.1 million, primarily due to the classification of our Notes and Series B preferred stock as current liabilities. \n \u2022 a station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers which are measured by ratings agencies, primarily Nielsen; \nWe are required to pay holders of Series C preferred stock dividends on parity with our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and each other class or series of our capital stock created after December 23, 2004.

The Certificate of Designations for the Series C preferred stock does not contain a voting rights triggering event provision like the one found in the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock. Each holder of Series C preferred stock (i) has preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share of any equity securities we may offer, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) may, at their option, convert each share of Series C preferred stock into two (2) shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments.\n \u2022 we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities, including but not limited to taxes, environmental liabilities, regulatory matters or legal judgments. \nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nContingencies and Litigations\nThe terms of the Certificate of Designations for our Series C preferred stock limits our ability to (i) enter into transactions with affiliates and certain merger transactions and (ii) create or adopt any shareholders rights plan.\n\nValuation of Accounts Receivable\nNet Revenue\n \u2022 despite the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event, we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy; other than with respect to acquisitions and investments requiring proceeds from debt financings; \nAssumptions which underlie management's beliefs with respect to operating activities include the following:\nOn October 28, 2003, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of 280,000 shares of 10 \u00be% Series B Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. Holders of the Series B preferred stock have customary voting rights and provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $90.5 million of Series B preferred stock due to the liquidation preference and accrued dividends of $75.0 million.\nIn 2017, the Company reduced its NOL carry-forwards by $32.8 million because of ownership changes under Section 382, leaving $86.4 million of federal NOL carry-forwards and $85.4 million of state NOL carry-forwards as of the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company had already recorded a full valuation allowance against existing NOL carry-forwards for accounting purposes such that the impact of the change was immaterial for purposes of its financial statements. In addition, the Company viewed the reduction as immaterial for federal and state income tax purposes because the Company does not expect to utilize all of its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration based on its expectations of taxable income for the foreseeable future, after making various assumptions. The determination of whether the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration is subject to complex assumptions and judgments and, as a result, is subject to various uncertainties. Accordingly, there is a risk that these write-offs and possible future limitations to the Company's NOL carry-forwards based on the operation of Section 382 could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and business. See Note 14 (Income Taxes) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-We face several risks relating to our NOL carry-forwards.\u201d\nOperating Income\nThe decrease in net loss of $36.0 million was primarily due to the income tax benefit and the decrease in interest expense, net, offset by the decrease in operating income.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 the supply of, and demand for, advertising time; and \nAccounting for Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe own and operate radio stations located in six of the eight most populous Hispanic markets in the United States: Los Angeles, New York, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Miami and San Francisco. The Los Angeles and New York markets have the largest and second largest Hispanic populations and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the United States measured by advertising revenue, respectively. We format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the Hispanic audience in their respective markets. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable ethnic groups from many different countries of origin, and each ethnic group has its own musical and cultural heritage. Since the music, culture, customs and Spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another, we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various Hispanic ethnic groups. To accommodate and monetize such diversity, we customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve. In addition to our owned and operated radio stations, we have our AIRE Radio Networks with over 250 affiliate radio stations serving 85 of the top 100 U.S. Hispanic markets, including 47 of the top 50 Hispanic markets. AIRE Radio Networks currently covers 94% of the coveted U.S. Hispanic market. Our AIRE Radio Networks reach over 17.4 million listeners in an average week with our targeted networks. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our radio revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local, national and network advertising, and our radio segment generated 89% and 90% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nThe Certificate of Designations provided holders the right, on October 15, 2013, to require us to repurchase their shares, subject to the legal availability of funds. At the option of the holder, we were required to repurchase the Series B preferred stock at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, or $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Certain holders of the Series B preferred stock exercised their repurchase option, but we were unable to fully repurchase the Series B preferred stock for which repurchases were requested, resulting in a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event. During the continuation of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, certain restrictions are imposed on us, including (i) a prohibition on our ability to incur additional new indebtedness, (ii) restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments and (iii) restrictions on our ability to merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, upon the incurrence and during the pendency of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, the holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right to elect two members to our Board of Directors. A Voting Rights Triggering Event shall continue until (i) all dividends in arrears shall have been paid in full and (ii) all other failures, breaches or defaults giving rise to such Voting Rights Triggering Event are remedied or waived by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock.\nFor more information regarding the Series B preferred stock, see Note 11 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe decrease in our capital expenditures was primarily due to completed upgrades to television related studio and technical equipment and computer hardware at SBS Miami Broadcast Center in the prior year and reduced current year development costs associated with the LaMusica digital application.\n \u2022 Certain holders of our Series B preferred stock, of which there is $165.6 million outstanding (comprised of approximately $90.5 million in liquidation preference and approximately $75.0 million in accrued dividends), requested the redemption of their Series B preferred shares on October 15, 2013, which requests we did not satisfy in full. This gave rise to a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event under the Certificate of Designations. One consequence of the existence of a Voting Rights Triggering Event is a prohibition on incurring additional indebtedness, including new indebtedness incurred to refinance outstanding \nIn connection with the issuance of the Series C preferred stock, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, CBS Radio was given a right of first negotiation with respect to any radio station that we control in the New York and Miami markets after the date of such agreement. The negotiation right is required to stay open for a period of ten (10) business days. In addition, CBS Radio was also given a right to match any offer received by us with respect to any Miami radio station. Such matching right expired one year after the date of the Stockholder Agreement.\n \u2022 Local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold in a station's local market either directly to the advertiser or through an advertiser's agency. Local revenue includes local spot sales, integrated sales, sponsorship sales and paid-programming (or infomercials). For the years ended 2017 and 2016, local revenue comprised 66% and 67% of our gross revenue, respectively. \nNet Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nChanges in our net cash flows used in operating activities were primarily a result of the Company commencing to make interest payments on a monthly rather than semi-annual basis on the 12.5% Senior Secured Notes.\nHistorically, we have evaluated strategic media acquisitions and/or dispositions and strived to expand our media content through distribution, programming and affiliation agreements in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. Historically, we have engaged in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and/or dispositions and expansion of our content through media outlets from time to time in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event and the need to repay the Notes, we are currently not able to finance acquisitions through the incurrence of additional debt and are subject to additional restrictions which may preclude us from being able to execute this strategy.\n \u2022 the size of the market. \nDuring 2016, we initiated a change in accounting principle and changed the date of our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, from December 31 to November 30. The change from year-end to such earlier date was preferable to management to facilitate interactions with third party valuation specialists and in order to complete the year-end closing process in a more timely fashion. Management has assessed that the change had no impact on the results of operations in 2017 or 2016.\nThe table below presents the percentage within which the fair values of our broadcasting licenses fall relative to their carrying value as of November 30, 2017 for 9 units of accounting (i.e. markets).\nTrading in our Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ was suspended on January 19, 2017, and trading in our Class A Common Stock on the OTCQX began on the same day. On September 15, 2017, we received written notice from OTC, advising us that the Company had not remained complaint with its $5 million market capitalization minimum rule during the previous 30 calendar days. The OTC also informed us that a grace period of 180 calendar days had begun and would expire on March 14, 2018. Because the Company's market capitalization had not been at or above $5 million for 10 consecutive trading days by that time, the Company moved its Class A common stock from the OTCQX Best Market (US. Tier) to the OTC's OTCQB Venture Market on March 14, 2018, otherwise its Class A common stock would have been moved from OTCQX U.S. to OTC Pink, which may have resulted in further reduced liquidity for our Class A common stock. As a result, the Company's Class A common stock now trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol SBSAA.\u201d\nClass A Common Stock\nWe review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider our history of write-offs, relationships with our customers, age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in the creditworthiness of customers, general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write-offs.\nThe most important aspects of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2017 and, as of the date of this Annual Report, are as follows:\nThe decrease in interest expense of $4.3 million or 11% was primarily due to the decrease in amortization of the originally issued discount and deferred financing costs being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Notes, which expired on April 15, 2017.\nThe following summary table presents separate financial data for each of our operating segments (in thousands).\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going-concern and do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so, and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed under Critical Accounting Policies-Going Concern.\u201d The Company has also experienced negative cash flows from operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a working capital deficit due primarily to the classification of our Series B preferred stock as a current liability and the classification of our Notes as a current liability. Under Delaware law, our state of\nOperating Expenses Description and Factors\n indebtedness, among other things. Every quarter, we accrued additional dividends on the Series B preferred stock at a rate of 10 3/4% per year on the outstanding liquidation preference of the shares (or about $9.7 million per year) and, because we do not make these dividend payments in cash, the outstanding liquidation preference of these shares increased by the dividend amount. A group of purported holders of the Series B preferred stock have sued in a Delaware Chancery Court, which has raised questions regarding the valid ownership of certain foreign entities of the Series B preferred stock, as described under Part I Business -Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d. \nWe believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. However, there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our inability to repay the Notes at maturity has caused us to conclude there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for purposes of the determination we are required to make in connection with our evaluation of our financial statements for 2017, as described below under -Going Concern.\u201d\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), we do not amortize our FCC broadcasting licenses. We must conduct impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value. We test our FCC broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market cluster level. We apply the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 350-30-35, Unit of Accounting for Purposes of Testing for Impairment of Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization, to certain of our FCC broadcasting licenses, if their market operations are consolidated.\nBusiness Drivers and Financial Statement Presentation\n \u2022 Special events revenue. We generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships, as well as profit-sharing arrangements by producing or co-producing live concerts and events promoted by our radio and television stations. \nOur primary source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility or other working capital lines of credit. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used by the Company for operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. Our cash flows from operations are subject to factors impacting our customers and target audience, such as overall advertising demand, shifts in population, station listenership and viewership, demographics, audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. We do not expect to raise cash by increasing our indebtedness for several reasons, including the need to repay the Notes, the existence of an event of default under the Indenture that arose on April 17, 2017 and the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event. In addition, we also face the potential negative impact of an adverse ruling of the Series B preferred stock litigation, which is described in more detail under Part I. Business, Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-The Series B preferred stock Litigation\u201d and Note 15, Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\nAnticipated Operating Profit Margins. Operating profits are defined as profit before interest, depreciation and amortization, income tax, and corporate allocation charges. Operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues, net of agency and representative commissions, to compute the operating profit margin. Operating profit margins for each station are projected based upon industry operating margin norms, which reflect market size and station type. In determining operating profit margins in each market, third-party information is utilized. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor.\nWe are a leading Spanish-language media and entertainment company with radio and television operations, together with live concerts and events, mobile, digital and interactive media platforms, which reach the growing U.S. Hispanic population, including Puerto Rico. We produce and distribute original Spanish-language content, including radio programs, television shows, music and live entertainment through our multi-media platforms. We operate in two reportable segments: radio and television.\nThe following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity. The changes set forth in the table are discussed below. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are related to the costs of selling our programming content and administrative costs associated with operating and managing our stations. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in selling and administrative functions, commissions, rating services, advertising, barter expenses, facilities expenses, special events expenses, professional fees, insurance, allowance for doubtful accounts, affiliate station compensation and other expenses. \nWe adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern, during the first quarter of 2016. This standard defines management's responsibility to evaluate conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management's estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements are issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high\nWe strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters. In our pursuit to control our operating expenses, we work closely with our local station management and vendors.\nImpact of Inflation\nMarket Revenue Projections. Revenues are based on estimates of market revenues gathered from various third-party sources. Total market revenues for 2017 were determined based on this data and market revenues were forecast over the 10-year projection period to reflect the expected long-term growth rates for the broadcast industry and each market. Over the 10-year projection period, revenue growth rates have been projected to return to growth rates equal to the expected long-term growth rate in each market. The long-term growth rates have been estimated based on historical and expected performance in each market. In determining revenue growth rates in each market, revenue growth forecasts from various industry analysts are reviewed and analyzed.\nIn July 2016, SAG-AFTRA was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent solely for 31 on-air talent employees of our Los Angeles-based stations KXOL and KLAX. We have been negotiating with representatives of SAG-AFTRA for an initial collective bargaining agreement which would cover those 31 employees. To date, we have not yet reached an agreement with SAG-AFTRA, and at this juncture, it is too early to state with certainty whether the parties will ever enter into such an agreement.\nOur strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our ordinary course operating obligations. Management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities, together with cash on hand, should be sufficient to permit us to meet our ordinary course operating obligations over the next twelve-month period. Cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to repay the Notes or to redeem the Series B preferred stock.\nThe following summary table presents a comparison of our operating results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Various fluctuations illustrated in the table are discussed below. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nFor more information regarding the Series C preferred stock, see Note 12 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n \u2022 Other revenue. We receive other ancillary revenue such as rental income from renting available tower space or sub-channels and product endorsements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2,340,353 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding, which have ten votes per share. Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, has voting control over all but 350 shares of the Class B common stock.\nOn April 3, 2018, we received a written notice from OTC advising us that the Annual Report and the OTCQB Certification for the year ended December 31, 2017 were due on April 2, 2018 but had not yet been provided to OTC. On April 27, 2018, we received a second notice reiterating the same. Under Section 2.2 of the OTCQB Standards, we received a 45 day cure period, or until May 17, 2018, to file the Annual Report on EDGAR and post the OTCQB Certification through the OTC website. The Company received an extension of the 45 day cure period, from the OTC, until May 31, 2018 to file its Annual Report and until June 30, 2018 to post its OTCQB Certification. If we do not post the OTCQB Certification by June 30, 2018, our Class A Common Stock that is currently listed on the OTCQB Venture Market will be downgraded to OTC Pink. We currently intend to post the OTCQB Certification as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any case, prior to June 30, 2018, to maintain our listing on the OTCQB Venture Market.\nEngineering and Programming Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we performed interim and/or annual impairment reviews of our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. The estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing. In addition, there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit; therefore we considered whether there were any adverse qualitative factors that would indicate that an impairment existed. When evaluating our estimated enterprise value, we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our FCC broadcasting licenses (i.e. our stations) and use of a risk adjusted discount rate. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to: (1) limited trading volume; and (2) the significant voting control of our Chairman and CEO.\n \u2022 Engineering and programming expenses. Engineering and programming expenses are related to the delivery and creation of our programming content on the air. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in engineering and programming, transmitter-related expenses, originally produced content, on-air promotions, acquired programming, music license fees, and other expenses. \nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 4,166,991 shares of Class A common stock outstanding.\nEmployees\nAs part of our operating business, we also maintain multiple Spanish and bilingual websites, including www.lamusica.com, Mega.tv and various station websites that provide content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture, as well as the LaMusica mobile app. The LaMusica mobile app is a music and entertainment video and audio app, that programs an extensive series of short form videos, simultaneously live streams our radio stations', includes hundreds of curated playlists and has tools that enable users to personalize their mobile radio streaming experience. The new video enhancements to our mobile app significantly enhance the audience's engagement level and increases the reach of our mobile offering. In addition, we produce live concerts and events in the United States and Puerto Rico. Concerts generate revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship and promotions, raise awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities and provide our advertising partners additional opportunities to reach their target audience.\nOur net revenue is also affected by general economic conditions, competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters. Seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our net revenue is typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year.\nGoing Concern\nFor example, changes in the discount rates will significantly impact our impairment testing. We note that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates would result in an impairment of $7.4 million.\nNet Revenue Description and Factors\nThe decrease in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of $0.6 million or 2% was due to the decrease in our television segment's expenses. Our radio segment expenses increased less than $0.1 million or less than 1%, mainly due to lower transmission costs and taxes offset by an increase in content production costs associated with the new LaMusica App and legal settlements. Our television segment expenses decreased $0.7 million or 9%, primarily due to an increase in production tax credits which offset originally produced content production costs in Puerto Rico.\nChanges in our net cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of having sold the Los Angeles building and relinquishing the television spectrum in Puerto Rico.\n \u2022 Interactive revenue. We derive internet revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet. \nGain on the disposal of assets\nWe recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations, subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an agreement exists, a fixed and determinable price, and reasonable assurance of collection. Our revenue is presented net of agency commissions. Agency commissions, where applicable, are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue. Advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings, less their commission, to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser. We recognize special events revenue from ticket sales, as well as profit-sharing arrangements, as concerts and events are conducted and occur. Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\n\n \u2022 Subscriber revenue. We receive subscriber revenue in the form of a per subscriber based fee, which is paid to us by cable and satellite providers. \nThe increase in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.7 million or 5% was due to increased expenses in our radio segment offset by decreases in the television segment. Our radio segment expenses increased $3.7 million or 7%, primarily due to increases from managing special events through thirds parties to mitigate related exposure, taxes and licenses, AIRE network-affiliate station compensation, bad debt and facilities expenses offset by decreases in sales related commissions and bonuses. Our television segment expenses decreased $1.0 million or 15%, primarily due to decreases in barter, professional fees and commission expenses.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors:\nWe have not repaid our outstanding Notes and continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. We provide more information about each of these items under Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d and under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nGeneral Overview\nThe key assumptions for the respective markets are further described as follows:\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nThe Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for its radio reporting unit. If the quantitative assessment is necessary, the Company will determine the fair value of its radio reporting unit. If the fair value of its radio reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the Company will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The loss recognized will not exceed the total amount of goodwill.\nincorporation, the Series B preferred stock is deemed equity. Because the holders of the Series B preferred stock are not creditors, they do not have rights of, or remedies available to, creditors. Delaware law does not recognize a right of preferred stockholders to force redemptions or repurchases where the corporation does not have funds legally available. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds legally available to be able to redeem or repurchase the Series B preferred stock and its accumulated unpaid dividends. If we are successful in refinancing our Notes, and are able to generate legally available funds under Delaware law, we may be required to pay all or a portion of the accumulated preferred dividends and redeem all or a portion of the Series B preferred stock, to extent of the funds legally available.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $260.3 million principal amount of our Notes and as a result of our failure to pay the Notes at maturity, an event of default of the covenant to repay the Notes under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. However, we continue to pay interest on the Notes on a monthly basis. For more information regarding the Notes, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d and Note 9 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates.\n \u2022 Barter sales. We use barter sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services. However, we endeavor to minimize barter revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime. \n \u2022 the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not deteriorate in any material respect; \nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense changed $33.3 million, from an expense of $8.6 million in 2016 to a benefit of $24.7 million in 2017 primarily as a result of a reduced federal corporate statutory rate. The decrease in the tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Legislation, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $34.7 million in 2017, which represents 688.4% of our effective tax rate in 2017,substantially due to a re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities.\n \u2022 National and network revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets. National sales are generally facilitated by our outside national representation firm, which serves as our agent in these transactions. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, national revenue comprised 11% and 13% of our gross revenue, respectively. Network sales consist of advertising airtime sold on our AIRE Radio Networks platform by our network sales staff. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, network revenue comprised 6% and 6% of our gross revenue. \nYear Ended 2017 Compared to Year Ended 2016\nThese key assumptions are subject to such factors as: overall advertising demand, station listenership and viewership, audience tastes, technology, fluctuation in preferred advertising media and the estimated cost of capital. Since a number of factors may influence the determination of the fair value of our FCC broadcasting licenses, we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future. Any significant change in these factors will result in a modification of the key assumptions, which may result in an impairment.\nRecapitalization Costs\nNotes\nOur net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers. Net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions, which are generally 15% of gross revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that these assumptions will be realized.\nRisk Adjusted Discount Rates. Discount rates of 9.5% for radio licenses and 11.5% for television licenses were used to calculate the present value of the net after-tax cash flows. The discount rates are based on an after-tax rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital model as of November 30, 2017. The discount rates are not specific to us or to the stations, but are based upon the expected rates that would be used by a typical market participant, which include a risk premium.\nIn the discounted cash flow projections, a period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analysis. The yearly streams of cash flows are adjusted to present value using an after-tax discount rate calculated for the broadcast industry as of November 30 of each year. Additionally, it is necessary to project the terminal value at the end of the ten-year projection period. The terminal value represents the hypothetical value of the licenses at the end of a ten-year period. An estimated amount of taxes are deducted from the assumed terminal value, which accordingly is discounted to net present value.\nOur Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\nThe decrease in operating income of $1.6 million or 4% was mainly due to the gain on the disposal of assets offset by the decrease in net revenue and increases in recapitalization, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow model are market revenue projections, market revenue share projections, anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates. These assumptions vary based on the market size, type of broadcast signal, media competition and audience share. These assumptions primarily reflect industry norms for similar stations/broadcast signals, as well as historical performance and trends of the markets. In the preparation of the FCC broadcasting license appraisals, estimates and assumptions are made that affect the valuation of the intangible asset. These estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future.\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of (1) engineering and programming expenses, (2) selling, general and administrative and (3) corporate expenses.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\n \u2022 Syndication revenue. We receive syndication revenue from licensing various MegaTV content. \nWe repaid the promissory note relating to the acquisition of the Miami studio building on January 3, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 the number of stations, as well as other forms of media, in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups; \nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, our effective tax rate was (489.5)% compared to 111.9% in 2016. The decrease in effective tax rate from 111.9% to (489.5)% is attributed to a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the passage of the Act, change in valuation allowance, and impact of Section 382 ownership change. Exclusive of the impacts from revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the Act, our effective tax rate would have been 198.9%. Our effective tax rate will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income, amount of interest expense disallowance, and the amount of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates.\nAs noted above under -Dividends on Series B preferred stock classified as interest expense\u201d, we report dividends on the Series B preferred stock as interest expense.\nNet Income\n \u2022 we will use cash flows from operating activities to fund our operations and pay our expenses (including interest on the Notes), but not to repay the Notes or redeem the Series B preferred stock; and \nMarket Revenue Share Projections. Market revenue share projections are based upon the most recent average adjusted audience share for comparable stations operating in each market. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to the average competitor, assuming that competitor had similar technical facilities.\nOur television stations and related affiliates operate under the MegaTV\u201d brand. We broadcast via our owned and operated television stations in South Florida, Houston and Puerto Rico and through programming and/or distribution agreements, including nationally on a subscriber basis, which allow us to serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. We have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment, current events and variety with high-quality content. Our programming is formatted to capture a larger share of the U.S. Hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment\u201d company, thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional Hispanic television channels. MegaTV's programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs, ranging from televised radio-branded shows to general entertainment programs, such as music, celebrity, debate, interviews and personality based shows. As part of our strategy, we have incorporated certain of our radio on-air personalities into our television programming. In addition, we have included interactive elements in our programming to complement our Internet websites. We produce over 50 hours of original programming per week. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our television revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming and generated 11% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of FCC broadcasting licenses. FCC broadcasting licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the Act. The Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if: (i) it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act of 1934 or the FCC's rules and regulations by the licensee; and (iii) there have been no other serious violations, which taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. We intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so. Historically, there has been no material challenge to our license renewals. In addition, the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future.\nNASDAQ Delisting; OTCQX; and OTCQB Venture Market\nOur net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listenership/viewership levels. Each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience. The number of advertisements we decide to broadcast hourly is intended to maximize the station's revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener/viewer levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year.\nOn December 23, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio (formerly known as Infinity Media Corporation, CBS Radio), a division of CBS Corporation, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of San Francisco ( Infinity SF\u201d) and SBS Bay Area, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SBS, pursuant to which SBS acquired the FCC license of Infinity SF (the CBS Radio Merger\u201d), we issued to CBS Radio an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share in exchange for the acquisition of all the rights and obligations of Infinity SF, including the FCC license of Infinity SF for radio station 93.3 FM, serving the San Francisco, California market. The shares of Series C preferred stock issued at the closing of the CBS Radio Merger are convertible into 760,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the CBS Radio Merger, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with CBS Radio, pursuant to which CBS Radio may instruct us to file up to three registration statements, on a best efforts basis, with the SEC, providing for the registration for resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C preferred stock.\n \u2022 Corporate expenses. Corporate expenses are related to the operations of our corporate offices and matters. These expenses include compensation and benefits for our corporate employees, professional fees, insurance, corporate facilities expenses and other expenses. \nWe continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d -Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock.\u201d\nlevel of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or aggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so but, as we have stated under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock,\u201d we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFurther detail regarding some of the items summarized above follows below:\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nCorporate expenses decreased $0.2 million or 2% primarily due to decreases in professional fees and non-cash stock-based compensation offset by increases in compensation and benefits and airline charters to provide humanitarian relief to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nIn addition to conducting our annual impairment testing, at each interim reporting period we performed a qualitative assessment for each unit of accounting for triggering events that could have indicated impairment to our FCC broadcasting licenses. In this assessment, we considered the qualitative factors that are outlined in FASB ASC 350-30-35-18B, which include, but are not limited to, the state of the economy, advertising demand, market conditions, broadcasting industry future growth rates, regulatory matters and technology. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we determined that there were no impairments of our FCC broadcasting licenses as tested for impairment as of November 30, 2017.\n \u2022 Our Notes, of which there are $260.3 million principal amount outstanding, were payable on April 17, 2017. Because we did not have sufficient cash on hand and did not generate sufficient cash from operations, asset sales or the FCC spectrum auction, we did not repay the Notes at their maturity. \nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe increase in gains from the disposal of assets of $15.9 million was primarily related to having recognized gains on the sale of our Los Angeles facility in June 2017 and the relinquishment of one of our Puerto Rico television station's related spectrum in December 2017.\nThe Certificate of Designations entitles the holders of the Series B preferred stock to receive dividends when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors.\nOn August 8, 2016 CBS Radio entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with us, AAA Trust and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell and assign its rights related to its 380,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to the AAA Trust for $3.8 million. AAA Trust is a Florida trust, of which Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is the trustee. Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is also the beneficial owner of all the shares of Series C preferred stock held in the AAA Trust. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, CBS Radio agreed to assign the rights under the registration rights agreement and Stockholder Agreement to the AAA Trust, which now holds such registration rights. The parties closed on the Stock Purchase Agreement on August 18, 2016.\nThe decrease in our consolidated net revenues of $9.9 million or 7% was due to decreases in our radio segment offset by increases in our television segment net revenues. Our radio segment net revenues decreased $10.0 million or 8%, due to decreases in local, national and network sales which were offset by increases in special event revenues. Our special events revenue increase occurred primarily in our Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. Our television segment net revenues increased $0.1 million or 1%, due to the receipt of a non-broadcast subscriber based revenue true up payment offset by decreases in local revenues.\nOur valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology. This income approach consists of a quantitative model, which assumes the FCC broadcasting licenses are acquired and operated by a third-party. The valuation method used is based on the premise that the only asset that the unbuilt start-up station would possess is the FCC broadcasting license. The valuation method isolates the income attributable to a FCC broadcasting license by modeling a hypothetical greenfield build-up to a normalized enterprise that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for as part of the build-up process. Consequently, the resulting accretion in value is solely attributed to the FCC broadcasting license.\nInterest Expense, net\nClass B Common Stock\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have customary protective provisions. The Certificate of Designations contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: (i) pay dividends, purchase junior securities and make restricted investments other restricted payments; (ii) incur indebtedness, including refinancing indebtedness; (iii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and (iv) engage in transactions with affiliates. Upon a change of control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase these shares at a price of 101% of the aggregate liquidation preference of these shares plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding the purchase date.", "item_7_text": "Corporate Expenses\nSummary of Capital Resources\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nThe following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general business factors that impact these items.\nChanges in our net cash used in financing activities were a result of providing a partial pay down of the principal related to the Notes, in June and September 2017, and paying the promissory note related to the SBS Miami Broadcast Center, which was due in January 2017.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. As a result of adopting FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes. As a result, we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our NOL carry-forward period. Therefore, on the date of adoption, we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of NOL, as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes. We expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future with the exception of certain deferred tax assets of a U.S. licensing entity and AMT credits in the U.S., which can be used to offset the indefinite lived intangible DTLs in the U.S. If the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made. The Company's accounting policy is to not record the amount of NOL carry-forwards that will expire due to Section 382 limitations. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust our valuation allowance, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn addition to cash advertising revenue, we also generate revenue from barter sales, special events revenue, interactive revenue, syndication revenue, subscriber revenue and other revenue. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, these revenues combined comprised approximately 17% and 14% of our gross revenue, respectively.\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. ASC 350 requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized. We have determined that we have two reporting units under ASC 350, Radio and Television. We currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit. We have aggregated our operating components (radio stations) into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics, including consideration of the requirements in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, as required by ASC 350. Our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment, business model, gross margins, nature of services and the process for delivering these services.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n \u2022 Our current sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents. During 2017, the cash used by our operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our cash and cash equivalents during the period. Based on current estimates and assumptions, we expect to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow from operations, during 2018, to meet our ordinary course operating obligations over the next twelve month period. \nThe increase in recapitalization costs of $6.0 million was primarily due to professional fees related to the current process of evaluating all options available towards executing a comprehensive recapitalization and restructuring plan. Also included in these amounts are the consent fees paid to the ad hoc group of investors owning more than 75% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes who entered into a forbearance agreement with us on May 8, 2017, as well as the legal and financial advisory fees incurred by these Holders.\n \u2022 We had a working capital deficit of $392.1 million, primarily due to the classification of our Notes and Series B preferred stock as current liabilities. \n \u2022 a station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers which are measured by ratings agencies, primarily Nielsen; \nWe are required to pay holders of Series C preferred stock dividends on parity with our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and each other class or series of our capital stock created after December 23, 2004. The Series C preferred stock holders have the same voting rights and powers as our Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to certain adjustments. The Certificate of Designations for the Series C preferred stock does not contain a voting rights triggering event provision like the one found in the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock. Each holder of Series C preferred stock (i) has preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share of any equity securities we may offer, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) may, at their option, convert each share of Series C preferred stock into two (2) shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments.\n \u2022 we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities, including but not limited to taxes, environmental liabilities, regulatory matters or legal judgments. \nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nContingencies and Litigations\nThe terms of the Certificate of Designations for our Series C preferred stock limits our ability to (i) enter into transactions with affiliates and certain merger transactions and (ii) create or adopt any shareholders rights plan.\n\nValuation of Accounts Receivable\nNet Revenue\n \u2022 despite the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event, we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy; other than with respect to acquisitions and investments requiring proceeds from debt financings; \nAssumptions which underlie management's beliefs with respect to operating activities include the following:\nOn October 28, 2003, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of 280,000 shares of 10 \u00be% Series B Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. Holders of the Series B preferred stock have customary voting rights and provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $90.5 million of Series B preferred stock due to the liquidation preference and accrued dividends of $75.0 million.\nIn 2017, the Company reduced its NOL carry-forwards by $32.8 million because of ownership changes under Section 382, leaving $86.4 million of federal NOL carry-forwards and $85.4 million of state NOL carry-forwards as of the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company had already recorded a full valuation allowance against existing NOL carry-forwards for accounting purposes such that the impact of the change was immaterial for purposes of its financial statements. In addition, the Company viewed the reduction as immaterial for federal and state income tax purposes because the Company does not expect to utilize all of its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration based on its expectations of taxable income for the foreseeable future, after making various assumptions. The determination of whether the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its remaining NOL carry-forwards prior to expiration is subject to complex assumptions and judgments and, as a result, is subject to various uncertainties. Accordingly, there is a risk that these write-offs and possible future limitations to the Company's NOL carry-forwards based on the operation of Section 382 could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and business. See Note 14 (Income Taxes) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-We face several risks relating to our NOL carry-forwards.\u201d\nOperating Income\nThe decrease in net loss of $36.0 million was primarily due to the income tax benefit and the decrease in interest expense, net, offset by the decrease in operating income.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 the supply of, and demand for, advertising time; and \nAccounting for Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe own and operate radio stations located in six of the eight most populous Hispanic markets in the United States: Los Angeles, New York, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Miami and San Francisco. The Los Angeles and New York markets have the largest and second largest Hispanic populations and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the United States measured by advertising revenue, respectively. We format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the Hispanic audience in their respective markets. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable ethnic groups from many different countries of origin, and each ethnic group has its own musical and cultural heritage. Since the music, culture, customs and Spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another, we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various Hispanic ethnic groups. To accommodate and monetize such diversity, we customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve. In addition to our owned and operated radio stations, we have our AIRE Radio Networks with over 250 affiliate radio stations serving 85 of the top 100 U.S. Hispanic markets, including 47 of the top 50 Hispanic markets. AIRE Radio Networks currently covers 94% of the coveted U.S. Hispanic market. Our AIRE Radio Networks reach over 17.4 million listeners in an average week with our targeted networks. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our radio revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local, national and network advertising, and our radio segment generated 89% and 90% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nThe Certificate of Designations provided holders the right, on October 15, 2013, to require us to repurchase their shares, subject to the legal availability of funds. At the option of the holder, we were required to repurchase the Series B preferred stock at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, or $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Certain holders of the Series B preferred stock exercised their repurchase option, but we were unable to fully repurchase the Series B preferred stock for which repurchases were requested, resulting in a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event. During the continuation of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, certain restrictions are imposed on us, including (i) a prohibition on our ability to incur additional new indebtedness, (ii) restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments and (iii) restrictions on our ability to merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, upon the incurrence and during the pendency of a Voting Rights Triggering Event, the holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right to elect two members to our Board of Directors. A Voting Rights Triggering Event shall continue until (i) all dividends in arrears shall have been paid in full and (ii) all other failures, breaches or defaults giving rise to such Voting Rights Triggering Event are remedied or waived by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock.\nFor more information regarding the Series B preferred stock, see Note 11 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe decrease in our capital expenditures was primarily due to completed upgrades to television related studio and technical equipment and computer hardware at SBS Miami Broadcast Center in the prior year and reduced current year development costs associated with the LaMusica digital application.\n \u2022 Certain holders of our Series B preferred stock, of which there is $165.6 million outstanding (comprised of approximately $90.5 million in liquidation preference and approximately $75.0 million in accrued dividends), requested the redemption of their Series B preferred shares on October 15, 2013, which requests we did not satisfy in full. This gave rise to a continuing Voting Rights Triggering Event under the Certificate of Designations. One consequence of the existence of a Voting Rights Triggering Event is a prohibition on incurring additional indebtedness, including new indebtedness incurred to refinance outstanding \nIn connection with the issuance of the Series C preferred stock, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, CBS Radio was given a right of first negotiation with respect to any radio station that we control in the New York and Miami markets after the date of such agreement. The negotiation right is required to stay open for a period of ten (10) business days. In addition, CBS Radio was also given a right to match any offer received by us with respect to any Miami radio station. Such matching right expired one year after the date of the Stockholder Agreement.\n \u2022 Local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold in a station's local market either directly to the advertiser or through an advertiser's agency. Local revenue includes local spot sales, integrated sales, sponsorship sales and paid-programming (or infomercials). For the years ended 2017 and 2016, local revenue comprised 66% and 67% of our gross revenue, respectively. \nNet Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nChanges in our net cash flows used in operating activities were primarily a result of the Company commencing to make interest payments on a monthly rather than semi-annual basis on the 12.5% Senior Secured Notes.\nHistorically, we have evaluated strategic media acquisitions and/or dispositions and strived to expand our media content through distribution, programming and affiliation agreements in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. Historically, we have engaged in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and/or dispositions and expansion of our content through media outlets from time to time in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the consequences resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event and the need to repay the Notes, we are currently not able to finance acquisitions through the incurrence of additional debt and are subject to additional restrictions which may preclude us from being able to execute this strategy.\n \u2022 the size of the market. \nDuring 2016, we initiated a change in accounting principle and changed the date of our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, from December 31 to November 30. The change from year-end to such earlier date was preferable to management to facilitate interactions with third party valuation specialists and in order to complete the year-end closing process in a more timely fashion. Management has assessed that the change had no impact on the results of operations in 2017 or 2016.\nThe table below presents the percentage within which the fair values of our broadcasting licenses fall relative to their carrying value as of November 30, 2017 for 9 units of accounting (i.e. markets).\nTrading in our Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ was suspended on January 19, 2017, and trading in our Class A Common Stock on the OTCQX began on the same day. On September 15, 2017, we received written notice from OTC, advising us that the Company had not remained complaint with its $5 million market capitalization minimum rule during the previous 30 calendar days. The OTC also informed us that a grace period of 180 calendar days had begun and would expire on March 14, 2018. Because the Company's market capitalization had not been at or above $5 million for 10 consecutive trading days by that time, the Company moved its Class A common stock from the OTCQX Best Market (US. Tier) to the OTC's OTCQB Venture Market on March 14, 2018, otherwise its Class A common stock would have been moved from OTCQX U.S. to OTC Pink, which may have resulted in further reduced liquidity for our Class A common stock. As a result, the Company's Class A common stock now trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol SBSAA.\u201d\nClass A Common Stock\nWe review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider our history of write-offs, relationships with our customers, age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in the creditworthiness of customers, general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write-offs.\nThe most important aspects of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2017 and, as of the date of this Annual Report, are as follows:\nThe decrease in interest expense of $4.3 million or 11% was primarily due to the decrease in amortization of the originally issued discount and deferred financing costs being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Notes, which expired on April 15, 2017.\nThe following summary table presents separate financial data for each of our operating segments (in thousands).\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going-concern and do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so, and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed under Critical Accounting Policies-Going Concern.\u201d The Company has also experienced negative cash flows from operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a working capital deficit due primarily to the classification of our Series B preferred stock as a current liability and the classification of our Notes as a current liability. Under Delaware law, our state of\nOperating Expenses Description and Factors\n indebtedness, among other things. Every quarter, we accrued additional dividends on the Series B preferred stock at a rate of 10 3/4% per year on the outstanding liquidation preference of the shares (or about $9.7 million per year) and, because we do not make these dividend payments in cash, the outstanding liquidation preference of these shares increased by the dividend amount. A group of purported holders of the Series B preferred stock have sued in a Delaware Chancery Court, which has raised questions regarding the valid ownership of certain foreign entities of the Series B preferred stock, as described under Part I Business -Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d. \nWe believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. However, there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our inability to repay the Notes at maturity has caused us to conclude there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for purposes of the determination we are required to make in connection with our evaluation of our financial statements for 2017, as described below under -Going Concern.\u201d\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), we do not amortize our FCC broadcasting licenses. We must conduct impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value. We test our FCC broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market cluster level. We apply the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 350-30-35, Unit of Accounting for Purposes of Testing for Impairment of Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization, to certain of our FCC broadcasting licenses, if their market operations are consolidated.\nBusiness Drivers and Financial Statement Presentation\n \u2022 Special events revenue. We generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships, as well as profit-sharing arrangements by producing or co-producing live concerts and events promoted by our radio and television stations. \nOur primary source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility or other working capital lines of credit. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used by the Company for operations and to repay the promissory note earlier in the year exceeded the cash provided by our operations which reduced our current cash and cash equivalents during the period. Our cash flows from operations are subject to factors impacting our customers and target audience, such as overall advertising demand, shifts in population, station listenership and viewership, demographics, audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. We do not expect to raise cash by increasing our indebtedness for several reasons, including the need to repay the Notes, the existence of an event of default under the Indenture that arose on April 17, 2017 and the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event. In addition, we also face the potential negative impact of an adverse ruling of the Series B preferred stock litigation, which is described in more detail under Part I. Business, Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-The Series B preferred stock Litigation\u201d and Note 15, Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\nAnticipated Operating Profit Margins. Operating profits are defined as profit before interest, depreciation and amortization, income tax, and corporate allocation charges. Operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues, net of agency and representative commissions, to compute the operating profit margin. Operating profit margins for each station are projected based upon industry operating margin norms, which reflect market size and station type. In determining operating profit margins in each market, third-party information is utilized. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor.\nWe are a leading Spanish-language media and entertainment company with radio and television operations, together with live concerts and events, mobile, digital and interactive media platforms, which reach the growing U.S. Hispanic population, including Puerto Rico. We produce and distribute original Spanish-language content, including radio programs, television shows, music and live entertainment through our multi-media platforms. We operate in two reportable segments: radio and television.\nThe following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity. The changes set forth in the table are discussed below. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are related to the costs of selling our programming content and administrative costs associated with operating and managing our stations. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in selling and administrative functions, commissions, rating services, advertising, barter expenses, facilities expenses, special events expenses, professional fees, insurance, allowance for doubtful accounts, affiliate station compensation and other expenses. \nWe adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern, during the first quarter of 2016. This standard defines management's responsibility to evaluate conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management's estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements are issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high\nWe strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters. In our pursuit to control our operating expenses, we work closely with our local station management and vendors.\nImpact of Inflation\nMarket Revenue Projections. Revenues are based on estimates of market revenues gathered from various third-party sources. Total market revenues for 2017 were determined based on this data and market revenues were forecast over the 10-year projection period to reflect the expected long-term growth rates for the broadcast industry and each market. Over the 10-year projection period, revenue growth rates have been projected to return to growth rates equal to the expected long-term growth rate in each market. The long-term growth rates have been estimated based on historical and expected performance in each market. In determining revenue growth rates in each market, revenue growth forecasts from various industry analysts are reviewed and analyzed.\nIn July 2016, SAG-AFTRA was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent solely for 31 on-air talent employees of our Los Angeles-based stations KXOL and KLAX. We have been negotiating with representatives of SAG-AFTRA for an initial collective bargaining agreement which would cover those 31 employees. To date, we have not yet reached an agreement with SAG-AFTRA, and at this juncture, it is too early to state with certainty whether the parties will ever enter into such an agreement.\nOur strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our ordinary course operating obligations. Management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities, together with cash on hand, should be sufficient to permit us to meet our ordinary course operating obligations over the next twelve-month period. Cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to repay the Notes or to redeem the Series B preferred stock.\nThe following summary table presents a comparison of our operating results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Various fluctuations illustrated in the table are discussed below. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nFor more information regarding the Series C preferred stock, see Note 12 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n \u2022 Other revenue. We receive other ancillary revenue such as rental income from renting available tower space or sub-channels and product endorsements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2,340,353 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding, which have ten votes per share. Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, has voting control over all but 350 shares of the Class B common stock.\nOn April 3, 2018, we received a written notice from OTC advising us that the Annual Report and the OTCQB Certification for the year ended December 31, 2017 were due on April 2, 2018 but had not yet been provided to OTC. On April 27, 2018, we received a second notice reiterating the same. Under Section 2.2 of the OTCQB Standards, we received a 45 day cure period, or until May 17, 2018, to file the Annual Report on EDGAR and post the OTCQB Certification through the OTC website. The Company received an extension of the 45 day cure period, from the OTC, until May 31, 2018 to file its Annual Report and until June 30, 2018 to post its OTCQB Certification. If we do not post the OTCQB Certification by June 30, 2018, our Class A Common Stock that is currently listed on the OTCQB Venture Market will be downgraded to OTC Pink. We currently intend to post the OTCQB Certification as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any case, prior to June 30, 2018, to maintain our listing on the OTCQB Venture Market.\nEngineering and Programming Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we performed interim and/or annual impairment reviews of our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. The estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing. In addition, there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit; therefore we considered whether there were any adverse qualitative factors that would indicate that an impairment existed. When evaluating our estimated enterprise value, we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our FCC broadcasting licenses (i.e. our stations) and use of a risk adjusted discount rate. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to: (1) limited trading volume; and (2) the significant voting control of our Chairman and CEO.\n \u2022 Engineering and programming expenses. Engineering and programming expenses are related to the delivery and creation of our programming content on the air. These expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in engineering and programming, transmitter-related expenses, originally produced content, on-air promotions, acquired programming, music license fees, and other expenses. \nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 4,166,991 shares of Class A common stock outstanding.\nEmployees\nAs part of our operating business, we also maintain multiple Spanish and bilingual websites, including www.lamusica.com, Mega.tv and various station websites that provide content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture, as well as the LaMusica mobile app. The LaMusica mobile app is a music and entertainment video and audio app, that programs an extensive series of short form videos, simultaneously live streams our radio stations', includes hundreds of curated playlists and has tools that enable users to personalize their mobile radio streaming experience. The new video enhancements to our mobile app significantly enhance the audience's engagement level and increases the reach of our mobile offering. In addition, we produce live concerts and events in the United States and Puerto Rico. Concerts generate revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship and promotions, raise awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities and provide our advertising partners additional opportunities to reach their target audience.\nOur net revenue is also affected by general economic conditions, competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters. Seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our net revenue is typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year.\nGoing Concern\nFor example, changes in the discount rates will significantly impact our impairment testing. We note that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates would result in an impairment of $7.4 million.\nNet Revenue Description and Factors\nThe decrease in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of $0.6 million or 2% was due to the decrease in our television segment's expenses. Our radio segment expenses increased less than $0.1 million or less than 1%, mainly due to lower transmission costs and taxes offset by an increase in content production costs associated with the new LaMusica App and legal settlements. Our television segment expenses decreased $0.7 million or 9%, primarily due to an increase in production tax credits which offset originally produced content production costs in Puerto Rico.\nChanges in our net cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of having sold the Los Angeles building and relinquishing the television spectrum in Puerto Rico.\n \u2022 Interactive revenue. We derive internet revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet. \nGain on the disposal of assets\nWe recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations, subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an agreement exists, a fixed and determinable price, and reasonable assurance of collection. Our revenue is presented net of agency commissions. Agency commissions, where applicable, are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue. Advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings, less their commission, to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser. We recognize special events revenue from ticket sales, as well as profit-sharing arrangements, as concerts and events are conducted and occur. Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\n\n \u2022 Subscriber revenue. We receive subscriber revenue in the form of a per subscriber based fee, which is paid to us by cable and satellite providers. \nThe increase in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.7 million or 5% was due to increased expenses in our radio segment offset by decreases in the television segment. Our radio segment expenses increased $3.7 million or 7%, primarily due to increases from managing special events through thirds parties to mitigate related exposure, taxes and licenses, AIRE network-affiliate station compensation, bad debt and facilities expenses offset by decreases in sales related commissions and bonuses. Our television segment expenses decreased $1.0 million or 15%, primarily due to decreases in barter, professional fees and commission expenses.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors:\nWe have not repaid our outstanding Notes and continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. We provide more information about each of these items under Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d and under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nGeneral Overview\nThe key assumptions for the respective markets are further described as follows:\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nThe Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for its radio reporting unit. If the quantitative assessment is necessary, the Company will determine the fair value of its radio reporting unit. If the fair value of its radio reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the Company will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The loss recognized will not exceed the total amount of goodwill.\nincorporation, the Series B preferred stock is deemed equity. Because the holders of the Series B preferred stock are not creditors, they do not have rights of, or remedies available to, creditors. Delaware law does not recognize a right of preferred stockholders to force redemptions or repurchases where the corporation does not have funds legally available. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds legally available to be able to redeem or repurchase the Series B preferred stock and its accumulated unpaid dividends. If we are successful in refinancing our Notes, and are able to generate legally available funds under Delaware law, we may be required to pay all or a portion of the accumulated preferred dividends and redeem all or a portion of the Series B preferred stock, to extent of the funds legally available.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding $260.3 million principal amount of our Notes and as a result of our failure to pay the Notes at maturity, an event of default of the covenant to repay the Notes under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. However, we continue to pay interest on the Notes on a monthly basis. For more information regarding the Notes, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\u201d and Note 9 to our 2017 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates.\n \u2022 Barter sales. We use barter sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services. However, we endeavor to minimize barter revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime. \n \u2022 the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not deteriorate in any material respect; \nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense changed $33.3 million, from an expense of $8.6 million in 2016 to a benefit of $24.7 million in 2017 primarily as a result of a reduced federal corporate statutory rate. The decrease in the tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Legislation, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $34.7 million in 2017, which represents 688.4% of our effective tax rate in 2017,substantially due to a re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities.\n \u2022 National and network revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets. National sales are generally facilitated by our outside national representation firm, which serves as our agent in these transactions. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, national revenue comprised 11% and 13% of our gross revenue, respectively. Network sales consist of advertising airtime sold on our AIRE Radio Networks platform by our network sales staff. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, network revenue comprised 6% and 6% of our gross revenue. \nYear Ended 2017 Compared to Year Ended 2016\nThese key assumptions are subject to such factors as: overall advertising demand, station listenership and viewership, audience tastes, technology, fluctuation in preferred advertising media and the estimated cost of capital. Since a number of factors may influence the determination of the fair value of our FCC broadcasting licenses, we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future. Any significant change in these factors will result in a modification of the key assumptions, which may result in an impairment.\nRecapitalization Costs\nNotes\nOur net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers. Net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions, which are generally 15% of gross revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that these assumptions will be realized.\nRisk Adjusted Discount Rates. Discount rates of 9.5% for radio licenses and 11.5% for television licenses were used to calculate the present value of the net after-tax cash flows. The discount rates are based on an after-tax rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital model as of November 30, 2017. The discount rates are not specific to us or to the stations, but are based upon the expected rates that would be used by a typical market participant, which include a risk premium.\nIn the discounted cash flow projections, a period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analysis. The yearly streams of cash flows are adjusted to present value using an after-tax discount rate calculated for the broadcast industry as of November 30 of each year. Additionally, it is necessary to project the terminal value at the end of the ten-year projection period. The terminal value represents the hypothetical value of the licenses at the end of a ten-year period. An estimated amount of taxes are deducted from the assumed terminal value, which accordingly is discounted to net present value.\nOur Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts\nThe decrease in operating income of $1.6 million or 4% was mainly due to the gain on the disposal of assets offset by the decrease in net revenue and increases in recapitalization, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow model are market revenue projections, market revenue share projections, anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates. These assumptions vary based on the market size, type of broadcast signal, media competition and audience share. These assumptions primarily reflect industry norms for similar stations/broadcast signals, as well as historical performance and trends of the markets. In the preparation of the FCC broadcasting license appraisals, estimates and assumptions are made that affect the valuation of the intangible asset. These estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future.\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of (1) engineering and programming expenses, (2) selling, general and administrative and (3) corporate expenses.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\n \u2022 Syndication revenue. We receive syndication revenue from licensing various MegaTV content. \nWe repaid the promissory note relating to the acquisition of the Miami studio building on January 3, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 the number of stations, as well as other forms of media, in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups; \nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, our effective tax rate was (489.5)% compared to 111.9% in 2016. The decrease in effective tax rate from 111.9% to (489.5)% is attributed to a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the passage of the Act, change in valuation allowance, and impact of Section 382 ownership change. Exclusive of the impacts from revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the Act, our effective tax rate would have been 198.9%. Our effective tax rate will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income, amount of interest expense disallowance, and the amount of valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates.\nAs noted above under -Dividends on Series B preferred stock classified as interest expense\u201d, we report dividends on the Series B preferred stock as interest expense.\nNet Income\n \u2022 we will use cash flows from operating activities to fund our operations and pay our expenses (including interest on the Notes), but not to repay the Notes or redeem the Series B preferred stock; and \nMarket Revenue Share Projections. Market revenue share projections are based upon the most recent average adjusted audience share for comparable stations operating in each market. This assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to the average competitor, assuming that competitor had similar technical facilities.\nOur television stations and related affiliates operate under the MegaTV\u201d brand. We broadcast via our owned and operated television stations in South Florida, Houston and Puerto Rico and through programming and/or distribution agreements, including nationally on a subscriber basis, which allow us to serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. We have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment, current events and variety with high-quality content. Our programming is formatted to capture a larger share of the U.S. Hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment\u201d company, thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional Hispanic television channels. MegaTV's programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs, ranging from televised radio-branded shows to general entertainment programs, such as music, celebrity, debate, interviews and personality based shows. As part of our strategy, we have incorporated certain of our radio on-air personalities into our television programming. In addition, we have included interactive elements in our programming to complement our Internet websites. We produce over 50 hours of original programming per week. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, our television revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming and generated 11% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of FCC broadcasting licenses. FCC broadcasting licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the Act. The Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if: (i) it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act of 1934 or the FCC's rules and regulations by the licensee; and (iii) there have been no other serious violations, which taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. We intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so. Historically, there has been no material challenge to our license renewals. In addition, the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future.\nNASDAQ Delisting; OTCQX; and OTCQB Venture Market\nOur net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listenership/viewership levels. Each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience. The number of advertisements we decide to broadcast hourly is intended to maximize the station's revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener/viewer levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year.\nOn December 23, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger agreement, dated October 5, 2004, with CBS Radio (formerly known as Infinity Media Corporation, CBS Radio), a division of CBS Corporation, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of San Francisco ( Infinity SF\u201d) and SBS Bay Area, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SBS, pursuant to which SBS acquired the FCC license of Infinity SF (the CBS Radio Merger\u201d), we issued to CBS Radio an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share in exchange for the acquisition of all the rights and obligations of Infinity SF, including the FCC license of Infinity SF for radio station 93.3 FM, serving the San Francisco, California market. The shares of Series C preferred stock issued at the closing of the CBS Radio Merger are convertible into 760,000 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the CBS Radio Merger, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with CBS Radio, pursuant to which CBS Radio may instruct us to file up to three registration statements, on a best efforts basis, with the SEC, providing for the registration for resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C preferred stock.\n \u2022 Corporate expenses. Corporate expenses are related to the operations of our corporate offices and matters. These expenses include compensation and benefits for our corporate employees, professional fees, insurance, corporate facilities expenses and other expenses. \nWe continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes. Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex with the litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d -Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock.\u201d\nlevel of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or aggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, do not include any adjustments that might result if we were unable to do so but, as we have stated under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock,\u201d we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFurther detail regarding some of the items summarized above follows below:\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nCorporate expenses decreased $0.2 million or 2% primarily due to decreases in professional fees and non-cash stock-based compensation offset by increases in compensation and benefits and airline charters to provide humanitarian relief to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nIn addition to conducting our annual impairment testing, at each interim reporting period we performed a qualitative assessment for each unit of accounting for triggering events that could have indicated impairment to our FCC broadcasting licenses. In this assessment, we considered the qualitative factors that are outlined in FASB ASC 350-30-35-18B, which include, but are not limited to, the state of the economy, advertising demand, market conditions, broadcasting industry future growth rates, regulatory matters and technology. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we determined that there were no impairments of our FCC broadcasting licenses as tested for impairment as of November 30, 2017.\n \u2022 Our Notes, of which there are $260.3 million principal amount outstanding, were payable on April 17, 2017. Because we did not have sufficient cash on hand and did not generate sufficient cash from operations, asset sales or the FCC spectrum auction, we did not repay the Notes at their maturity. \nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe increase in gains from the disposal of assets of $15.9 million was primarily related to having recognized gains on the sale of our Los Angeles facility in June 2017 and the relinquishment of one of our Puerto Rico television station's related spectrum in December 2017.\nThe Certificate of Designations entitles the holders of the Series B preferred stock to receive dividends when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors.\nOn August 8, 2016 CBS Radio entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with us, AAA Trust and Mr. Alarc\u00f3n (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to sell and assign its rights related to its 380,000 shares of Series C preferred stock to the AAA Trust for $3.8 million. AAA Trust is a Florida trust, of which Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is the trustee. Mr. Alarc\u00f3n is also the beneficial owner of all the shares of Series C preferred stock held in the AAA Trust. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, CBS Radio agreed to assign the rights under the registration rights agreement and Stockholder Agreement to the AAA Trust, which now holds such registration rights. The parties closed on the Stock Purchase Agreement on August 18, 2016.\nThe decrease in our consolidated net revenues of $9.9 million or 7% was due to decreases in our radio segment offset by increases in our television segment net revenues. Our radio segment net revenues decreased $10.0 million or 8%, due to decreases in local, national and network sales which were offset by increases in special event revenues. Our special events revenue increase occurred primarily in our Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. Our television segment net revenues increased $0.1 million or 1%, due to the receipt of a non-broadcast subscriber based revenue true up payment offset by decreases in local revenues.\nOur valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology. This income approach consists of a quantitative model, which assumes the FCC broadcasting licenses are acquired and operated by a third-party. The valuation method used is based on the premise that the only asset that the unbuilt start-up station would possess is the FCC broadcasting license. The valuation method isolates the income attributable to a FCC broadcasting license by modeling a hypothetical greenfield build-up to a normalized enterprise that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for as part of the build-up process. Consequently, the resulting accretion in value is solely attributed to the FCC broadcasting license.\nInterest Expense, net\nClass B Common Stock\nHolders of the Series B preferred stock have customary protective provisions. The Certificate of Designations contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: (i) pay dividends, purchase junior securities and make restricted investments other restricted payments; (ii) incur indebtedness, including refinancing indebtedness; (iii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and (iv) engage in transactions with affiliates. Upon a change of control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase these shares at a price of 101% of the aggregate liquidation preference of these shares plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding the purchase date.", "item_7_tables": "Table 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

Television segment revenue was flat.\n- Operating income decreased by 4% due to lower revenues and higher expenses.\n- Net loss increased from $16.3 million in 2016 to $19.6 million profit in 2017, primarily due to a large income tax benefit and lower interest expense.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- The company has a severe liquidity strain with high debt levels and preferred stock. It faces doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.\n- The company did not repay $260 million of senior secured notes at maturity in April 2017, resulting in an event of default.\n- There are also issues relating to the Series B preferred stock which the company has also been unable to repay or redeem.\n\nKey Issues\n- The company continues recapitalization and restructuring efforts to address the liquidity situation, debt default and preferred stock issues. However, progress has been hampered by litigation and ownership issues.\n- If unsuccessful in recapitalizing, the company faces substantial doubt about the ability to continue operations."}
