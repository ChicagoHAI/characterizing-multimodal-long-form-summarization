Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) begins with the Company's primary business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of the Company's business. This is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that the Company believes are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the Company's reported financial results. The next section, beginning on page 44, discusses the Company's results of operations for the past two years. Beginning on page 49, the Company provides an analysis of its liquidity and capital resources, including discussions of its cash flows, debt arrangements, sources of capital and financial commitments. Finally, on page 57, the Company discusses funds from operations, or FFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT used by the REIT industry.\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this report. Historical results set forth in Selected Financial Information, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data included in Item 6 and Item 8 and this section should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future operations.\nOverview\nThe Company's principal business activity is the ownership, management and development of income-producing properties. The Company's long-term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate investments.\nThe Company's primary operating strategy is to focus on its community and neighborhood Shopping Center business and its transit-centric, primarily residential mixed-use properties to achieve both cash flow growth and capital appreciation. Management believes there is potential for long term growth in cash flow as existing leases for space in the Shopping Center and Mixed-Use Properties expire and are renewed, or newly available or vacant space is leased. The Company intends to renegotiate leases where possible and seek new tenants for\navailable space in order to optimize the mix of uses to improve foot traffic through the Shopping Centers. As leases expire, management expects to revise rental rates, lease terms and conditions, relocate existing tenants, reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goals of increasing occupancy, improving overall retail sales, and ultimately increasing cash flow as economic conditions improve. In those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring, management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means, or in connection with renovations or relocations, recapturing leases with below market rents and re-leasing at market rates, as well as replacing financially troubled tenants. When possible, management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent, as well as percentage rental provisions, in its leases.\nThe Company's redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties, by replacing below-market-rent leases with strong, traffic-generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores, as well as other desirable local, regional and national tenants. The Company's strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing Shopping Centers, while enhancing this growth with selective acquisitions, redevelopments and renovations.\nIn 2016, the Company completed development of Park Van Ness, a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking, and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room, a wi-fi lounge/business center, and a rooftop pool and deck. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nIn 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased three properties, with approximately 57,400 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate $25.2 million. The three properties are adjacent to an existing property on the east side of Rockville Pike near the Twinbrook Metro station. Combined, the four properties total 10.3 acres and are zoned for up to 1.2 million square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\nThe Company owns properties on the east and west sides of Rockville Pike near the White Flint Metro station which combined total 7.6 acres which are zoned for a development potential of up to 1.6 million square feet of mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\nIn January 2016, the Company terminated a 16,500 square foot lease at 11503 Rockville Pike and received a $3.0 million lease termination fee which was recognized as revenue in the first quarter. The space was previously occupied by an office supply store that had vacated in mid 2014 and the lease was scheduled to expire in 2019. The termination fee revenue was partially offset by the loss of approximately $1.1 million in rental revenue over the remainder of 2016. The Company executed leases with two replacement tenants, whose occupancy and rent commencement occurred in 2017. While the Company continues to plan for a mixed-use development at this site and its neighboring Metro Pike Center, the initial phases of this development are expected to be on the west side of Rockville Pike at Metro Pike Center. The Company has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\nFrom 2014 through 2016, in separate transactions, the Company purchased four adjacent properties on North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia, for an aggregate $54.0 million. The Company is developing approximately 490 residential units and 60,000 square feet of retail space, on 2.8 acres of land. Excavation, sheeting and shoring are substantially complete and construction is proceeding on the first three levels of the below grade parking structure. The development is scheduled for substantial completion in early 2020. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. In 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially finance the project. Leases have been executed for a 41,500 square foot Target and 9,000 square feet of retail shop space, resulting in approximately 84% of the retail space being leased.\nAlbertson's/Safeway, a tenant at eight of the Company's shopping centers, closed two Safeway stores located at the Company's properties during the June 2016 quarter. The stores that closed were located in Broadlands Village, Loudoun County, Virginia and Briggs Chaney Plaza, Montgomery County, Maryland. The lease at Briggs Chaney remains in full force and effect and Albertson's/Safeway has executed a sublease with a replacement grocer, Global Foods, for that space, which commenced operations in March 2017. The Company terminated the lease with Albertson's/Safeway at Broadlands and has executed a lease with Aldi Food Market for 20,000 square feet of this space which opened in November 2017. We continue to actively market the balance of the former Safeway space.\nIn January 2017, the Company purchased for $76.4 million, including acquisition costs, Burtonsville Town Square, a 121,000 square foot shopping center located in Burtonsville, Maryland. Burtonsville Town Square is 100% leased and anchored by Giant Food and CVS Pharmacy. The purchase was funded with a new $40.0 million mortgage loan and through the Company's credit line facility. The Company expects to begin construction on a 16,000 square foot small shop expansion in the Spring of 2018, with delivery projected in late 2018. The total development cost is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. Lease negotiations are in progress for over 50% of the space.\nIn light of the limited amount of quality properties for sale and the escalated pricing of properties that the Company has been presented with or has inquired about over the past year, management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new Shopping Center and Mixed-Use Properties in the near future is uncertain. Because of its conservative capital structure, including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility, management believes that the Company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are identified and market conditions improve. (See Item 1. Business - Capital Policies\u201d). It is management's view that several of the sub-markets in which the Company operates have, or are expected to have in the future, attractive supply/demand characteristics. The Company will continue to evaluate acquisition, development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan.\nThe recent period of economic expansion has now run in excess of five years. While economic conditions within the local Washington, DC metropolitan area have remained relatively stable, issues facing the Federal government relating to taxation, spending and interest rate policy will likely impact the office, retail and residential real estate markets over the coming years. Because the majority of the Company's property operating income is produced by our shopping centers, we continually monitor the implications of government policy changes, as well as shifts in consumer demand between on-line and in-store shopping, on future shopping center construction and retailer store expansion plans. Based on our observations, we continue to adapt our marketing and merchandising strategies in a way to maximize our future performance. The Company's commercial leasing percentage, on a comparable property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, declined to 94.2% at December 31, 2017, from 95.5% at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50%, which allows the Company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary. As of December 31, 2017, amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2019 to 2035 represented approximately 92.2% of the Company's notes payable, thus minimizing refinancing risk. The Company's variable-rate debt consists of a $14.1 million bank term loan secured by the Metro Pike Center, which was repaid in full in January 2018, and $61.0 million outstanding under the unsecured revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has loan availability of approximately $213.8 million under its $275.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit.\nThe Operating Partnership entered into a Credit Agreement dated January 26, 2018, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Capital One, National Association, as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Capital One, National Association, as Joint Lead Arrangers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Capital One, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, TD Bank, N.A., Regions Bank and Associated Bank, National Association, as Lenders (the New Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe New Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement dated June 24, 2014, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Capital One, N.A. and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania as Lenders (as amended, the Original Agreement\u201d). The Original Agreement consisted of a $275,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the Original Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 23, 2018 and bore interest at a variable rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 145 basis points to 200 basis points, as determined by certain leverage tests. As of the date the Original Facility was replaced, the applicable spread was 1.45%.\nThe New Credit Agreement consists of a $400,000,000 credit facility (the New Facility\u201d), of which $325,000,000 is a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Line\u201d) and $75,000,000 is a term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended.\nIn general, loan availability under the New Facility is primarily determined by operating income from the Company's existing unencumbered properties. Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the Revolving Line, and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the Term Loan, each as determined by certain leverage tests. As of January 26, 2018, the applicable spread for borrowings is 135 basis points under the Revolving Line and 130 basis points under the Term Loan.\nThe Company and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company have guaranteed the payment obligations of the Partnership under the New Facility.\nAlthough it is management's present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and office properties in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Company may, in the future, also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves. While the Company may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, the Company does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of Company assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of financial position and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The Company has identified the following policies that, due to estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, involve a relatively high degree of judgment and complexity.\nReal Estate Investments\nReal estate investment properties are stated at historic cost less depreciation. Although the Company intends to own its real estate investment properties over a long term, from time to time it will evaluate its market position, market conditions, and other factors and may elect to sell properties that do not conform to the Company's investment profile. Management believes that the Company's real estate assets have generally appreciated in value since their acquisition or development and, accordingly, the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the Company's liabilities as reported in the financial statements. Because the financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, they do not report the current value of the Company's real estate investment properties.\nThe Company purchases real estate investment properties from time to time and records assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases and customer relationships based on their relative fair values. The fair value of buildings generally is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates and considers the present\nvalue of all cash flows expected to be generated by the property including an initial lease up period. The Company determines the fair value of above and below market intangibles associated with in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the in-place lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition taking into consideration the remaining contractual lease period, renewal periods, and the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options. The fair value of a below market lease component is recorded as deferred income and accreted as additional lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease period. If the fair value of the below market lease intangible includes fair value associated with a renewal option, such amounts are not accreted until the renewal option is exercised. If the renewal option is not exercised the value is recognized at that time. The fair value of above market lease intangibles is recorded as a deferred asset and is amortized as a reduction of lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease term. The Company determines the fair value of at-market in-place leases considering the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period and carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. Intangible assets associated with at-market in-place leases are amortized as additional expense over the remaining contractual lease term. To the extent customer relationship intangibles are present in an acquisition, the fair value of the intangibles are amortized over the life of the customer relationship. From time to time the Company may purchase a property for future development purposes. The property may be improved with an existing structure that would be demolished as part of the development. In such cases, the fair value of the building may be determined based only on existing leases and not include estimated cash flows related to future leases. Acquisition-related transaction costs are either (a) expensed as incurred when related to business combinations or (b) capitalized to land and/or building when related to asset acquisitions.\nIf there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a potential impairment in the value of a real estate investment property, the Company prepares an analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the real estate investment property exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in identifying impairment indicators including recurring operating losses, significant decreases in occupancy, and significant adverse changes in legal factors and business climate. If impairment indicators are present, the Company compares the projected cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of that property. The Company assesses its undiscounted projected cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates, historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted projected cash flows, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its then estimated fair value. The fair value of any property is sensitive to the actual results of any of the aforementioned estimated factors, either individually or taken as a whole. Should the actual results differ from management's projections, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.\nWhen incurred, the Company capitalizes the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment. All repair and maintenance expenditures are expensed when incurred. Leasehold improvements expenditures are capitalized when certain criteria are met, including when we supervise construction and will own the improvement. Tenant improvements we own are depreciated over the life of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nInterest, real estate taxes, development-related salary costs and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction. Upon substantial completion of construction, the assets are placed in service, rental income, direct operating expenses, and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations. Commercial development projects are substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity. Residential development projects are considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon receipt of the certificate of occupancy from the appropriate licensing authority. Substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives of generally between 35 and 50 years for base buildings, or a shorter period if management determines that the building has a shorter useful life, and up to 20 years for certain other improvements.\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nCertain initial direct costs incurred by the Company in negotiating and consummating successful commercial leases are capitalized and amortized over the term of the leases. Deferred leasing costs consist of\ncommissions paid to third-party leasing agents as well as internal direct costs such as employee compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing successful leasing-related activities. Such activities include evaluating prospective tenants' financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating lease terms, preparing lease documents and closing transactions. In addition, deferred leasing costs include amounts attributed to in-place leases associated with acquisition properties.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental and interest income are accrued as earned. Recognition of rental income commences when control of the space has been given to the tenant. When rental payments due under leases vary from a straight-line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases, income is recognized on a straight-line basis throughout the term of the lease. Expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to tenants, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs. Expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred. Rental income based on a tenant's revenue, known as percentage rent, is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint specified in the lease agreement.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - Current and Deferred Receivables\nAccounts receivable primarily represent amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the terms of the respective leases, subject to the Company's revenue recognition policy. Receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established with a charge to current period operations when, in the opinion of management, collection of the receivable is doubtful. In addition to rents due currently, accounts receivable include amounts representing minimum rental income accrued on a straight-line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases. Reserves are established with a charge to income for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant's ability to perform under its lease obligations.\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, which are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes the final outcome of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or the results of operations. Upon determination that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine.\nResults of Operations\nSame property revenue and same property operating income are non-GAAP financial measures of performance and improve the comparability of these measures by excluding the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods.\nWe define same property revenue as total revenue minus the sum of interest income and revenue of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods, and we define same property operating income as net income plus the sum of interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expense, loss on the early extinguishment of debt (if any), predevelopment expense and acquisition related costs, minus the sum of interest income, the change in the fair value of derivatives, gains on property dispositions (if any) and the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods.\nOther REITs may use different methodologies for calculating same property revenue and same property operating income. Accordingly, our same property revenue and same property operating income may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\nSame property revenue and same property operating income are used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of our properties, and to determine trends in earnings, because these measures are not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to ownership of our properties. We believe the exclusion of these items from revenue and operating income is useful because the resulting measures capture the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred by operating our properties.\nSame property revenue and same property operating income are measures of the operating performance of our properties but do not measure our performance as a whole. Such measures are therefore not substitutes for total revenue, net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below provide reconciliations of total revenue and operating income under GAAP to same property revenue and operating income for the indicated periods. The same property results include 48 Shopping Centers and five Mixed-Use properties for each period.\nSame property revenue\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

includes $0.5 million, $1.8 million and $2.4 million, for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, to recognize base rent on a straight-line basis. In addition, base rent includes $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $1.8 million, for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, to recognize income from the amortization of in-place leases.\nTotal revenue increased 4.7% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) an $0.84 per square foot increase in base rent ($7.3 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) higher residential base rent ($4.8 million), (c) higher expense\nrecoveries ($1.1 million), and (d) the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($0.1 million) partially offset by (e) a 144,327 square foot decrease in leased space ($2.7 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike and (f) lower other income ($0.3 million), exclusive of the termination fees at 11503 Rockville Pike and Broadlands. Total revenue increased 3.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) a $0.32 per square foot increase in base rent ($2.8 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) higher residential base rent ($2.3 million), (c) the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($1.9 million), and (d) higher expense recoveries ($1.4 million) partially offset by (e) a 4,185 square foot decrease in leased space ($0.1 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike. A discussion of the components of revenue follows.\nBase rent\nThe $8.8 million increase in base rent in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to (a) a $0.78 per square foot increase in base rent ($6.8 million) and (b) higher residential base rent ($4.8 million) partially offset by (c) a 144,327 square foot decrease in leased space ($2.7 million). The $4.1 million increase in base rent in 2016 compared to 2015 was attributable to (a) a $0.21 per square foot increase in base rent ($1.8 million) and (b) higher residential base rent ($2.3 million) partially offset by (c) a 4,185 square foot decrease in leased space ($0.1 million).\nExpense recoveries\nExpense recovery income increased $1.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher real estate tax expense. Expense recovery income increased $1.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher real estate tax expense.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased $0.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Other revenue increased $2.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a $3.0 million lease termination fee at 11503 Rockville Pike.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 from\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 from\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes\n</td> <td>26,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\n</td> <td>47,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of deferred leasing costs\n</td> <td>45,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>18,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predevelopment expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased 3.3% in 2017 compared to 2016.

Property operating expenses increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nProvision for credit losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the Company's estimate of amounts owed by tenants that may not be collectible and was 0.40%, 0.69%, and 0.44% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 relates primarily to a single shopping center tenant.\nReal estate taxes\nReal estate taxes increased $2.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.7 million), (b) Burtonsville Town Square ($0.4 million) and (c) small increases at various properties throughout the portfolio. Real estate taxes increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.3 million) and (b) small increases throughout the remainder of the portfolio.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs increased by $1.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Burtonsville Town Square ($2.2 million) and (b) Park Van Ness ($0.7 million) partially offset by (c) higher capitalized interest ($1.0 million) and (d) lower average balances of mortgage debt throughout the portfolio ($0.4 million).\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization of deferred leasing costs increased by $1.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Burtonsville Town Square ($1.4 million) and (b) Park Van Ness ($1.2 million) partially offset by (c) lower expense at North Glebe Road ($0.9 million) and (d) lower expense at 1500 Rockville Pike ($0.3 million). Depreciation and amortization of deferred leasing costs increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($1.8 million) partially offset by (b) lower expense at Germantown ($0.7 million).\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs increased $0.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) increased salary and benefit expense ($0.6 million). General and administrative costs increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) increased salary and benefit expense ($1.0 million) and (b) increased stock option expense ($0.2 million).\nAcquisition related costs\nAcquisition related costs in 2016 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of a retail pad site adjacent to the Company's existing Thruway Shopping Center. Acquisition related costs in 2015 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of 726 N. Glebe Road.\nPredevelopment expenses\nPredevelopment expenses include lease termination costs and demolition costs which are related to development projects and do not meet the criteria to be capitalized.\nGain on Sales of Properties\nGain on sale of property in 2016 resulted from the December 2016 sale of Crosstown Business Center.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has remained relatively low during 2017 and 2016. The impact of rising operating expenses due to inflation on the operating performance of the Company's portfolio would have been mitigated by terms in substantially all of the Company's leases which contain provisions designed to increase revenues to offset the adverse impact of inflation on the Company's results of operations. These provisions include upward periodic\nadjustments in base rent due from tenants, usually based on a stipulated increase and to a lesser extent on a factor of the change in the consumer price index, commonly referred to as the CPI.\nIn addition, substantially all of the Company's properties are leased to tenants under long-term leases, which provide for reimbursement of operating expenses by tenants. These leases tend to reduce the Company's exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the Company's tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in their revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $10.9 million and $8.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The changes in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were attributable to operating, investing and financing activities, as described below.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(113,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>12,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,681\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $14.4 million to $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities represents, in each year, cash received primarily from rental income, plus other income, less property operating expenses, normal recurring general and administrative expenses and interest payments on debt outstanding.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $27.0 million to $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Investing activities in 2017 primarily reflect tenant improvements and capital expenditures ($17.7 million), the Company's development activities ($22.8 million) and the acquisition of various retail real estate assets ($79.5 million). Net cash used in investing activities increased $16.7 million to $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income,\u201d as defined in the Code. The Company expects to meet these short-term liquidity requirements (other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions and developments) through cash provided from operations, available cash and its existing line of credit.\nLong-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt and dividends paid to our preferred shareholders. We anticipate that long-term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for property acquisitions and developments. The Company is developing a primarily residential project with street-level retail at 750 N. Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. The Company had invested $83.5 million as of December 31, 2017, and expects to invest approximately $34.5 million during 2018, which will be funded by the revolving credit facility. The remaining cost will be funded by a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, which closed in 2017. The Company may also redevelop certain of the Current Portfolio Properties and may develop additional freestanding outparcels or expansions within certain of the Shopping Centers.\nAcquisition and development of properties are undertaken only after careful analysis and review, and management's determination that such properties are expected to provide long-term earnings and cash flow growth. During the coming year, developments, expansions or acquisitions are expected to be funded with available cash,\nbank borrowings from the Company's credit line, construction and permanent financing, proceeds from the operation of the Company's dividend reinvestment plan or other external debt or equity capital resources available to the Company. Any future borrowings may be at the Saul Centers, Operating Partnership or Subsidiary Partnership level, and securities offerings may include (subject to certain limitations) the issuance of additional limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership which can be converted into shares of Saul Centers common stock. The availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had unfunded contractual payment obligations of approximately $228.8 million, excluding operating obligations, due within the next 12 months. The table below shows the total contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>One Year or\nLess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes Payable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scheduled Principal\n</td> <td>30,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balloon Payments\n</td> <td>75,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>151,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>711,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,287,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Headquarters Lease (1)\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development Obligations\n</td> <td>70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant Improvements\n</td> <td>6,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,452,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The depositary shares pay an annual dividend of $1.53125 per share, equivalent to 6.125% of the $25.00 liquidation preference. The Series D preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any other securities of the Company except in connection with certain changes in control or delisting events. Investors in the depositary shares generally have no voting rights, but will have limited voting rights if the Company fails to pay dividends for six or more quarters (whether or not declared or consecutive) and in certain other events. On February 22, 2018, the proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem 3.0 million depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of the Company's 6.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nDividend Reinvestments\nIn December 1995, the Company established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan\u201d) to allow its common stockholders and holders of limited partnership interests an opportunity to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their dividends or distributions. The Plan provides for investing in newly issued shares of common stock at a 3% discount from market price without payment of any brokerage commissions, service charges or other expenses. All expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company. The Company issued 258,759 and 178,787 shares under the Plan at a weighted average discounted price of $59.20 and $55.19 per share during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company issued 111,351 and 124,758 limited partnership units under the Plan at a weighted average price of $60.48 and $55.39 per unit during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, respectively. The Company also credited 7,252 and 8,010 shares to directors pursuant to the reinvestment of dividends specified by the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan at a weighted average discounted price of $59.70 and $55.42 per share, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCapital Strategy and Financing Activity\nAs a general policy, the Company intends to maintain a ratio of its total debt to total asset value of 50% or less and to actively manage the Company's leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges. Asset value is the aggregate fair market value of the Current Portfolio Properties and any subsequently acquired properties as reasonably determined by management by reference to the properties' aggregate cash flow. Given the Company's current debt level, it is management's belief that the ratio of the Company's debt to total asset value was below 50% as of December 31, 2017.\nThe organizational documents of the Company do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that it may incur. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, reevaluate the Company's debt capitalization policy in light of current economic conditions, relative costs of capital, market values of the Company property portfolio, opportunities for acquisition, development or expansion, and such other factors as the Board of Directors then deems relevant. The Board of Directors may modify the Company's debt capitalization policy based on such a reevaluation without shareholder approval and consequently, may increase or decrease the Company's debt to total asset ratio above or below 50% or may waive the policy for certain periods of time. The Company selectively continues to refinance or renegotiate the terms of its outstanding debt in order to achieve longer maturities, and obtain generally more favorable loan terms, whenever management determines the financing environment is favorable.\nThe following is a summary of notes payable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

The new credit facility, which can be used for working capital, property acquisitions, development projects or letters of credit, totals $400,000,000 (the New Facility\u201d), of which $325,000,000 is a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Line\u201d) and $75,000,000 is a term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended. In general, loan availability under the New Facility is primarily determined by operating income from the Company's existing unencumbered properties. Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the Revolving Line, and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the Term Loan, each as determined by certain leverage tests. As of January 26, 2018, the applicable spread for borrowings is 135 basis points under the Revolving Line and 130 basis points under the Term Loan.

FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding extraordinary items, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from property dispositions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, which is disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time (i.e. depreciation), which is contrary to what we believe occurs with our assets, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs.\nAcquisitions, Redevelopments and Renovations\nManagement anticipates that during the coming year the Company will continue activities related to the redevelopment of 750 N. Glebe Road and may develop additional freestanding outparcels or expansions within certain of the Shopping Centers. Although not currently planned, it is possible that the Company may redevelop additional Current Portfolio Properties and may develop expansions within certain of the Shopping Centers. Acquisition and development of properties are undertaken only after careful analysis and review, and management's determination that such properties are expected to provide long-term earnings and cash flow growth. During the coming year, any developments, expansions or acquisitions are expected to be funded with borrowings from the Company's credit line, construction financing, proceeds from the operation of the Company's dividend reinvestment plan or other external capital resources available to the Company.\nThe Company has been selectively involved in acquisition, development, redevelopment and renovation activities. It continues to evaluate the acquisition of land parcels for retail and office development and acquisitions of operating properties for opportunities to enhance operating income and cash flow growth. The following describes significant acquisitions, developments, redevelopments and renovations which affected the Company's financial position and results of operations in 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nWestview Pad\nIn February 2015, the Company purchased for $0.9 million, including acquisition costs, a 1.1 acre retail pad site in Frederick, Maryland, which is contiguous with and an expansion of the Company's other Westview asset.\n700, 726, 730, 750 N.

Excavation, sheeting and shoring are substantially complete and construction is proceeding on the first three levels of the below grade parking structure. The development is scheduled for substantial completion in early 2020. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. In 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially finance the project. The Company has executed a 41,500 square foot anchor-lease with Target and leases for an aggregate of 9,000 square feet of retail shop space, resulting in approximately 84% of the retail space being leased.\nPark Van Ness\nIn 2016, the Company completed development of Park Van Ness, a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking, and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room, a wi-fi lounge/business center, and a rooftop pool and deck. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nThruway Pad\nIn August 2016, the Company purchased for $3.1 million, a retail pad site with an occupied 4,200 square foot bank building in Winston Salem, North Carolina, and incurred acquisition costs of $60,400.

The land is zoned for up to 115,000 square feet of retail development. In order to allow the Company time to pre-lease and complete project plans and specifications, the parties have agreed to a closing date in the second quarter of 2018, at which time the Company will exchange limited partnership units for the land. The number of limited partnership units to be exchanged will be based on the initial purchase price and the average share value (as defined in the agreement) of the Company's common stock at the time of the exchange. The Company intends to construct a shopping center and, upon stabilization, may be obligated to issue additional limited partnership units to the Trust.\nBeacon Center\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company purchased for $22.7 million, including acquisition costs, the land underlying Beacon Center. The land was previously leased by the Company with an annual rent of approximately $60,000. The purchase price was funded in part by an $11.25 million increase to the existing mortgage collateralized by Beacon Center and in part by the Company's revolving credit facility.\nSouthdale\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company purchased for $15.3 million, including acquisition costs, the land underlying Southdale. The land was previously leased by the Company with an annual rent of approximately $60,000. The purchase price was funded by the Company's revolving credit facility.\nBurtonsville Town Square\nIn January 2017, the Company purchased for $76.4 million, including acquisition costs, Burtonsville Town Square, a 121,000 square foot shopping center located in Burtonsville, Maryland. Burtonsville Town Square is 100% leased and anchored by Giant Food and CVS Pharmacy. The purchase was funded with a new $40.0 million mortgage loan and through the Company's credit line facility. The mortgage bears interest at 3.39%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $197,900 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule, and has a 15-year maturity. The Company expects to begin construction on a 16,000 square foot small shop expansion in the Spring of 2018, with delivery projected in late 2018. The total development cost is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. Lease negotiations are in progress for over 50% of the space.\nOlney Shopping Center\nIn March 2017, the Company purchased for $3.1 million, including acquisition costs, the land underlying Olney Shopping Center. The land was previously leased by the Company with an annual rent of approximately $56,000. The purchase price was funded by the revolving credit facility.\n7316 Wisconsin Avenue\nOn January 12, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase for $35.5 million, plus approximately $0.7 million of acquisition costs, a 69,600 square foot office building and the underlying ground located at 7316 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland and has an earnest money deposit of $3.5 million at risk. The property has mixed-use development potential of up to 325 apartment units and approximately 10,000 square feet of street level retail pursuant to the recently approved Bethesda Downtown Plan. The purchase price will be funded through the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company anticipates closing the acquisition on or before January 12, 2019.\nProperty Sales\nCrosstown Business Center\nIn December 2016, the Company sold for $5.4 million the 197,100 square foot Crosstown Business Center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and recognized a $1.0 million gain.\nGreat Eastern Shopping Center\nIn September 2017, the Company sold for $8.5 million the 255,400 square foot Great Eastern Shopping Center located in District Heights, Maryland. The Company provided $1.28 million second trust financing to the buyer, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 6%, matures in March 2018 and can be extended for six months at the option of the buyer. A $0.5 million gain realized on the sale was deferred and will be recognized when the loan is repaid by the buyer.\nPortfolio Leasing Status\nThe following chart sets forth certain information regarding commercial leases at our properties for the periods indicated.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Square Footage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Leased\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shopping\nCenters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mixed-Use\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shopping\nCenters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mixed-Use\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Shopping\nCenters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mixed-Use\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,750,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,076,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,882,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,076,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,896,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,264,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe residential components of Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness were 96.7% and 95.9% leased, respectively, at December 31, 2017.

The information is based on executed leases without adjustment for the timing of occupancy, tenant defaults, or landlord concessions. The base rent for an expiring lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expiration date of the lease. The base rent for a new or renewed lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expected rent commencement date. Because tenants that execute leases may not ultimately take possession of their space or pay all of their contractual rent, the changes presented in the table provide information only about trends in market rental rates. The actual changes in rental income received by the Company may be different.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Rent per Square Foot\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number\nof Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New/Renewed\nLeases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiring\nLeases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,315,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,292,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,583,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional information about commercial leasing activity during the three months ended December 31, 2017, is set forth below.

FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding extraordinary items, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from property dispositions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, which is disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time (i.e. depreciation), which is contrary to what we believe occurs with our assets, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(113,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>12,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,681\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses and capital expenditures, debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt), distributions to common and preferred stockholders, distributions to unit holders and amounts required for expansion and renovation of the Current Portfolio Properties and selective acquisition and development of additional properties. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income,\u201d as defined in the Code. The Company expects to meet these short-term liquidity requirements (other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions and developments) through cash provided from operations, available cash and its existing line of credit.\n25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $15.5 million at maturity. Proceeds of the loan were used to repay in full the existing 7.45% mortgage in the amount of $15.2 million, which was scheduled to mature in June 2015 and to pay down outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility.\n\n (s) The loan is collateralized by Avenel Business Park and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $246,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.9 million at loan maturity. Principal of $830,000 was amortized during 2017. \nSame property revenue and same property operating income are used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of our properties, and to determine trends in earnings, because these measures are not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to ownership of our properties. We believe the exclusion of these items from revenue and operating income is useful because the resulting measures capture the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred by operating our properties.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of financial position and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The Company has identified the following policies that, due to estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, involve a relatively high degree of judgment and complexity.\nThe New Credit Agreement consists of a $400,000,000 credit facility (the New Facility\u201d), of which $325,000,000 is a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Line\u201d) and $75,000,000 is a term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended.\n (j) The loan is collateralized by Jamestown Place and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $66,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $6.1 million at loan maturity. Principal of $360,000 was amortized during 2017. \nIn January 2016, the Company terminated a 16,500 square foot lease at 11503 Rockville Pike and received a $3.0 million lease termination fee which was recognized as revenue in the first quarter. The space was previously occupied by an office supply store that had vacated in mid 2014 and the lease was scheduled to expire in 2019. The termination fee revenue was partially offset by the loss of approximately $1.1 million in rental revenue over the remainder of 2016. The Company executed leases with two replacement tenants, whose occupancy and rent commencement occurred in 2017. While the Company continues to plan for a mixed-use development at this site and its neighboring Metro Pike Center, the initial phases of this development are expected to be on the west side of Rockville Pike at Metro Pike Center. The Company has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Recognition of rental income commences when control of the space has been given to the tenant. When rental payments due under leases vary from a straight-line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases, income is recognized on a straight-line basis throughout the term of the lease. Expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to tenants, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs. Expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred. Rental income based on a tenant's revenue, known as percentage rent, is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint specified in the lease agreement.\nTable 173:

The Company determines the fair value of above and below market intangibles associated with in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the in-place lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition taking into consideration the remaining contractual lease period, renewal periods, and the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options. The fair value of a below market lease component is recorded as deferred income and accreted as additional lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease period. If the fair value of the below market lease intangible includes fair value associated with a renewal option, such amounts are not accreted until the renewal option is exercised. If the renewal option is not exercised the value is recognized at that time. The fair value of above market lease intangibles is recorded as a deferred asset and is amortized as a reduction of lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease term. The Company determines the fair value of at-market in-place leases considering the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period and carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. Intangible assets associated with at-market in-place leases are amortized as additional expense over the remaining contractual lease term. To the extent customer relationship intangibles are present in an acquisition, the fair value of the intangibles are amortized over the life of the customer relationship. From time to time the Company may purchase a property for future development purposes. The property may be improved with an existing structure that would be demolished as part of the development. In such cases, the fair value of the building may be determined based only on existing leases and not include estimated cash flows related to future leases.

The Company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in identifying impairment indicators including recurring operating losses, significant decreases in occupancy, and significant adverse changes in legal factors and business climate. If impairment indicators are present, the Company compares the projected cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of that property. The Company assesses its undiscounted projected cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates, historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted projected cash flows, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its then estimated fair value. The fair value of any property is sensitive to the actual results of any of the aforementioned estimated factors, either individually or taken as a whole. Should the actual results differ from management's projections, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.\n (ii) The Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with its Olney property and is accounting for that transaction as a secured financing. The arrangement requires monthly payments of $60,400 which increase by 1.5% on May 1, 2015, and every May 1 thereafter.

The next section, beginning on page 44, discusses the Company's results of operations for the past two years. Beginning on page 49, the Company provides an analysis of its liquidity and capital resources, including discussions of its cash flows, debt arrangements, sources of capital and financial commitments.

The information is based on executed leases without adjustment for the timing of occupancy, tenant defaults, or landlord concessions. The base rent for an expiring lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expiration date of the lease. The base rent for a new or renewed lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expected rent commencement date. Because tenants that execute leases may not ultimately take possession of their space or pay all of their contractual rent, the changes presented in the table provide information only about trends in market rental rates.

The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended. In general, loan availability under the New Facility is primarily determined by operating income from the Company's existing unencumbered properties. Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the Revolving Line, and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the Term Loan, each as determined by certain leverage tests. As of January 26, 2018, the applicable spread for borrowings is 135 basis points under the Revolving Line and 130 basis points under the Term Loan.

Saul Real Estate Investment Trust (the Trust\u201d), for an initial purchase price of $8.8 million, approximately 14.3 acres of land located at the intersection of Ashburn Village Boulevard and Russell Branch Parkway in Loudoun County, Virginia. The land is zoned for up to 115,000 square feet of retail development. In order to allow the Company time to pre-lease and complete project plans and specifications, the parties have agreed to a closing date in the second quarter of 2018, at which time the Company will exchange limited partnership units for the land. The number of limited partnership units to be exchanged will be based on the initial purchase price and the average share value (as defined in the agreement) of the Company's common stock at the time of the exchange. The Company intends to construct a shopping center and, upon stabilization, may be obligated to issue additional limited partnership units to the Trust.\nEffective September 1, 2017, the Company's $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan, which is fully drawn and secured by Park Van Ness, converted to permanent financing. The loan matures in 2032, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.88%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $413,500 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $39.6 million at maturity.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs increased by $1.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Burtonsville Town Square ($2.2 million) and (b) Park Van Ness ($0.7 million) partially offset by (c) higher capitalized interest ($1.0 million) and (d) lower average balances of mortgage debt throughout the portfolio ($0.4 million).\n\ncommissions paid to third-party leasing agents as well as internal direct costs such as employee compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing successful leasing-related activities.

In addition, deferred leasing costs include amounts attributed to in-place leases associated with acquisition properties.\nends to but not including the redemption date. The depositary shares pay an annual dividend of $1.53125 per share, equivalent to 6.125% of the $25.00 liquidation preference. The Series D preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any other securities of the Company except in connection with certain changes in control or delisting events. Investors in the depositary shares generally have no voting rights, but will have limited voting rights if the Company fails to pay dividends for six or more quarters (whether or not declared or consecutive) and in certain other events. On February 22, 2018, the proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem 3.0 million depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of the Company's 6.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nWestview Pad\nThe following is a summary of notes payable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n (jj) The loan is a $275.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Interest accrues at a rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 145 basis points. The line may be extended at the Company's option for one year with payment of a fee of 0.15%. Monthly payments, if required, are interest only and vary depending upon the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate for any given month. \nProvision for credit losses\nIn August 2016, the Company purchased for $3.1 million, a retail pad site with an occupied 4,200 square foot bank building in Winston Salem, North Carolina, and incurred acquisition costs of $60,400. The property is contiguous with and an expansion of the Company's Thruway Shopping Center.\navailable space in order to optimize the mix of uses to improve foot traffic through the Shopping Centers. As leases expire, management expects to revise rental rates, lease terms and conditions, relocate existing tenants, reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goals of increasing occupancy, improving overall retail sales, and ultimately increasing cash flow as economic conditions improve. In those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring, management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means, or in connection with renovations or relocations, recapturing leases with below market rents and re-leasing at market rates, as well as replacing financially troubled tenants. When possible, management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent, as well as percentage rental provisions, in its leases.\nThe provision for credit losses represents the Company's estimate of amounts owed by tenants that may not be collectible and was 0.40%, 0.69%, and 0.44% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 relates primarily to a single shopping center tenant.\nInvesting Activities\n (cc) The loan is collateralized by Seabreeze Plaza and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $94,900 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $9.5 million at loan maturity. Principal of $488,000 was amortized in 2017. \nFunds From Operations\n2017 Financing Activity\nInflation has remained relatively low during 2017 and 2016. The impact of rising operating expenses due to inflation on the operating performance of the Company's portfolio would have been mitigated by terms in substantially all of the Company's leases which contain provisions designed to increase revenues to offset the adverse impact of inflation on the Company's results of operations. These provisions include upward periodic\nOn January 18, 2017, the Company closed on a 15-year, non-recourse $40.0 million mortgage loan secured by Burtonsville Town Square. The loan matures in 2032, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.39%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $197,900 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $20.3 million million at maturity.\nLong-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt and dividends paid to our preferred shareholders. We anticipate that long-term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for property acquisitions and developments. The Company is developing a primarily residential project with street-level retail at 750 N. Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. The Company had invested $83.5 million as of December 31, 2017, and expects to invest approximately $34.5 million during 2018, which will be funded by the revolving credit facility. The remaining cost will be funded by a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, which closed in 2017. The Company may also redevelop certain of the Current Portfolio Properties and may develop additional freestanding outparcels or expansions within certain of the Shopping Centers.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects:\nTotal revenue increased 4.7% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) an $0.84 per square foot increase in base rent ($7.3 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) higher residential base rent ($4.8 million), (c) higher expense\nIn September 2017, the Company sold for $8.5 million the 255,400 square foot Great Eastern Shopping Center located in District Heights, Maryland. The Company provided $1.28 million second trust financing to the buyer, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 6%, matures in March 2018 and can be extended for six months at the option of the buyer. A $0.5 million gain realized on the sale was deferred and will be recognized when the loan is repaid by the buyer.\n \u2022 proceeds of $24.9 million from construction loan draws.  Liquidity Requirements\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $27.0 million to $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Investing activities in 2017 primarily reflect tenant improvements and capital expenditures ($17.7 million), the Company's development activities ($22.8 million) and the acquisition of various retail real estate assets ($79.5 million). Net cash used in investing activities increased $16.7 million to $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Investing activities in 2016 primarily reflect (a) tenant improvements and capital expenditures ($15.6 million), (b) the Company's development activities ($27.2 million) and (c) the acquisition of various retail real estate assets ($48.3 million).\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company owns properties on the east and west sides of Rockville Pike near the White Flint Metro station which combined total 7.6 acres which are zoned for a development potential of up to 1.6 million square feet of mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\n \u2022 limit the amount of debt so that interest coverage will exceed 2.0x on a trailing four-quarter basis (interest expense coverage); and \nTotal operating expenses increased 3.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. Total operating expenses increased 3.3% in 2016 compared to 2015.\n \u2022 distributions to common stockholders totaling $44.6 million; \nFrom 2014 through 2016, in separate transactions, the Company purchased four adjacent properties on North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia, for an aggregate $54.0 million. The Company is developing approximately 490 residential units and 60,000 square feet of retail space, on 2.8 acres of land. Excavation, sheeting and shoring are substantially complete and construction is proceeding on the first three levels of the below grade parking structure. The development is scheduled for substantial completion in early 2020. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. In 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially finance the project. Leases have been executed for a 41,500 square foot Target and 9,000 square feet of retail shop space, resulting in approximately 84% of the retail space being leased.\nIn 2016, the Company completed development of Park Van Ness, a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking, and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room, a wi-fi lounge/business center, and a rooftop pool and deck. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral and administrative\nResults of Operations\nThe Company has been selectively involved in acquisition, development, redevelopment and renovation activities. It continues to evaluate the acquisition of land parcels for retail and office development and acquisitions of operating properties for opportunities to enhance operating income and cash flow growth. The following describes significant acquisitions, developments, redevelopments and renovations which affected the Company's financial position and results of operations in 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\n (o) The loan is collateralized by Great Falls shopping center. The loan consists of three notes which require equal monthly principal and interest payments of $138,000 based upon a weighted average 26-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $6.3 million at maturity. Principal of $824,000 was amortized during 2017. \nSame property revenue and same property operating income are measures of the operating performance of our properties but do not measure our performance as a whole. Such measures are therefore not substitutes for total revenue, net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\n \u2022 the repayment of mortgage notes payable totaling $24.7 million; \n\n \u2022 distributions made to preferred stockholders totaling $12.4 million; and \n (c) The loan is collateralized by Olde Forte Village and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $98,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $9.0 million at loan maturity. Principal of $589,000 was amortized during 2017. \nAs a general policy, the Company intends to maintain a ratio of its total debt to total asset value of 50% or less and to actively manage the Company's leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges. Asset value is the aggregate fair market value of the Current Portfolio Properties and any subsequently acquired properties as reasonably determined by management by reference to the properties' aggregate cash flow. Given the Company's current debt level, it is management's belief that the ratio of the Company's debt to total asset value was below 50% as of December 31, 2017.\n(ff) The loan is collateralized by Burtonsville Town Square and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $198,000 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.3 million at loan maturity. Principal of $860,000 was amortized in 2017.\n \u2022 limit the amount of debt as a percentage of gross asset value, as defined in the loan agreement, to less than 60% (leverage ratio); \n (f) The loan is collateralized by Shops at Monocacy and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $112,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $10.6 million at loan maturity. Principal of $696,000 was amortized during 2017. \nInterest, real estate taxes, development-related salary costs and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction. Upon substantial completion of construction, the assets are placed in service, rental income, direct operating expenses, and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations. Commercial development projects are substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity. Residential development projects are considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon receipt of the certificate of occupancy from the appropriate licensing authority. Substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives of generally between 35 and 50 years for base buildings, or a shorter period if management determines that the building has a shorter useful life, and up to 20 years for certain other improvements.\nReal estate investment properties are stated at historic cost less depreciation. Although the Company intends to own its real estate investment properties over a long term, from time to time it will evaluate its market position, market conditions, and other factors and may elect to sell properties that do not conform to the Company's investment profile. Management believes that the Company's real estate assets have generally appreciated in value since their acquisition or development and, accordingly, the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the Company's liabilities as reported in the financial statements. Because the financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, they do not report the current value of the Company's real estate investment properties.\nOn November 20, 2017, the Company closed on a 15-year, non-recourse $60.0 million mortgage loan secured by Washington Square. The loan matures in 2032, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.75%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $308,500 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $31.1 million. Proceeds were used to repay the remaining balance of approximately $28.1 million on the existing mortgage and reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility.\nThe Company purchases real estate investment properties from time to time and records assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases and customer relationships based on their relative fair values. The fair value of buildings generally is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates and considers the present\nOlney Shopping Center\n \u2022 distributions to common stockholders totaling $39.5 million; \nThe Company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50%, which allows the Company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary. As of December 31, 2017, amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2019 to 2035 represented approximately 92.2% of the Company's notes payable, thus minimizing refinancing risk. The Company's variable-rate debt consists of a $14.1 million bank term loan secured by the Metro Pike Center, which was repaid in full in January 2018, and $61.0 million outstanding under the unsecured revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has loan availability of approximately $213.8 million under its $275.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOn March 3, 2015, the Company closed on a 15-year, $30.0 million non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Boulevard and Shops at Fairfax shopping centers in Fairfax, Virginia. The loan matures in 2030, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.69%, requires monthly principal and interest payments totaling $153,300 based on a\nBeacon Center\nOn January 12, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase for $35.5 million, plus approximately $0.7 million of acquisition costs, a 69,600 square foot office building and the underlying ground located at 7316 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland and has an earnest money deposit of $3.5 million at risk. The property has mixed-use development potential of up to 325 apartment units and approximately 10,000 square feet of street level retail pursuant to the recently approved Bethesda Downtown Plan. The purchase price will be funded through the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company anticipates closing the acquisition on or before January 12, 2019.\nAlthough it is management's present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and office properties in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Company may, in the future, also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves. While the Company may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, the Company does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of Company assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area.\nAcquisition related costs\nThe Operating Partnership entered into a Credit Agreement dated January 26, 2018, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Capital One, National Association, as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Capital One, National Association, as Joint Lead Arrangers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Capital One, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, TD Bank, N.A., Regions Bank and Associated Bank, National Association, as Lenders (the New Credit Agreement\u201d).\n7316 Wisconsin Avenue\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nReal estate taxes increased $2.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.7 million), (b) Burtonsville Town Square ($0.4 million) and (c) small increases at various properties throughout the portfolio. Real estate taxes increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.3 million) and (b) small increases throughout the remainder of the portfolio.\n (a) The loan was collateralized by Washington Square and required equal monthly principal and interest payments of $264,000 based upon a 27.5-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.0 million at loan maturity. In 2017, the loan was repaid in full and replaced with a new $60.0 million loan. See (hh) below. \n (b) The loan is collateralized by three shopping centers, Broadlands Village, The Glen and Kentlands Square I, and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $306,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.4 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.8 million was amortized during 2017. \nThe Company and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company have guaranteed the payment obligations of the Partnership under the New Facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company purchased for $22.7 million, including acquisition costs, the land underlying Beacon Center. The land was previously leased by the Company with an annual rent of approximately $60,000. The purchase price was funded in part by an $11.25 million increase to the existing mortgage collateralized by Beacon Center and in part by the Company's revolving credit facility.\n (l) The loan is collateralized by Lansdowne Town Center and requires monthly principal and interest payments of $230,000 based on a 30-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.2 million at loan maturity. Principal of $898,000 was amortized during 2017. \nThe New Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement dated June 24, 2014, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Capital One, N.A. and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania as Lenders (as amended, the Original Agreement\u201d). The Original Agreement consisted of a $275,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the Original Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 23, 2018 and bore interest at a variable rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 145 basis points to 200 basis points, as determined by certain leverage tests. As of the date the Original Facility was replaced, the applicable spread was 1.45%.\n (w) The loan is collateralized by Severna Park MarketPlace and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $207,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.3 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.1 million was amortized during 2017. \nBurtonsville Town Square\n (h) The loan is collateralized by Palm Springs Center and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $75,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $7.1 million at loan maturity. Principal of $453,000 was amortized during 2017. \nThe following is a discussion of the components of revenue and expense for the entire Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe recent period of economic expansion has now run in excess of five years. While economic conditions within the local Washington, DC metropolitan area have remained relatively stable, issues facing the Federal government relating to taxation, spending and interest rate policy will likely impact the office, retail and residential real estate markets over the coming years. Because the majority of the Company's property operating income is produced by our shopping centers, we continually monitor the implications of government policy changes, as well as shifts in consumer demand between on-line and in-store shopping, on future shopping center construction and retailer store expansion plans. Based on our observations, we continue to adapt our marketing and merchandising strategies in a way to maximize our future performance. The Company's commercial leasing percentage, on a comparable property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, declined to 94.2% at December 31, 2017, from 95.5% at December 31, 2016.\nThe organizational documents of the Company do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that it may incur. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, reevaluate the Company's debt capitalization policy in light of current economic conditions, relative costs of capital, market values of the Company property portfolio, opportunities for acquisition, development or expansion, and such other factors as the Board of Directors then deems relevant. The Board of Directors may modify the Company's debt capitalization policy based on such a reevaluation without shareholder approval and consequently, may increase or decrease the Company's debt to total asset ratio above or below 50% or may waive the policy for certain periods of time. The Company selectively continues to refinance or renegotiate the terms of its outstanding debt in order to achieve longer maturities, and obtain generally more favorable loan terms, whenever management determines the financing environment is favorable.\nThe 2016 Mixed-Use leasing percentage includes the recently-developed Park Van Ness commercial space and excludes Crosstown Business Center. The residential components of Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness were 97.1% and 72.7% leased at December 31, 2016. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage increased to 96.0% from 95.4% and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage decreased to 90.9% from 92.2%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, increased to 95.4% at December 31, 2016 from 95.0% at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 payments of $2.6 million for financing costs of mortgage notes payable;  which was partially offset by:\n\nOperating Activities\nIn February 2015, the Company purchased for $0.9 million, including acquisition costs, a 1.1 acre retail pad site in Frederick, Maryland, which is contiguous with and an expansion of the Company's other Westview asset.\n\n \u2022 distributions to holders of convertible limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership totaling $15.3 million; \nThe Clarendon Center residential component was 99.2% leased at December 31, 2015. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage increased to 95.3% from 95.0%. and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage increased to 91.0% from 90.8%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, increased to 94.7% at December 31, 2015 from 94.4% at December 31, 2014.\n\nThe Company's redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties, by replacing below-market-rent leases with strong, traffic-generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores, as well as other desirable local, regional and national tenants. The Company's strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing Shopping Centers, while enhancing this growth with selective acquisitions, redevelopments and renovations.\nThe residential components of Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness were 96.7% and 95.9% leased, respectively, at December 31, 2017. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage decreased to 94.2%\nfrom 96.1% and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage increased to 94.5% from 91.0%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, decreased to 94.2% at December 31, 2017 from 95.5% at December 31, 2016.\nProperty Sales\n\nDuring 2017, the Company entered into 475 new or renewed apartment leases, excluding new leases at Park Van Ness. The monthly rent per square foot for the 395 leases for units that were previously occupied decreased to $3.51 from $3.54. During 2016, the Company entered into 216 new or renewed apartment leases. The\nPreferred Stock Issues\nOn August 14, 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially fund the Glebe Road development project. The loan matures in 2035, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.67%, requires interest only payments, which will be funded by the loan, until conversion to permanent. The conversion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021, and thereafter, monthly principal and interest payments of $887,900 based on a 25-year amortization schedule will be required.\nPortfolio Leasing Status\n (k) The loan is collateralized by Hunt Club Corners and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $42,000 based upon a 30-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $5.0 million, at loan maturity. Principal of $159,000 was amortized during 2017. \nIn January 2017, the Company purchased for $76.4 million, including acquisition costs, Burtonsville Town Square, a 121,000 square foot shopping center located in Burtonsville, Maryland. Burtonsville Town Square is 100% leased and anchored by Giant Food and CVS Pharmacy. The purchase was funded with a new $40.0 million mortgage loan and through the Company's credit line facility. The mortgage bears interest at 3.39%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $197,900 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule, and has a 15-year maturity. The Company expects to begin construction on a 16,000 square foot small shop expansion in the Spring of 2018, with delivery projected in late 2018. The total development cost is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. Lease negotiations are in progress for over 50% of the space.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\nIn light of the limited amount of quality properties for sale and the escalated pricing of properties that the Company has been presented with or has inquired about over the past year, management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new Shopping Center and Mixed-Use Properties in the near future is uncertain. Because of its conservative capital structure, including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility, management believes that the Company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are identified and market conditions improve. (See Item 1. Business - Capital Policies\u201d). It is management's view that several of the sub-markets in which the Company operates have, or are expected to have in the future, attractive supply/demand characteristics. The Company will continue to evaluate acquisition, development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this report. Historical results set forth in Selected Financial Information, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data included in Item 6 and Item 8 and this section should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future operations.\nAcquisition related costs in 2016 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of a retail pad site adjacent to the Company's existing Thruway Shopping Center. Acquisition related costs in 2015 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of 726 N. Glebe Road.\n * Interest rate and scheduled maturity data presented as of December 31, 2017. Totals computed using weighted averages. \n (i) The loan and a corresponding interest-rate swap closed on June 29, 2010 and are collateralized by Thruway. On a combined basis, the loan and the interest-rate swap require equal monthly principal and interest payments of $289,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $34.8 million at loan maturity.

Property operating expenses increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWhen incurred, the Company capitalizes the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment. All repair and maintenance expenditures are expensed when incurred. Leasehold improvements expenditures are capitalized when certain criteria are met, including when we supervise construction and will own the improvement. Tenant improvements we own are depreciated over the life of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nIn addition, substantially all of the Company's properties are leased to tenants under long-term leases, which provide for reimbursement of operating expenses by tenants. These leases tend to reduce the Company's exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the Company's tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in their revenue.\n \u2022 proceeds of $22.8 million from the issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment program, directors deferred plan and from the exercise of stock options; and \nrecoveries ($1.1 million), and (d) the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($0.1 million) partially offset by (e) a 144,327 square foot decrease in leased space ($2.7 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike and (f) lower other income ($0.3 million), exclusive of the termination fees at 11503 Rockville Pike and Broadlands. Total revenue increased 3.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) a $0.32 per square foot increase in base rent ($2.8 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) higher residential base rent ($2.3 million), (c) the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($1.9 million), and (d) higher expense recoveries ($1.4 million) partially offset by (e) a 4,185 square foot decrease in leased space ($0.1 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike.

Receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established with a charge to current period operations when, in the opinion of management, collection of the receivable is doubtful. In addition to rents due currently, accounts receivable include amounts representing minimum rental income accrued on a straight-line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases. Reserves are established with a charge to income for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant's ability to perform under its lease obligations.\n (r) The loan is collateralized by White Oak and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $193,000 based upon a 24.4 year weighted amortization schedule and a final payment of $18.5 million at loan maturity. The loan was previously collateralized by Van Ness Square. During 2012, the Company substituted White Oak as the collateral and borrowed an additional $10.5 million.

The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nSame property revenue and same property operating income are non-GAAP financial measures of performance and improve the comparability of these measures by excluding the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods.\n (p) The loan is collateralized by Leesburg Pike and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $135,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $11.5 million at loan maturity.

FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding extraordinary items, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from property dispositions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, which is disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time (i.e. depreciation), which is contrary to what we believe occurs with our assets, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs.\nShort-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses and capital expenditures, debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt), distributions to common and preferred stockholders, distributions to unit holders and amounts required for expansion and renovation of the Current Portfolio Properties and selective acquisition and development of additional properties. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income,\u201d as defined in the Code. The Company expects to meet these short-term liquidity requirements (other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions and developments) through cash provided from operations, available cash and its existing line of credit.\n25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $15.5 million at maturity.

Principal of $830,000 was amortized during 2017. \nSame property revenue and same property operating income are used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of our properties, and to determine trends in earnings, because these measures are not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to ownership of our properties. We believe the exclusion of these items from revenue and operating income is useful because the resulting measures capture the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred by operating our properties.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of financial position and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. The Company has identified the following policies that, due to estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, involve a relatively high degree of judgment and complexity.\nThe New Credit Agreement consists of a $400,000,000 credit facility (the New Facility\u201d), of which $325,000,000 is a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Line\u201d) and $75,000,000 is a term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended.\n (j) The loan is collateralized by Jamestown Place and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $66,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $6.1 million at loan maturity.

The space was previously occupied by an office supply store that had vacated in mid 2014 and the lease was scheduled to expire in 2019. The termination fee revenue was partially offset by the loss of approximately $1.1 million in rental revenue over the remainder of 2016. The Company executed leases with two replacement tenants, whose occupancy and rent commencement occurred in 2017. While the Company continues to plan for a mixed-use development at this site and its neighboring Metro Pike Center, the initial phases of this development are expected to be on the west side of Rockville Pike at Metro Pike Center.

Recognition of rental income commences when control of the space has been given to the tenant. When rental payments due under leases vary from a straight-line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases, income is recognized on a straight-line basis throughout the term of the lease. Expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to tenants, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs. Expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred. Rental income based on a tenant's revenue, known as percentage rent, is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint specified in the lease agreement.\nCapital Strategy and Financing Activity\nvalue of all cash flows expected to be generated by the property including an initial lease up period. The Company determines the fair value of above and below market intangibles associated with in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the in-place lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition taking into consideration the remaining contractual lease period, renewal periods, and the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options. The fair value of a below market lease component is recorded as deferred income and accreted as additional lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease period. If the fair value of the below market lease intangible includes fair value associated with a renewal option, such amounts are not accreted until the renewal option is exercised. If the renewal option is not exercised the value is recognized at that time. The fair value of above market lease intangibles is recorded as a deferred asset and is amortized as a reduction of lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease term. The Company determines the fair value of at-market in-place leases considering the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period and carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. Intangible assets associated with at-market in-place leases are amortized as additional expense over the remaining contractual lease term. To the extent customer relationship intangibles are present in an acquisition, the fair value of the intangibles are amortized over the life of the customer relationship. From time to time the Company may purchase a property for future development purposes. The property may be improved with an existing structure that would be demolished as part of the development. In such cases, the fair value of the building may be determined based only on existing leases and not include estimated cash flows related to future leases. Acquisition-related transaction costs are either (a) expensed as incurred when related to business combinations or (b) capitalized to land and/or building when related to asset acquisitions.\n2016 Financing Activity\nIn December 2016, the Company sold for $5.4 million the 197,100 square foot Crosstown Business Center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and recognized a $1.0 million gain.\nGain on sale of property in 2016 resulted from the December 2016 sale of Crosstown Business Center.\nGain on Sales of Properties\nOn April 1, 2015, the Company closed on a 15-year, non-recourse $16.0 million mortgage loan secured by Northrock. The loan matures in 2030, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.99%, requires monthly principal and interest payments totaling $84,400 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $8.4 million at maturity. Proceeds of the loan were used to repay in full the $14.5 million remaining balance of existing debt secured by Northrock.\nGeneral and administrative costs increased $0.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) increased salary and benefit expense ($0.6 million).

The monthly rent per square foot for these leases was unchanged at $3.45.\nWe define same property revenue as total revenue minus the sum of interest income and revenue of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods, and we define same property operating income as net income plus the sum of interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expense, loss on the early extinguishment of debt (if any), predevelopment expense and acquisition related costs, minus the sum of interest income, the change in the fair value of derivatives, gains on property dispositions (if any) and the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods.\nFrom 2014 through 2016, the Company purchased four adjacent properties for an aggregate $54.0 million located on N. Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia. The Company is developing approximately 490 residential units and 60,000 square feet of retail space on 2.8 acres of land. Excavation, sheeting and shoring are substantially complete and construction is proceeding on the first three levels of the below grade parking structure.

The availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions.\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, which are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes the final outcome of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or the results of operations. Upon determination that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine.\nReal estate taxes\n\n (1) See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Headquarters Lease amounts represent an allocation to the Company based upon employees' time dedicated to the Company's business as specified in the Shared Services Agreement. Future amounts are subject to change as the number of employees employed by each of the parties to the lease fluctuates.  Management believes that the Company's cash flow from operations and its capital resources, which at December 31, 2017, included cash balances of $10.9 million and borrowing availability of approximately $213.8 million on its revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet its contractual obligations for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 972,950 square feet of Commercial space was subject to leases scheduled to expire in 2018.

Although not currently planned, it is possible that the Company may redevelop additional Current Portfolio Properties and may develop expansions within certain of the Shopping Centers. Acquisition and development of properties are undertaken only after careful analysis and review, and management's determination that such properties are expected to provide long-term earnings and cash flow growth. During the coming year, any developments, expansions or acquisitions are expected to be funded with borrowings from the Company's credit line, construction financing, proceeds from the operation of the Company's dividend reinvestment plan or other external capital resources available to the Company.\n \u2022 proceeds of $6.7 million from the issuance of limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership under the dividend reinvestment program; \nAlbertson's/Safeway, a tenant at eight of the Company's shopping centers, closed two Safeway stores located at the Company's properties during the June 2016 quarter. The stores that closed were located in Broadlands Village, Loudoun County, Virginia and Briggs Chaney Plaza, Montgomery County, Maryland. The lease at Briggs Chaney remains in full force and effect and Albertson's/Safeway has executed a sublease with a replacement grocer, Global Foods, for that space, which commenced operations in March 2017. The Company terminated the lease with Albertson's/Safeway at Broadlands and has executed a lease with Aldi Food Market for 20,000 square feet of this space which opened in November 2017.

The Company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in identifying impairment indicators including recurring operating losses, significant decreases in occupancy, and significant adverse changes in legal factors and business climate. If impairment indicators are present, the Company compares the projected cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of that property. The Company assesses its undiscounted projected cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates, historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted projected cash flows, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its then estimated fair value. The fair value of any property is sensitive to the actual results of any of the aforementioned estimated factors, either individually or taken as a whole. Should the actual results differ from management's projections, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.\n (ii) The Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with its Olney property and is accounting for that transaction as a secured financing. The arrangement requires monthly payments of $60,400 which increase by 1.5% on May 1, 2015, and every May 1 thereafter. The arrangement provides for a final payment of $14.7 million and has an implicit interest rate of 8.0%. Negative amortization in 2017 totaled $167,000. \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) begins with the Company's primary business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of the Company's business. This is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that the Company believes are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the Company's reported financial results. The next section, beginning on page 44, discusses the Company's results of operations for the past two years. Beginning on page 49, the Company provides an analysis of its liquidity and capital resources, including discussions of its cash flows, debt arrangements, sources of capital and financial commitments. Finally, on page 57, the Company discusses funds from operations, or FFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT used by the REIT industry.\nThe following table shows selected data for leases executed in the indicated periods. The information is based on executed leases without adjustment for the timing of occupancy, tenant defaults, or landlord concessions. The base rent for an expiring lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expiration date of the lease. The base rent for a new or renewed lease is the annualized contractual base rent, on a cash basis, as of the expected rent commencement date. Because tenants that execute leases may not ultimately take possession of their space or pay all of their contractual rent, the changes presented in the table provide information only about trends in market rental rates. The actual changes in rental income received by the Company may be different.\nCertain initial direct costs incurred by the Company in negotiating and consummating successful commercial leases are capitalized and amortized over the term of the leases. Deferred leasing costs consist of\nCash and cash equivalents were $10.9 million and $8.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Principal of $394,000 was amortized during 2017. \nOn January 26, 2018, the Company replaced its credit facility. The new credit facility, which can be used for working capital, property acquisitions, development projects or letters of credit, totals $400,000,000 (the New Facility\u201d), of which $325,000,000 is a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Line\u201d) and $75,000,000 is a term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Revolving Line matures on January 26, 2022, which term may be extended by the Company for one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Term Loan matures on January 26, 2023, and may not be extended. In general, loan availability under the New Facility is primarily determined by operating income from the Company's existing unencumbered properties. Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the Revolving Line, and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the Term Loan, each as determined by certain leverage tests. As of January 26, 2018, the applicable spread for borrowings is 135 basis points under the Revolving Line and 130 basis points under the Term Loan.

Saul Real Estate Investment Trust (the Trust\u201d), for an initial purchase price of $8.8 million, approximately 14.3 acres of land located at the intersection of Ashburn Village Boulevard and Russell Branch Parkway in Loudoun County, Virginia. The land is zoned for up to 115,000 square feet of retail development. In order to allow the Company time to pre-lease and complete project plans and specifications, the parties have agreed to a closing date in the second quarter of 2018, at which time the Company will exchange limited partnership units for the land. The number of limited partnership units to be exchanged will be based on the initial purchase price and the average share value (as defined in the agreement) of the Company's common stock at the time of the exchange. The Company intends to construct a shopping center and, upon stabilization, may be obligated to issue additional limited partnership units to the Trust.\nEffective September 1, 2017, the Company's $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan, which is fully drawn and secured by Park Van Ness, converted to permanent financing.

As leases expire, management expects to revise rental rates, lease terms and conditions, relocate existing tenants, reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goals of increasing occupancy, improving overall retail sales, and ultimately increasing cash flow as economic conditions improve. In those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring, management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means, or in connection with renovations or relocations, recapturing leases with below market rents and re-leasing at market rates, as well as replacing financially troubled tenants. When possible, management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent, as well as percentage rental provisions, in its leases.\nThe provision for credit losses represents the Company's estimate of amounts owed by tenants that may not be collectible and was 0.40%, 0.69%, and 0.44% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Excavation, sheeting and shoring are substantially complete and construction is proceeding on the first three levels of the below grade parking structure. The development is scheduled for substantial completion in early 2020. The total cost of the project, including acquisition of land, is expected to be approximately $275.0 million. In 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially finance the project. Leases have been executed for a 41,500 square foot Target and 9,000 square feet of retail shop space, resulting in approximately 84% of the retail space being leased.\nIn 2016, the Company completed development of Park Van Ness, a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking, and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room, a wi-fi lounge/business center, and a rooftop pool and deck. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral and administrative\nResults of Operations\nThe Company has been selectively involved in acquisition, development, redevelopment and renovation activities. It continues to evaluate the acquisition of land parcels for retail and office development and acquisitions of operating properties for opportunities to enhance operating income and cash flow growth. The following describes significant acquisitions, developments, redevelopments and renovations which affected the Company's financial position and results of operations in 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\n (o) The loan is collateralized by Great Falls shopping center. The loan consists of three notes which require equal monthly principal and interest payments of $138,000 based upon a weighted average 26-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $6.3 million at maturity. Principal of $824,000 was amortized during 2017. \nSame property revenue and same property operating income are measures of the operating performance of our properties but do not measure our performance as a whole.

Principal of $589,000 was amortized during 2017. \nAs a general policy, the Company intends to maintain a ratio of its total debt to total asset value of 50% or less and to actively manage the Company's leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges. Asset value is the aggregate fair market value of the Current Portfolio Properties and any subsequently acquired properties as reasonably determined by management by reference to the properties' aggregate cash flow. Given the Company's current debt level, it is management's belief that the ratio of the Company's debt to total asset value was below 50% as of December 31, 2017.\n(ff) The loan is collateralized by Burtonsville Town Square and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $198,000 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.3 million at loan maturity.

Principal of $696,000 was amortized during 2017. \nInterest, real estate taxes, development-related salary costs and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction. Upon substantial completion of construction, the assets are placed in service, rental income, direct operating expenses, and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations. Commercial development projects are substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity. Residential development projects are considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon receipt of the certificate of occupancy from the appropriate licensing authority. Substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives of generally between 35 and 50 years for base buildings, or a shorter period if management determines that the building has a shorter useful life, and up to 20 years for certain other improvements.\nReal estate investment properties are stated at historic cost less depreciation. Although the Company intends to own its real estate investment properties over a long term, from time to time it will evaluate its market position, market conditions, and other factors and may elect to sell properties that do not conform to the Company's investment profile. Management believes that the Company's real estate assets have generally appreciated in value since their acquisition or development and, accordingly, the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the Company's liabilities as reported in the financial statements. Because the financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, they do not report the current value of the Company's real estate investment properties.\nOn November 20, 2017, the Company closed on a 15-year, non-recourse $60.0 million mortgage loan secured by Washington Square. The loan matures in 2032, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.75%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $308,500 based on a 25-year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $31.1 million. Proceeds were used to repay the remaining balance of approximately $28.1 million on the existing mortgage and reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility.\nThe Company purchases real estate investment properties from time to time and records assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases and customer relationships based on their relative fair values. The fair value of buildings generally is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates and considers the present\nOlney Shopping Center\n \u2022 distributions to common stockholders totaling $39.5 million; \nThe Company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50%, which allows the Company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary. As of December 31, 2017, amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2019 to 2035 represented approximately 92.2% of the Company's notes payable, thus minimizing refinancing risk. The Company's variable-rate debt consists of a $14.1 million bank term loan secured by the Metro Pike Center, which was repaid in full in January 2018, and $61.0 million outstanding under the unsecured revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has loan availability of approximately $213.8 million under its $275.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit.\nOn March 3, 2015, the Company closed on a 15-year, $30.0 million non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Boulevard and Shops at Fairfax shopping centers in Fairfax, Virginia.

The property has mixed-use development potential of up to 325 apartment units and approximately 10,000 square feet of street level retail pursuant to the recently approved Bethesda Downtown Plan. The purchase price will be funded through the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company anticipates closing the acquisition on or before January 12, 2019.\nAlthough it is management's present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and office properties in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Company may, in the future, also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves. While the Company may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, the Company does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of Company assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area.\nAcquisition related costs\nThe Operating Partnership entered into a Credit Agreement dated January 26, 2018, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Capital One, National Association, as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Capital One, National Association, as Joint Lead Arrangers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Capital One, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, TD Bank, N.A., Regions Bank and Associated Bank, National Association, as Lenders (the New Credit Agreement\u201d).\n7316 Wisconsin Avenue\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nReal estate taxes increased $2.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.7 million), (b) Burtonsville Town Square ($0.4 million) and (c) small increases at various properties throughout the portfolio. Real estate taxes increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) Park Van Ness ($0.3 million) and (b) small increases throughout the remainder of the portfolio.\n (a) The loan was collateralized by Washington Square and required equal monthly principal and interest payments of $264,000 based upon a 27.5-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.0 million at loan maturity. In 2017, the loan was repaid in full and replaced with a new $60.0 million loan. See (hh) below. \n (b) The loan is collateralized by three shopping centers, Broadlands Village, The Glen and Kentlands Square I, and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $306,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.4 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.8 million was amortized during 2017. \nThe Company and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company have guaranteed the payment obligations of the Partnership under the New Facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company purchased for $22.7 million, including acquisition costs, the land underlying Beacon Center. The land was previously leased by the Company with an annual rent of approximately $60,000. The purchase price was funded in part by an $11.25 million increase to the existing mortgage collateralized by Beacon Center and in part by the Company's revolving credit facility.\n (l) The loan is collateralized by Lansdowne Town Center and requires monthly principal and interest payments of $230,000 based on a 30-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $28.2 million at loan maturity. Principal of $898,000 was amortized during 2017. \nThe New Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement dated June 24, 2014, by and among the Operating Partnership, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Capital One, N.A. and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania as Lenders (as amended, the Original Agreement\u201d). The Original Agreement consisted of a $275,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the Original Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 23, 2018 and bore interest at a variable rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 145 basis points to 200 basis points, as determined by certain leverage tests. As of the date the Original Facility was replaced, the applicable spread was 1.45%.\n (w) The loan is collateralized by Severna Park MarketPlace and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $207,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.3 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.1 million was amortized during 2017. \nBurtonsville Town Square\n (h) The loan is collateralized by Palm Springs Center and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $75,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $7.1 million at loan maturity. Principal of $453,000 was amortized during 2017. \nThe following is a discussion of the components of revenue and expense for the entire Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe recent period of economic expansion has now run in excess of five years. While economic conditions within the local Washington, DC metropolitan area have remained relatively stable, issues facing the Federal government relating to taxation, spending and interest rate policy will likely impact the office, retail and residential real estate markets over the coming years. Because the majority of the Company's property operating income is produced by our shopping centers, we continually monitor the implications of government policy changes, as well as shifts in consumer demand between on-line and in-store shopping, on future shopping center construction and retailer store expansion plans. Based on our observations, we continue to adapt our marketing and merchandising strategies in a way to maximize our future performance. The Company's commercial leasing percentage, on a comparable property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, declined to 94.2% at December 31, 2017, from 95.5% at December 31, 2016.\nThe organizational documents of the Company do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that it may incur. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, reevaluate the Company's debt capitalization policy in light of current economic conditions, relative costs of capital, market values of the Company property portfolio, opportunities for acquisition, development or expansion, and such other factors as the Board of Directors then deems relevant. The Board of Directors may modify the Company's debt capitalization policy based on such a reevaluation without shareholder approval and consequently, may increase or decrease the Company's debt to total asset ratio above or below 50% or may waive the policy for certain periods of time. The Company selectively continues to refinance or renegotiate the terms of its outstanding debt in order to achieve longer maturities, and obtain generally more favorable loan terms, whenever management determines the financing environment is favorable.\nThe 2016 Mixed-Use leasing percentage includes the recently-developed Park Van Ness commercial space and excludes Crosstown Business Center. The residential components of Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness were 97.1% and 72.7% leased at December 31, 2016. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage increased to 96.0% from 95.4% and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage decreased to 90.9% from 92.2%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, increased to 95.4% at December 31, 2016 from 95.0% at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 payments of $2.6 million for financing costs of mortgage notes payable;  which was partially offset by:\n\nOperating Activities\nIn February 2015, the Company purchased for $0.9 million, including acquisition costs, a 1.1 acre retail pad site in Frederick, Maryland, which is contiguous with and an expansion of the Company's other Westview asset.\n\n \u2022 distributions to holders of convertible limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership totaling $15.3 million; \nThe Clarendon Center residential component was 99.2% leased at December 31, 2015. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage increased to 95.3% from 95.0%. and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage increased to 91.0% from 90.8%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, increased to 94.7% at December 31, 2015 from 94.4% at December 31, 2014.\n\nThe Company's redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties, by replacing below-market-rent leases with strong, traffic-generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores, as well as other desirable local, regional and national tenants. The Company's strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing Shopping Centers, while enhancing this growth with selective acquisitions, redevelopments and renovations.\nThe residential components of Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness were 96.7% and 95.9% leased, respectively, at December 31, 2017. On a same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, the Shopping Center leasing percentage decreased to 94.2%\nfrom 96.1% and the Mixed-Use leasing percentage increased to 94.5% from 91.0%. The overall portfolio leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, decreased to 94.2% at December 31, 2017 from 95.5% at December 31, 2016.\nProperty Sales\n\nDuring 2017, the Company entered into 475 new or renewed apartment leases, excluding new leases at Park Van Ness. The monthly rent per square foot for the 395 leases for units that were previously occupied decreased to $3.51 from $3.54. During 2016, the Company entered into 216 new or renewed apartment leases. The\nPreferred Stock Issues\nOn August 14, 2017, the Company closed on a $157.0 million construction-to-permanent loan, the proceeds of which will be used to partially fund the Glebe Road development project. The loan matures in 2035, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.67%, requires interest only payments, which will be funded by the loan, until conversion to permanent. The conversion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021, and thereafter, monthly principal and interest payments of $887,900 based on a 25-year amortization schedule will be required.\nPortfolio Leasing Status\n (k) The loan is collateralized by Hunt Club Corners and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $42,000 based upon a 30-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $5.0 million, at loan maturity. Principal of $159,000 was amortized during 2017. \nIn January 2017, the Company purchased for $76.4 million, including acquisition costs, Burtonsville Town Square, a 121,000 square foot shopping center located in Burtonsville, Maryland. Burtonsville Town Square is 100% leased and anchored by Giant Food and CVS Pharmacy. The purchase was funded with a new $40.0 million mortgage loan and through the Company's credit line facility. The mortgage bears interest at 3.39%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $197,900 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule, and has a 15-year maturity. The Company expects to begin construction on a 16,000 square foot small shop expansion in the Spring of 2018, with delivery projected in late 2018. The total development cost is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. Lease negotiations are in progress for over 50% of the space.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\nIn light of the limited amount of quality properties for sale and the escalated pricing of properties that the Company has been presented with or has inquired about over the past year, management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new Shopping Center and Mixed-Use Properties in the near future is uncertain. Because of its conservative capital structure, including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility, management believes that the Company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are identified and market conditions improve. (See Item 1. Business - Capital Policies\u201d). It is management's view that several of the sub-markets in which the Company operates have, or are expected to have in the future, attractive supply/demand characteristics. The Company will continue to evaluate acquisition, development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this report. Historical results set forth in Selected Financial Information, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data included in Item 6 and Item 8 and this section should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future operations.\nAcquisition related costs in 2016 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of a retail pad site adjacent to the Company's existing Thruway Shopping Center. Acquisition related costs in 2015 totaling approximately $0.1 million relate to the purchase of 726 N. Glebe Road.\n * Interest rate and scheduled maturity data presented as of December 31, 2017. Totals computed using weighted averages. \n (i) The loan and a corresponding interest-rate swap closed on June 29, 2010 and are collateralized by Thruway. On a combined basis, the loan and the interest-rate swap require equal monthly principal and interest payments of $289,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $34.8 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.2 million was amortized during 2017. \nSame property operating income\n \u2022 proceeds of $6.9 million from the issuance of limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership under the dividend reinvestment program; \n (hh) The loan is collateralized by Washington Square and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $308,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $31.1 million at loan maturity. \nProperty operating expenses increased $0.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Property operating expenses increased $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWhen incurred, the Company capitalizes the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment. All repair and maintenance expenditures are expensed when incurred. Leasehold improvements expenditures are capitalized when certain criteria are met, including when we supervise construction and will own the improvement. Tenant improvements we own are depreciated over the life of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nIn addition, substantially all of the Company's properties are leased to tenants under long-term leases, which provide for reimbursement of operating expenses by tenants. These leases tend to reduce the Company's exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the Company's tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in their revenue.\n \u2022 proceeds of $22.8 million from the issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment program, directors deferred plan and from the exercise of stock options; and \nrecoveries ($1.1 million), and (d) the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($0.1 million) partially offset by (e) a 144,327 square foot decrease in leased space ($2.7 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike and (f) lower other income ($0.3 million), exclusive of the termination fees at 11503 Rockville Pike and Broadlands. Total revenue increased 3.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to (a) a $0.32 per square foot increase in base rent ($2.8 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) higher residential base rent ($2.3 million), (c) the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($1.9 million), and (d) higher expense recoveries ($1.4 million) partially offset by (e) a 4,185 square foot decrease in leased space ($0.1 million) exclusive of the impact of a lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike. A discussion of the components of revenue follows.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 proceeds of $21.6 million received from the issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment program and from the exercise of stock options; and \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - Current and Deferred Receivables\nGreat Eastern Shopping Center\nOther revenue\nThe Company has outstanding 7.2 million depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of 6.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series C Stock\"). The depositary shares may be redeemed at the Company's option, in whole or in part, on or after February 12, 2018, at the $25.00 liquidation preference, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. The depositary shares pay an annual dividend of $1.71875 per share, equivalent to 6.875% of the $25.00 liquidation preference. The Series C Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any other securities of the Company except in connection with certain changes of control or delisting events. Investors in the depositary shares generally have no voting rights, but will have limited voting rights if the Company fails to pay dividends for six or more quarters (whether or not declared or consecutive) and in certain other events.\n (t) The loan is collateralized by Ashburn Village and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $240,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $20.5 million at loan maturity. Principal of $797,000 was amortized during 2017. \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $14.4 million to $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities represents, in each year, cash received primarily from rental income, plus other income, less property operating expenses, normal recurring general and administrative expenses and interest payments on debt outstanding.\nThe tables below provide reconciliations of total revenue and operating income under GAAP to same property revenue and operating income for the indicated periods. The same property results include 48 Shopping Centers and five Mixed-Use properties for each period.\nImpact of Inflation\nIn January 2017, the Company purchased for $76.4 million, including acquisition costs, Burtonsville Town Square, a 121,000 square foot shopping center located in Burtonsville, Maryland. Burtonsville Town Square is 100% leased and anchored by Giant Food and CVS Pharmacy. The purchase was funded with a new $40.0 million mortgage loan and through the Company's credit line facility. The Company expects to begin construction on a 16,000 square foot small shop expansion in the Spring of 2018, with delivery projected in late 2018. The total development cost is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. Lease negotiations are in progress for over 50% of the space.\nIn 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased three properties, with approximately 57,400 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate $25.2 million. The three properties are adjacent to an existing property on the east side of Rockville Pike near the Twinbrook Metro station. Combined, the four properties total 10.3 acres and are zoned for up to 1.2 million square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction.\n \u2022 the repayment of amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility totaling $51.0 million; \nAcquisition and development of properties are undertaken only after careful analysis and review, and management's determination that such properties are expected to provide long-term earnings and cash flow growth. During the coming year, developments, expansions or acquisitions are expected to be funded with available cash,\n\nAccounts receivable primarily represent amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the terms of the respective leases, subject to the Company's revenue recognition policy. Receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established with a charge to current period operations when, in the opinion of management, collection of the receivable is doubtful. In addition to rents due currently, accounts receivable include amounts representing minimum rental income accrued on a straight-line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases. Reserves are established with a charge to income for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant's ability to perform under its lease obligations.\n (r) The loan is collateralized by White Oak and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $193,000 based upon a 24.4 year weighted amortization schedule and a final payment of $18.5 million at loan maturity. The loan was previously collateralized by Van Ness Square. During 2012, the Company substituted White Oak as the collateral and borrowed an additional $10.5 million. Principal of $631,000 was amortized during 2017. \nPredevelopment expenses include lease termination costs and demolition costs which are related to development projects and do not meet the criteria to be capitalized.\nThe Company's principal business activity is the ownership, management and development of income-producing properties. The Company's long-term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had unfunded contractual payment obligations of approximately $228.8 million, excluding operating obligations, due within the next 12 months. The table below shows the total contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2017.\nSame property operating income increased $1.1 million for 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to\nIn 2016, the Company completed development of Park Van Ness, a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking, and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room, a wi-fi lounge/business center, and a rooftop pool and deck. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which on the east side are below street level. Because of the change in grade from the street eastward to Rock Creek Park, apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. As of December 31, 2017, 260 apartments (95.9%) were leased. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land, which the Company has owned, was approximately $93.0 million, a portion of which was financed with a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan.\nSame property revenue and same property operating income are non-GAAP financial measures of performance and improve the comparability of these measures by excluding the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods.\n (p) The loan is collateralized by Leesburg Pike and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $135,000 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $11.5 million at loan maturity.

Expense recovery income increased $1.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher real estate tax expense.\n (z) The loan in the original amount of $73.0 million closed in May 2012, is collateralized by Seven Corners and requires equal monthly principal and interest payments of $463,200 based upon a 25-year amortization schedule and a final payment of $42.3 million at loan maturity. Principal of $1.7 million was amortized during 2017. \nIn general, loan availability under the New Facility is primarily determined by operating income from the Company's existing unencumbered properties. Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the Revolving Line, and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the Term Loan, each as determined by certain leverage tests. As of January 26, 2018, the applicable spread for borrowings is 135 basis points under the Revolving Line and 130 basis points under the Term Loan.\n (gg) The loan is a $71.6 million construction-to-permanent facility that is collateralized by and financed a portion of the construction costs of Park Van Ness. During the construction period, interest was funded by the loan. Effective September 1, 2017, the loan converted to permanent financing and requires monthly principal and \nThe carrying value of properties collateralizing the mortgage notes payable totaled $1.0 billion and $957.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
