Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections titled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that may never materialize or that may be proven incorrect. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the sections titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nBusiness\nIndependent talent is an increasingly sought-after, critical, and expanding segment of the global workforce. We operate the world's largest work marketplace that connects businesses with independent talent, as measured by GSV. GSV represents the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering as well as additional fees we charge to talent for other services. Talent includes independent professionals and agencies of varying sizes. The clients on our work marketplace range in size from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. With users in over 180 countries, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of determining countries where we enable GSV, we include both the countries in which the clients that paid for the applicable services are located, as well as the countries in which talent that provided those services are located.\nAs a global work marketplace that connects talent and clients regardless of their location, our GSV originates from around the world. Of the $3.5 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2021, approximately 25% was generated from U.S. talent, which is our largest talent geography in each of 2021, 2020, and 2019, as measured by GSV, while talent in India and the Philippines remained our next largest talent geographies in all three years. Of the $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2020 and 2019, respectively, approximately 25% and 27%, respectively, was generated from talent in the United States.\nApproximately 66% of our GSV in 2021 was generated from U.S. clients, compared to approximately 67% and 68% of GSV in 2020 and 2019, respectively, with clients in no other country representing more than 10% of our GSV in any year.\nWe generate revenue from both talent and clients, with a majority of our revenue generated from service fees charged to talent. We also generate revenue from fees charged to both clients and talent for other services, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, premium offerings, purchases of Connects, foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering. In addition, we provide a managed services offering where we engage talent to complete projects, directly invoice the client, and assume responsibility for work performed.\nFinancial Highlights for 2021\nIn 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We prioritized our advertising, marketing, and offering development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%, and we experienced increases in user acquisition and the number of active clients, which fueled marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, marketplace revenue increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Additionally, we increased our investment in brand marketing and to a lesser extent, our investment in sales by expanding our sales team. We generated a net loss of $56.2 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA was $19.1 million in 2021, an increase of 36% from 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions intended to prevent its spread have continued to accelerate the secular shift toward remote and independent work, and, with our unique, remote-based business model, the pandemic has not impacted our clients' access to highly-skilled talent to complete short- and long-term projects on our work marketplace. While we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business thus far from\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, we are unable to fully assess the aggregate impact it will have on our business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its effect on the economy, its impact to the businesses of our clients, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities related to the pandemic, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nKey Financial and Operational Metrics\nWe monitor the following key financial and operational metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nOur key metrics were as follows as of or for the periods presented:\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of or for the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GSV </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,546,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,523,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,087,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketplace revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>462,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>268,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketplace take rate </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(56,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(146) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active clients </td> <td>771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GSV per active client </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared under U.S. GAAP.\nAs discussed below with respect to each key metric, we believe these key financial and operational metrics are useful to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of our business and in understanding our operating results, and management uses these metrics to track our performance. For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our key financial and operational metrics, see Risk Factors-We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nGross Services Volume (GSV)\nGSV includes both client spend and additional fees charged for other services. Client spend, which we define as the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering, is the primary component of GSV. GSV also includes fees charged to talent, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, user memberships, and purchases of Connects, and foreign currency exchange.\nGSV is an important metric because it represents the amount of business transacted through our work marketplace. Our marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount talent charges clients for services accessed through our work marketplace. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. For a discussion of how we measure and evaluate the correlation between marketplace revenue and GSV, see -Marketplace Take Rate\u201d below. Growth in the number of active clients and GSV per active client are the primary drivers of GSV, and we expect the trends discussed in -Active Clients and GSV per Active Client,\u201d below, to affect the rate at which GSV grows. We derive a substantial portion of our GSV and revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses. In 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. Additionally, we have prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the pandemic. As a result, of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%. We expect our GSV to fluctuate between periods due to a\nnumber of factors, including the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our clients' businesses; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; and the volume of projects that are posted by clients on our work marketplace, the characteristics of those projects, such as size, duration, and pricing, and the availability and qualifications of talent to complete those projects.\nMarketplace Revenue\nMarketplace revenue, which represents the majority of our revenue, consists primarily of revenue derived from our Upwork Basic, Plus, and Enterprise offerings. We generate marketplace revenue from both talent and clients. Revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings are primarily comprised of talent service fees, and to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees charged to clients. Revenue from our Upwork Enterprise offering, which we refer to as Enterprise Revenue, includes all client fees, subscriptions, and talent service fees. We also generate marketplace revenue from fees for premium offerings associated with our Upwork Basic, Plus, and Enterprise offerings, including talent memberships, purchases of Connects, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering.\nMarketplace revenue is the primary driver of our business, and we believe it provides comparability to other online marketplaces. The growth rate of marketplace revenue fluctuates in relation to the growth rate of GSV. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. In 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we experienced increases in user acquisition and growth in the number of active clients, which drove an increase in talent billings, and, in turn, drove an increase in marketplace revenue. We expect our marketplace revenue growth rates to continue to vary from period to period due to a variety of other factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic impact on the businesses and spending behavior of our current and prospective clients; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; the lapping of significant launches of new products, pricing changes, and other monetization efforts; the number of active clients and their spend on our work marketplace; and the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, Upwork Enterprise clients, and the timing of those results.\nMarketplace Take Rate\nMarketplace take rate measures the correlation between marketplace revenue and marketplace GSV and is calculated by dividing marketplace revenue by marketplace GSV. Marketplace take rate is an important metric because it is the key indicator of how well we monetize spend on our work marketplace from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. More higher value relationships and higher spend per client results in a larger percentage of business activity on our work marketplace being priced at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate decreased as clients matured into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021. On the other hand, we intend to continue our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. These offerings have take rates that are higher than the rest of our business, which partially offsets the trend of lower rates as relationships and clients mature into higher value clients with increased spend. Additionally, we are working on a number of initiatives that could also have a positive impact on marketplace take rate, and we will continue to introduce new or modify existing offerings or other services and features. As a result of these efforts, over the course of 2022, we expect marketplace take rate to increase slightly. However, we also generally expect our marketplace take rate to vary from period to period as marketplace revenue and GSV vary as a result of a variety of factors, such as the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; pricing\nchanges; the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, our Upwork Enterprise clients and the timing of those results; and ongoing efforts to improve processes on our work marketplace, including project proposals and purchases of Connects, among others.\nActive Clients and GSV per Active Client\nWe define an active client as a client that has had spend activity on our work marketplace during the 12 months preceding the date of measurement. GSV per active client is calculated by dividing total GSV during the four quarters ended on the date of measurement by the number of active clients on the date of measurement. We believe that the number of active clients and GSV per active client are indicators of the growth and overall health of our business. The number of active clients is a primary driver of GSV and, in turn, marketplace revenue.\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features and prioritizing our advertising and marketing efforts to drive brand awareness and accelerate the acquisition of new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have seen continued acceleration in the growth of GSV per active client as an increasing number of clients continue to mature into higher-value clients and expand their spend on our work marketplace. As a result, our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.\nWe continue to see businesses of all sizes use our work marketplace in a recurring way for larger, more complex projects, and we expect the number of active clients and GSV per active client to continue to increase over time but could vary quarter by quarter depending, in part, on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic downturn impacts our business, the businesses of our clients, and other factors identified in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nWhile continued use of our work marketplace by talent is a factor that impacts our ability to attract and retain clients, we currently have a significant surplus of talent in relation to the number of clients actively engaging talent for most categories of services on our work marketplace. As a result of this surplus, we primarily focus our efforts on retaining client spend and acquiring new clients, as opposed to acquiring new talent and retaining existing talent. Moreover, we generate revenue when clients engage and pay talent, and therefore, our key metrics and operating results are directly impacted by client spend. Additionally, the number of talent retained between periods is merely one of many factors that may impact client spend in a particular period and is not a primary driver of our key metrics and operating results.\nCohort Analysis\nClient Spend by Annual Client Cohort\nOur growth has been driven, in significant part, by retaining client spend from existing clients as we grow our client base. As illustrated in the chart below, we have been able to retain client spend over long periods of time with clients in historical cohorts continuing to spend meaningfully on our work marketplace. A client belongs to an annual cohort based on the date of first spend activity with talent. For example, the 2016 cohort includes all clients that had their first spend activity with talent between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Since 2016, each new annual cohort's first-year spend has exceeded the first-year spend of the prior year's annual cohort. For example, for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, client spend from new client cohorts was $537.9 million, $407.9 million, and $298.8 million, respectively.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue is generated from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. Under these marketplace offerings, we generate revenue from both talent and clients. Marketplace revenue, which represents the majority of our total revenue, is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount that talent charge clients for services accessed through our work marketplace and, to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees paid by clients.\nOur Upwork Basic and Plus offerings provide clients with access to talent with verified work history and client feedback on our work marketplace, the ability to instantly match with the right talent, and built-in collaboration features. For talent working with clients that are on our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings, we have a tiered talent service fee schedule based on cumulative lifetime billings by talent to each client. Talent typically pays us 20% of the first $500, 10% for the next $9,500, and then 5% for any amount over $10,000 they bill to each client through our work marketplace. We recognize revenue on Sundays of each week for the majority of our tiered talent service fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill talent for the service fees. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from talent through membership fees, purchases of Connects, and withdrawal and other fees.\nIn addition, we generate marketplace revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings by charging clients a payment processing and administration fee. Clients using our Upwork Basic offering pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend. We recognize revenue on Mondays of each week for a substantial portion of our client fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill the fees. Clients using our Upwork Plus offering pay a flat fee of approximately $50 per month for additional features and pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend unless they pay via ACH (in which case, provided all eligibility criteria are met, the fee is waived). To a lesser extent, we also\ngenerate revenue from clients through foreign currency exchange fees when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nOur Upwork Enterprise offering, which is designed for larger clients with at least 250 employees, includes access to additional product features, premium access to top talent, professional services, custom reporting, and flexible payment terms. For our Upwork Enterprise offering, we charge clients a monthly or annual subscription fee and a service fee calculated as a percentage of the client's spend on talent services, in addition to the service fees paid by talent. Additionally, Upwork Enterprise clients can also subscribe to a compliance offering that includes worker classification services for an additional fee and may also choose to use our work marketplace to engage talent that were not originally sourced through our work marketplace for a lower fee percentage.\nOne of our premium offerings, Upwork Payroll, is available to clients when talent are classified as employees for engagements on our work marketplace. The client enters into an Upwork Payroll agreement with us, and we separately contract with unrelated third-party staffing providers that provide employment services to such clients.\nIn 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent. We intend to continue to focus on these efforts to attract new users, including large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs, as well as talent that meet the criteria sought by such clients.\nManaged Services Revenue. Through our managed services offering, we are responsible for providing services and engaging talent directly or as employees of third-party staffing providers to perform services for clients on our behalf. The talent providing services in connection with our managed services include independent talent and agencies of varying sizes. Under U.S. GAAP, we are deemed to be the principal in these managed services arrangements and therefore recognize the entire GSV of managed services projects as managed services revenue, as compared to recognizing only the percentage of the client spend that we receive, as we do with our marketplace offerings. Managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, as we primarily focused on increasing client usage of and spend on our marketplace offerings during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our managed services offering, personnel-related costs for our services and support personnel, third-party hosting fees for our use of AWS, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. We define personnel-related costs as salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and entertainment, and stock-based compensation costs for employees and the costs related to other service providers we engage.\nWe expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to higher payment processing fees, personnel-related costs, and third-party hosting fees in order to support growth on our work marketplace. Amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering are tied to the volume of managed services used by our clients. The level and timing of all of these items could fluctuate and affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may be influenced by our revenue, the mix of payment methods that our clients choose, the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, our continued investments in our services and support teams, the timing and amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. In addition, gross margin will be impacted by fluctuations in our revenue mix between marketplace revenue and managed services revenue. For example, our managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, which caused gross margin to increase. We expect gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although gross margin, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software and platform development that qualifies for capitalization. In 2021, we made significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and increase the size of our research and development workforce, and we believe continued investments in research and development are important to attain our strategic objectives. As a result, we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of expenses related to advertising and marketing activities, as well as personnel-related costs, including sales commissions, which we expense as they are incurred. In 2021, we continued evolving our offerings, products, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We made significant investments in marketing to acquire new clients and drive brand awareness, and we expect to increase these investments in 2022. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began increasing our investment in sales by expanding our sales team, and we expect this expansion to continue through 2022 as we increase our efforts to acquire clients through our Upwork Enterprise offering. As a result, we expect this expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue may vary from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and operations functions; outside consulting, legal, and accounting services; impairment expense; and insurance.\nTo achieve our strategic objectives, we expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and to incur additional general and administrative expenses, including increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements, legal and accounting costs, insurance premiums, and compliance costs. Additionally, in 2020 we shifted to a flexible work model for our workforce and are evaluating our current need for office space. As a result, we may determine to either close or sublease certain of our offices, either of which could result in further impairment charges being recognized in general and administrative expense. As a result, we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nProvision for Transaction Losses. Provision for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from fraud and bad debt expense associated with our trade and client receivables balance and transaction losses associated with chargebacks. Provisions for these items represent estimates of losses based on our actual historical incurred losses and other factors. We expect provisions for transaction losses to increase proportionally as GSV grows. As a result, we expect provision for transaction losses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although expressed as a percentage of total revenue, this expense may vary from period to period.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding borrowings.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions and interest income that we earn from our deposits in money market funds and investments in marketable securities.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision)\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in the relevant authoritative guidance. To the extent that we believe any amounts are less likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. If we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nIn addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the relevant guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our\nincome tax return, and also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluation of uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. A liability is reported for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for

to 2020.\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features, prioritizing our advertising efforts to reach new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent, and investing in marketing to accelerate the acquisition of new clients and drive brand awareness. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The growth in active clients and GSV per active client contributed to the growth of GSV and marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, GSV increased 41%, as compared to the same period in 2020. Marketplace revenue was driven by client spend, which for the year ended December 31, 2021, drove an increase in talent service fees of 36%, as compared to the same period in 2020, and an increase in client payment processing and administrative fees of 42%, as compared to the same period in 2020.\nAdditionally, in 2021, we continued our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. As a result, Enterprise Revenue increased 73% to $34.9 million, which fueled marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue and increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Marketplace revenue grew more slowly than GSV from our marketplace offerings in 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate was 13.2%, as compared to 13.6% for the same period in 2020. This trend was the result of a few factors. In particular, clients are maturing into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nManaged services revenue represented 8% and 9% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, managed services revenue increased by $5.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2020.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of cost of revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of talent services to deliver managed services </td> <td>31,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other components of cost of revenue </td> <td>103,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin </td> <td>73 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 30%, compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in payment processing fees of $23.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased client spend, as well as increases in cost of talent services to deliver managed services resulting from increases in managed services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, third-party hosting costs increased $2.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by our use of two AWS data centers during the period in connection with our migration from the AWS facility in California to the AWS facility in Oregon.\nResearch and Development\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expense increased by $35.6 million, or 43%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to our ongoing and significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and enhance the user experience. Specifically, investments we made to increase the size of our research and development workforce resulted in increases in personnel-related costs of $26.0 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in software licenses of $2.6 million, outside consultants of $1.5 million, and depreciation and other costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, due to the timing of new projects, we capitalized less internal-use software and platform development costs than we did in 2020, when we capitalized an incremental $2.4 million.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, sales and marketing expense increased by $50.1 million, or 38%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and brand awareness campaigns of $37.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in personnel-related costs of $11.1 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expense increased by $41.6 million, or 58%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of $29.5 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily because of increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements. In 2021, we incurred impairment charges of $8.7 million related to certain of our operating lease assets and associated property and equipment.\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for transaction losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, provision for transaction losses increased by $2.5 million, or 70%, as compared to 2020, and represented approximately 1% of revenue for each period.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>(279) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense increased as a result of the issuance of the Notes. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(56,240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,659) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back (deduct): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>53,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>10,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,661 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>2,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>(279) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,407) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tides Foundation common stock warrant expense </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense </td> <td>8,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,438 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (b) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (c) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury bills, corporate bonds, U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and Yankee bonds. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $187.2 million and $94.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $497.6 million and $75.6 million in marketable securities, respectively.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. In the long term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from users, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the cost to host our work marketplace, the introduction of new offerings and services, the continuing market adoption of our work marketplace, any acquisitions or investments that we make in complementary businesses, products, and technologies and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our non-cancellable operating leases for office space and the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, our future lease commitments were $26.5 million (excluding adjustments for discount to present value), including $6.6 million for 2022. For additional information about our Notes, see the section titled -Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026.\u201d\nWe anticipate satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents and may satisfy our long-term cash requirements with cash and cash equivalents on hand or with proceeds from a future equity or debt financing. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, cash from marketable securities, and cash from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) are insufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, or should we require additional cash for other purposes, we will need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements, as we did in the third quarter of 2021. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership and economic interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we will be subject to additional debt service requirements and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could also be unfavorable to our equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms we deem acceptable, or at all. The inability to raise additional capital as and when required would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe also believe that our principal sources of liquidity will allow us to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from users, as further described above in Risk Factors-Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are expected to continue to evolve. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the pandemic.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources.\nEscrow Funding Requirements\nAs a licensed internet escrow agent, we offer escrow services to users of our work marketplace and, as such, we are required to hold our users' escrowed cash and in-transit cash in trust as an asset and record a corresponding liability for escrow funds held on behalf of talent and clients on our balance sheet. We expect the balances of our funds held in escrow, including funds held in transit, and the related liability to grow as GSV grows and may vary from period to period. Escrow regulations require us to fund the trust with our operating cash to cover shortages due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings. Talent submit their billings for hourly contracts to their clients on a weekly basis every Sunday, and the aggregate amount of such billings is added to escrow funds payable to talent on the same day. As of each Sunday of each week, we have not yet collected funds for hourly billings from clients as these funds are in transit. Therefore, in order to satisfy escrow funding requirements, every Sunday we fund the shortage of cash in trust with our own operating cash and typically collect this cash shortage from clients within the next several days. As a result, we expect our total cash and cash flows from operating activities to be impacted when a quarter ends on a Sunday. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, were $160.8 million and $135.0 million, respectively.\nTerm and Revolving Loans\nIn August 2021, in connection with our issuance of the Notes, we paid off outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, as amended, which we refer to as the Loan Agreement.\nConvertible Senior Notes Due 2026\nIn August 2021, we issued the Notes pursuant to an Indenture between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the Indenture.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears, and are due August 15, 2026. Upon conversion, we have an option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $560.1 million, after deducting debt issuance costs. We used approximately $49.4 million of the net proceeds from the Notes offering to pay the cost of the Capped Calls. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including marketing, brand awareness and sales, and which may include working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that we may identify in the future. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes.\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nThe initial cap price of the Capped Calls is $92.74 per share of common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes and the Capped Calls.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(428,980) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100,924) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>537,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,464) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes increases in funds held in escrow, including funds in transit of $25.8 million, $26.3 million, and $10.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash from operating activities is revenue generated from our work marketplace. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, marketing activities, including advertising, payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our managed services offering, and third-party hosting costs. In addition, because we are licensed as an internet escrow agent, our total cash and cash provided by operating activities may be impacted by the timing of the end of our fiscal quarter as discussed in the section titled -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Escrow Funding Requirements.\u201d\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was $10.8 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $83.5 million, offset by a net loss of $56.2 million and net cash outflows of $16.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables. Due to fluctuations in revenue and the number of transactions on our platform, coupled with fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts from clients, our trade and client receivables will likely continue to fluctuate in the future.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was $22.4 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $43.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.2 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset by a net loss of $22.9 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from changes in trade and client receivables, accrued expenses, and other current and long-term liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $1.1 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $32.2 million, offset by a net loss of $16.7 million and net cash outflows of $14.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables of $10.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2021 was $429.0 million, which was primarily a result of investing $525.3 million in various marketable securities, as well as $5.1 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2020 was $4.1 million, which was primarily a result of investing $107.3 million in various marketable securities during 2020, as well as $8.0 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $6.3 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our office lease in Chicago, Illinois. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $117.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2019 was $100.9 million, which was primarily a result of investing $168.8 million in various marketable securities during 2019, as well as $5.9 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $10.8 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our new office leases in Santa Clara, California and Chicago, Illinois. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $84.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was $537.7 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds from the Notes, net of debt issuance costs of $560.1 million, an increase in escrow funds payable of $25.8 million,\ncash received from stock option exercises of $7.2 million, and proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $4.8 million, partially offset by purchases of the Capped Calls of $49.4 million and repayments of borrowings on debt of $10.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was $54.6 million, which resulted primarily from cash received from stock option exercises of $31.0 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase program of $4.9 million, and an increase in escrow funds payable of $26.3 million, partially offset by net repayments of debt of $7.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was $29.4 million, which resulted primarily from cash received from stock option exercises of $18.2 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase program of $6.4 million, and an increase in escrow funds payable of $10.5 million, partially offset by net repayments of debt of $5.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgement than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily generate revenue from talent and clients from marketplace and managed service offerings. We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on December 31, 2019 effective as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to users in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services.\nDetermining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires management to make judgments and estimates. Judgments include determining whether to present revenue gross, as a principal, or net, as an agent, which is based on an evaluation of whether we control the service prior to it being transferred to the client, and certain aspects of applying Topic 606 to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees.\nWe apply judgement in the application of the portfolio approach practical expedient to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees, which includes estimating the standalone selling price of the material rights and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. Specifically, management applies judgement in assessing the continued appropriateness for the estimates, which include assessing the continued appropriateness of the methodology and relevant data inputs to estimate the likelihood and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. We utilize historical user transaction data in developing these estimates. We recognize revenue related to the material rights based on our estimate of when the material rights are exercised, and adjust revenue for changes in estimates in the period of change on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to service providers, including stock options, RSUs, performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and purchase rights granted under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the 2018 ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the estimated fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rates, and the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards. The fair value and derived service period of stock options with market-based conditions is estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model. We evaluate the assumptions used to value option awards upon each grant of stock options. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined using the closing common stock price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of PSUs that are probable of being earned as of the grant date. We use the quoted market price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the fair value of RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and purchase rights under our 2018 ESPP. We generally recognize the fair value of stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the period during which a service provider is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period and\naccount for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense associated with service- and market-based stock options is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the service condition and market condition. Stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the performance condition and the service condition.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under current tax law. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess, among other things, the historical levels of income and various sources of taxable income. We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report.", "item_7_truncated": "Marketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue is generated from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. Under these marketplace offerings, we generate revenue from both talent and clients. Marketplace revenue, which represents the majority of our total revenue, is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount that talent charge clients for services accessed through our work marketplace and, to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees paid by clients.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in the relevant authoritative guidance. To the extent that we believe any amounts are less likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. If we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software and platform development that qualifies for capitalization. In 2021, we made significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and increase the size of our research and development workforce, and we believe continued investments in research and development are important to attain our strategic objectives. As a result, we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for transaction losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes.

The talent providing services in connection with our managed services include independent talent and agencies of varying sizes. Under U.S. GAAP, we are deemed to be the principal in these managed services arrangements and therefore recognize the entire GSV of managed services projects as managed services revenue, as compared to recognizing only the percentage of the client spend that we receive, as we do with our marketplace offerings. Managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, as we primarily focused on increasing client usage of and spend on our marketplace offerings during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(428,980) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100,924) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>537,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,464) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes increases in funds held in escrow, including funds in transit of $25.8 million, $26.3 million, and $10.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total revenue </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace Take Rate\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nClient Spend by Annual Client Cohort\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2019 was $100.9 million, which was primarily a result of investing $168.8 million in various marketable securities during 2019, as well as $5.9 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $10.8 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our new office leases in Santa Clara, California and Chicago, Illinois.

The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables. Due to fluctuations in revenue and the number of transactions on our platform, coupled with fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts from clients, our trade and client receivables will likely continue to fluctuate in the future.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of cost of revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of talent services to deliver managed services </td> <td>31,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other components of cost of revenue </td> <td>103,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin </td> <td>73 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\naccount for forfeitures as they occur.

We generate marketplace revenue from both talent and clients. Revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings are primarily comprised of talent service fees, and to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees charged to clients. Revenue from our Upwork Enterprise offering, which we refer to as Enterprise Revenue, includes all client fees, subscriptions, and talent service fees. We also generate marketplace revenue from fees for premium offerings associated with our Upwork Basic, Plus, and Enterprise offerings, including talent memberships, purchases of Connects, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering.\nCohort Analysis\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections titled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that may never materialize or that may be proven incorrect. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the sections titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report.\nIn August 2021, in connection with our issuance of the Notes, we paid off outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, as amended, which we refer to as the Loan Agreement.\nProvision for Transaction Losses. Provision for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from fraud and bad debt expense associated with our trade and client receivables balance and transaction losses associated with chargebacks. Provisions for these items represent estimates of losses based on our actual historical incurred losses and other factors. We expect provisions for transaction losses to increase proportionally as GSV grows. As a result, we expect provision for transaction losses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although expressed as a percentage of total revenue, this expense may vary from period to period.\nWe anticipate satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents and may satisfy our long-term cash requirements with cash and cash equivalents on hand or with proceeds from a future equity or debt financing. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, cash from marketable securities, and cash from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) are insufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, or should we require additional cash for other purposes, we will need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements, as we did in the third quarter of 2021. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership and economic interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we will be subject to additional debt service requirements and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could also be unfavorable to our equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms we deem acceptable, or at all. The inability to raise additional capital as and when required would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to achieve our business objectives.\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, client spend from new client cohorts was $537.9 million, $407.9 million, and $298.8 million, respectively.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgement than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net\nWe expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to higher payment processing fees, personnel-related costs, and third-party hosting fees in order to support growth on our work marketplace. Amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering are tied to the volume of managed services used by our clients. The level and timing of all of these items could fluctuate and affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $1.1 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $32.2 million, offset by a net loss of $16.7 million and net cash outflows of $14.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables of $10.9 million.\ngenerate revenue from clients through foreign currency exchange fees when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources.\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and\nOur growth has been driven, in significant part, by retaining client spend from existing clients as we grow our client base. As illustrated in the chart below, we have been able to retain client spend over long periods of time with clients in historical cohorts continuing to spend meaningfully on our work marketplace. A client belongs to an annual cohort based on the date of first spend activity with talent. For example, the 2016 cohort includes all clients that had their first spend activity with talent between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Since 2016, each new annual cohort's first-year spend has exceeded the first-year spend of the prior year's annual cohort. For example, for the\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (b) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (c) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\nAdditionally, in 2021, we continued our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. As a result, Enterprise Revenue increased 73% to $34.9 million, which fueled marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue and increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Marketplace revenue grew more slowly than GSV from our marketplace offerings in 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate was 13.2%, as compared to 13.6% for the same period in 2020. This trend was the result of a few factors. In particular, clients are maturing into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nManaged services revenue represented 8% and 9% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, managed services revenue increased by $5.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was $22.4 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $43.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.2 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset by a net loss of $22.9 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from changes in trade and client receivables, accrued expenses, and other current and long-term liabilities.\nWe primarily generate revenue from talent and clients from marketplace and managed service offerings. We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on December 31, 2019 effective as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to users in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services.\nIn August 2021, we issued the Notes pursuant to an Indenture between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the Indenture.\nIn 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We prioritized our advertising, marketing, and offering development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%, and we experienced increases in user acquisition and the number of active clients, which fueled marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, marketplace revenue increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Additionally, we increased our investment in brand marketing and to a lesser extent, our investment in sales by expanding our sales team. We generated a net loss of $56.2 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA was $19.1 million in 2021, an increase of 36% from 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA.\nWhile continued use of our work marketplace by talent is a factor that impacts our ability to attract and retain clients, we currently have a significant surplus of talent in relation to the number of clients actively engaging talent for most categories of services on our work marketplace. As a result of this surplus, we primarily focus our efforts on retaining client spend and acquiring new clients, as opposed to acquiring new talent and retaining existing talent. Moreover, we generate revenue when clients engage and pay talent, and therefore, our key metrics and operating results are directly impacted by client spend. Additionally, the number of talent retained between periods is merely one of many factors that may impact client spend in a particular period and is not a primary driver of our key metrics and operating results.\nBusiness\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of expenses related to advertising and marketing activities, as well as personnel-related costs, including sales commissions, which we expense as they are incurred. In 2021, we continued evolving our offerings, products, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We made significant investments in marketing to acquire new clients and drive brand awareness, and we expect to increase these investments in 2022. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began increasing our investment in sales by expanding our sales team, and we expect this expansion to continue through 2022 as we increase our efforts to acquire clients through our Upwork Enterprise offering. As a result, we expect this expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue may vary from period to period.\nAs discussed below with respect to each key metric, we believe these key financial and operational metrics are useful to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of our business and in understanding our operating results, and management uses these metrics to track our performance. For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our key financial and operational metrics, see Risk Factors-We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expense increased by $41.6 million, or 58%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of $29.5 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily because of increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements. In 2021, we incurred impairment charges of $8.7 million related to certain of our operating lease assets and associated property and equipment.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2020 was $4.1 million, which was primarily a result of investing $107.3 million in various marketable securities during 2020, as well as $8.0 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $6.3 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our office lease in Chicago, Illinois. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $117.5 million.\nIn addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the relevant guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our\n\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nKey Financial and Operational Metrics\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision)\n\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. In the long term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from users, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the cost to host our work marketplace, the introduction of new offerings and services, the continuing market adoption of our work marketplace, any acquisitions or investments that we make in complementary businesses, products, and technologies and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our non-cancellable operating leases for office space and the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, our future lease commitments were $26.5 million (excluding adjustments for discount to present value), including $6.6 million for 2022. For additional information about our Notes, see the section titled -Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\nWe monitor the following key financial and operational metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nIn addition, we generate marketplace revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings by charging clients a payment processing and administration fee. Clients using our Upwork Basic offering pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend. We recognize revenue on Mondays of each week for a substantial portion of our client fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill the fees. Clients using our Upwork Plus offering pay a flat fee of approximately $50 per month for additional features and pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend unless they pay via ACH (in which case, provided all eligibility criteria are met, the fee is waived). To a lesser extent, we also\nIndependent talent is an increasingly sought-after, critical, and expanding segment of the global workforce. We operate the world's largest work marketplace that connects businesses with independent talent, as measured by GSV. GSV represents the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering as well as additional fees we charge to talent for other services. Talent includes independent professionals and agencies of varying sizes. The clients on our work marketplace range in size from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. With users in over 180 countries, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of determining countries where we enable GSV, we include both the countries in which the clients that paid for the applicable services are located, as well as the countries in which talent that provided those services are located.\nSee Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDetermining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires management to make judgments and estimates. Judgments include determining whether to present revenue gross, as a principal, or net, as an agent, which is based on an evaluation of whether we control the service prior to it being transferred to the client, and certain aspects of applying Topic 606 to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees.\nWe apply judgement in the application of the portfolio approach practical expedient to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees, which includes estimating the standalone selling price of the material rights and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. Specifically, management applies judgement in assessing the continued appropriateness for the estimates, which include assessing the continued appropriateness of the methodology and relevant data inputs to estimate the likelihood and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. We utilize historical user transaction data in developing these estimates. We recognize revenue related to the material rights based on our estimate of when the material rights are exercised, and adjust revenue for changes in estimates in the period of change on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nOur key metrics were as follows as of or for the periods presented:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expense increased by $35.6 million, or 43%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to our ongoing and significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and enhance the user experience. Specifically, investments we made to increase the size of our research and development workforce resulted in increases in personnel-related costs of $26.0 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in software licenses of $2.6 million, outside consultants of $1.5 million, and depreciation and other costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, due to the timing of new projects, we capitalized less internal-use software and platform development costs than we did in 2020, when we capitalized an incremental $2.4 million.\nGSV is an important metric because it represents the amount of business transacted through our work marketplace. Our marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount talent charges clients for services accessed through our work marketplace. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. For a discussion of how we measure and evaluate the correlation between marketplace revenue and GSV, see -Marketplace Take Rate\u201d below. Growth in the number of active clients and GSV per active client are the primary drivers of GSV, and we expect the trends discussed in -Active Clients and GSV per Active Client,\u201d below, to affect the rate at which GSV grows. We derive a substantial portion of our GSV and revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses. In 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. Additionally, we have prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the pandemic. As a result, of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%. We expect our GSV to fluctuate between periods due to a\nAs a global work marketplace that connects talent and clients regardless of their location, our GSV originates from around the world. Of the $3.5 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2021, approximately 25% was generated from U.S. talent, which is our largest talent geography in each of 2021, 2020, and 2019, as measured by GSV, while talent in India and the Philippines remained our next largest talent geographies in all three years. Of the $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2020 and 2019, respectively, approximately 25% and 27%, respectively, was generated from talent in the United States.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total revenue was $502.8 million, representing an increase of $129.2 million, or 35%, as compared to 2020.\n\nApproximately 66% of our GSV in 2021 was generated from U.S. clients, compared to approximately 67% and 68% of GSV in 2020 and 2019, respectively, with clients in no other country representing more than 10% of our GSV in any year.\nGross Services Volume (GSV)\nIn 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent. We intend to continue to focus on these efforts to attract new users, including large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs, as well as talent that meet the criteria sought by such clients.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nWe define an active client as a client that has had spend activity on our work marketplace during the 12 months preceding the date of measurement. GSV per active client is calculated by dividing total GSV during the four quarters ended on the date of measurement by the number of active clients on the date of measurement. We believe that the number of active clients and GSV per active client are indicators of the growth and overall health of our business. The number of active clients is a primary driver of GSV and, in turn, marketplace revenue.\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 30%, compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in payment processing fees of $23.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased client spend, as well as increases in cost of talent services to deliver managed services resulting from increases in managed services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, for\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features and prioritizing our advertising and marketing efforts to drive brand awareness and accelerate the acquisition of new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have seen continued acceleration in the growth of GSV per active client as an increasing number of clients continue to mature into higher-value clients and expand their spend on our work marketplace. As a result, our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, sales and marketing expense increased by $50.1 million, or 38%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and brand awareness campaigns of $37.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in personnel-related costs of $11.1 million.\ncash received from stock option exercises of $7.2 million, and proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $4.8 million, partially offset by purchases of the Capped Calls of $49.4 million and repayments of borrowings on debt of $10.8 million.\nMarketplace Revenue\nOur Upwork Enterprise offering, which is designed for larger clients with at least 250 employees, includes access to additional product features, premium access to top talent, professional services, custom reporting, and flexible payment terms. For our Upwork Enterprise offering, we charge clients a monthly or annual subscription fee and a service fee calculated as a percentage of the client's spend on talent services, in addition to the service fees paid by talent. Additionally, Upwork Enterprise clients can also subscribe to a compliance offering that includes worker classification services for an additional fee and may also choose to use our work marketplace to engage talent that were not originally sourced through our work marketplace for a lower fee percentage.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nResearch and Development\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.\nGSV includes both client spend and additional fees charged for other services. Client spend, which we define as the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering, is the primary component of GSV. GSV also includes fees charged to talent, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, user memberships, and purchases of Connects, and foreign currency exchange.\nEscrow Funding Requirements\nOur Upwork Basic and Plus offerings provide clients with access to talent with verified work history and client feedback on our work marketplace, the ability to instantly match with the right talent, and built-in collaboration features. For talent working with clients that are on our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings, we have a tiered talent service fee schedule based on cumulative lifetime billings by talent to each client. Talent typically pays us 20% of the first $500, 10% for the next $9,500, and then 5% for any amount over $10,000 they bill to each client through our work marketplace. We recognize revenue on Sundays of each week for the majority of our tiered talent service fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill talent for the service fees. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from talent through membership fees, purchases of Connects, and withdrawal and other fees.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nFinancial Highlights for 2021\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\nWe utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under current tax law. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess, among other things, the historical levels of income and various sources of taxable income. We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features, prioritizing our advertising efforts to reach new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent, and investing in marketing to accelerate the acquisition of new clients and drive brand awareness. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The growth in active clients and GSV per active client contributed to the growth of GSV and marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, GSV increased 41%, as compared to the same period in 2020. Marketplace revenue was driven by client spend, which for the year ended December 31, 2021, drove an increase in talent service fees of 36%, as compared to the same period in 2020, and an increase in client payment processing and administrative fees of 42%, as compared to the same period in 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and operations functions; outside consulting, legal, and accounting services; impairment expense; and insurance.\nActive Clients and GSV per Active Client\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions and interest income that we earn from our deposits in money market funds and investments in marketable securities.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operation,\u201d included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nOverview\nGross Profit and Gross Margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may be influenced by our revenue, the mix of payment methods that our clients choose, the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, our continued investments in our services and support teams, the timing and amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. In addition, gross margin will be impacted by fluctuations in our revenue mix between marketplace revenue and managed services revenue. For example, our managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, which caused gross margin to increase. We expect gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although gross margin, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCapped Calls\nGeneral and Administrative\nMarketplace take rate measures the correlation between marketplace revenue and marketplace GSV and is calculated by dividing marketplace revenue by marketplace GSV. Marketplace take rate is an important metric because it is the key indicator of how well we monetize spend on our work marketplace from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. More higher value relationships and higher spend per client results in a larger percentage of business activity on our work marketplace being priced at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate decreased as clients matured into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021. On the other hand, we intend to continue our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. These offerings have take rates that are higher than the rest of our business, which partially offsets the trend of lower rates as relationships and clients mature into higher value clients with increased spend. Additionally, we are working on a number of initiatives that could also have a positive impact on marketplace take rate, and we will continue to introduce new or modify existing offerings or other services and features. As a result of these efforts, over the course of 2022, we expect marketplace take rate to increase slightly. However, we also generally expect our marketplace take rate to vary from period to period as marketplace revenue and GSV vary as a result of a variety of factors, such as the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; pricing\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to service providers, including stock options, RSUs, performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and purchase rights granted under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the 2018 ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the estimated fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rates, and the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards. The fair value and derived service period of stock options with market-based conditions is estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model. We evaluate the assumptions used to value option awards upon each grant of stock options. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined using the closing common stock price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of PSUs that are probable of being earned as of the grant date. We use the quoted market price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the fair value of RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and purchase rights under our 2018 ESPP. We generally recognize the fair value of stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the period during which a service provider is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period and\nTerm and Revolving Loans\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2021 was $429.0 million, which was primarily a result of investing $525.3 million in various marketable securities, as well as $5.1 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nAs a licensed internet escrow agent, we offer escrow services to users of our work marketplace and, as such, we are required to hold our users' escrowed cash and in-transit cash in trust as an asset and record a corresponding liability for escrow funds held on behalf of talent and clients on our balance sheet. We expect the balances of our funds held in escrow, including funds held in transit, and the related liability to grow as GSV grows and may vary from period to period. Escrow regulations require us to fund the trust with our operating cash to cover shortages due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings. Talent submit their billings for hourly contracts to their clients on a weekly basis every Sunday, and the aggregate amount of such billings is added to escrow funds payable to talent on the same day. As of each Sunday of each week, we have not yet collected funds for hourly billings from clients as these funds are in transit. Therefore, in order to satisfy escrow funding requirements, every Sunday we fund the shortage of cash in trust with our own operating cash and typically collect this cash shortage from clients within the next several days. As a result, we expect our total cash and cash flows from operating activities to be impacted when a quarter ends on a Sunday. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, were $160.8 million and $135.0 million, respectively.\n\nConvertible Senior Notes Due 2026\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash from operating activities is revenue generated from our work marketplace. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, marketing activities, including advertising, payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our managed services offering, and third-party hosting costs. In addition, because we are licensed as an internet escrow agent, our total cash and cash provided by operating activities may be impacted by the timing of the end of our fiscal quarter as discussed in the section titled -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Escrow Funding Requirements.\u201d\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTo achieve our strategic objectives, we expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and to incur additional general and administrative expenses, including increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements, legal and accounting costs, insurance premiums, and compliance costs. Additionally, in 2020 we shifted to a flexible work model for our workforce and are evaluating our current need for office space. As a result, we may determine to either close or sublease certain of our offices, either of which could result in further impairment charges being recognized in general and administrative expense. As a result, we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nWe generate revenue from both talent and clients, with a majority of our revenue generated from service fees charged to talent. We also generate revenue from fees charged to both clients and talent for other services, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, premium offerings, purchases of Connects, foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering. In addition, we provide a managed services offering where we engage talent to complete projects, directly invoice the client, and assume responsibility for work performed.\nMarketplace revenue is the primary driver of our business, and we believe it provides comparability to other online marketplaces. The growth rate of marketplace revenue fluctuates in relation to the growth rate of GSV. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. In 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we experienced increases in user acquisition and growth in the number of active clients, which drove an increase in talent billings, and, in turn, drove an increase in marketplace revenue. We expect our marketplace revenue growth rates to continue to vary from period to period due to a variety of other factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic impact on the businesses and spending behavior of our current and prospective clients; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; the lapping of significant launches of new products, pricing changes, and other monetization efforts; the number of active clients and their spend on our work marketplace; and the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, Upwork Enterprise clients, and the timing of those results.\nRevenue \nincome tax return, and also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluation of uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. A liability is reported for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding borrowings.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nWe continue to see businesses of all sizes use our work marketplace in a recurring way for larger, more complex projects, and we expect the number of active clients and GSV per active client to continue to increase over time but could vary quarter by quarter depending, in part, on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic downturn impacts our business, the businesses of our clients, and other factors identified in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nFinancing Activities\nThe initial cap price of the Capped Calls is $92.74 per share of common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes and the Capped Calls.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was $29.4 million, which resulted primarily from cash received from stock option exercises of $18.2 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase program of $6.4 million, and an increase in escrow funds payable of $10.5 million, partially offset by net repayments of debt of $5.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was $537.7 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds from the Notes, net of debt issuance costs of $560.1 million, an increase in escrow funds payable of $25.8 million,\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, third-party hosting costs increased $2.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by our use of two AWS data centers during the period in connection with our migration from the AWS facility in California to the AWS facility in Oregon.\nInvesting Activities\nWe also believe that our principal sources of liquidity will allow us to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from users, as further described above in Risk Factors-Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are expected to continue to evolve. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the pandemic.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, we are unable to fully assess the aggregate impact it will have on our business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its effect on the economy, its impact to the businesses of our clients, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities related to the pandemic, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nOne of our premium offerings, Upwork Payroll, is available to clients when talent are classified as employees for engagements on our work marketplace. The client enters into an Upwork Payroll agreement with us, and we separately contract with unrelated third-party staffing providers that provide employment services to such clients.\nSales and Marketing\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears, and are due August 15, 2026. Upon conversion, we have an option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $560.1 million, after deducting debt issuance costs. We used approximately $49.4 million of the net proceeds from the Notes offering to pay the cost of the Capped Calls. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including marketing, brand awareness and sales, and which may include working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that we may identify in the future. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nchanges; the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, our Upwork Enterprise clients and the timing of those results; and ongoing efforts to improve processes on our work marketplace, including project proposals and purchases of Connects, among others.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions intended to prevent its spread have continued to accelerate the secular shift toward remote and independent work, and, with our unique, remote-based business model, the pandemic has not impacted our clients' access to highly-skilled talent to complete short- and long-term projects on our work marketplace. While we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business thus far from\nInterest Expense", "item_7_text": "Marketplace Revenue. Marketplace revenue is generated from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. Under these marketplace offerings, we generate revenue from both talent and clients. Marketplace revenue, which represents the majority of our total revenue, is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount that talent charge clients for services accessed through our work marketplace and, to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees paid by clients.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in the relevant authoritative guidance. To the extent that we believe any amounts are less likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. If we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software and platform development that qualifies for capitalization. In 2021, we made significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and increase the size of our research and development workforce, and we believe continued investments in research and development are important to attain our strategic objectives. As a result, we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury bills, corporate bonds, U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and Yankee bonds. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $187.2 million and $94.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $497.6 million and $75.6 million in marketable securities, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nRevenue\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was $54.6 million, which resulted primarily from cash received from stock option exercises of $31.0 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase program of $4.9 million, and an increase in escrow funds payable of $26.3 million, partially offset by net repayments of debt of $7.6 million.\n\nManaged Services Revenue. Through our managed services offering, we are responsible for providing services and engaging talent directly or as employees of third-party staffing providers to perform services for clients on our behalf. The talent providing services in connection with our managed services include independent talent and agencies of varying sizes. Under U.S. GAAP, we are deemed to be the principal in these managed services arrangements and therefore recognize the entire GSV of managed services projects as managed services revenue, as compared to recognizing only the percentage of the client spend that we receive, as we do with our marketplace offerings. Managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, as we primarily focused on increasing client usage of and spend on our marketplace offerings during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nMarketplace Take Rate\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nClient Spend by Annual Client Cohort\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2019 was $100.9 million, which was primarily a result of investing $168.8 million in various marketable securities during 2019, as well as $5.9 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $10.8 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our new office leases in Santa Clara, California and Chicago, Illinois. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $84.5 million.\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our managed services offering, personnel-related costs for our services and support personnel, third-party hosting fees for our use of AWS, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. We define personnel-related costs as salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and entertainment, and stock-based compensation costs for employees and the costs related to other service providers we engage.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, provision for transaction losses increased by $2.5 million, or 70%, as compared to 2020, and represented approximately 1% of revenue for each period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense increased as a result of the issuance of the Notes. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was $10.8 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $83.5 million, offset by a net loss of $56.2 million and net cash outflows of $16.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables. Due to fluctuations in revenue and the number of transactions on our platform, coupled with fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts from clients, our trade and client receivables will likely continue to fluctuate in the future.\naccount for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense associated with service- and market-based stock options is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the service condition and market condition. Stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the performance condition and the service condition.\nnumber of factors, including the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our clients' businesses; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; and the volume of projects that are posted by clients on our work marketplace, the characteristics of those projects, such as size, duration, and pricing, and the availability and qualifications of talent to complete those projects.\nMarketplace revenue, which represents the majority of our revenue, consists primarily of revenue derived from our Upwork Basic, Plus, and Enterprise offerings. We generate marketplace revenue from both talent and clients. Revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings are primarily comprised of talent service fees, and to a lesser extent, payment processing and administration fees charged to clients. Revenue from our Upwork Enterprise offering, which we refer to as Enterprise Revenue, includes all client fees, subscriptions, and talent service fees. We also generate marketplace revenue from fees for premium offerings associated with our Upwork Basic, Plus, and Enterprise offerings, including talent memberships, purchases of Connects, and other services, such as foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering.\nCohort Analysis\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections titled Business\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that may never materialize or that may be proven incorrect. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the sections titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report.\nIn August 2021, in connection with our issuance of the Notes, we paid off outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, as amended, which we refer to as the Loan Agreement.\nProvision for Transaction Losses. Provision for transaction losses consists primarily of losses resulting from fraud and bad debt expense associated with our trade and client receivables balance and transaction losses associated with chargebacks. Provisions for these items represent estimates of losses based on our actual historical incurred losses and other factors. We expect provisions for transaction losses to increase proportionally as GSV grows. As a result, we expect provision for transaction losses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although expressed as a percentage of total revenue, this expense may vary from period to period.\nWe anticipate satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents and may satisfy our long-term cash requirements with cash and cash equivalents on hand or with proceeds from a future equity or debt financing. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, cash from marketable securities, and cash from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) are insufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, or should we require additional cash for other purposes, we will need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements, as we did in the third quarter of 2021. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership and economic interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we will be subject to additional debt service requirements and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could also be unfavorable to our equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms we deem acceptable, or at all. The inability to raise additional capital as and when required would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to achieve our business objectives.\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, client spend from new client cohorts was $537.9 million, $407.9 million, and $298.8 million, respectively.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgement than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.\nInterest Expense and Other Income, Net\nWe expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to higher payment processing fees, personnel-related costs, and third-party hosting fees in order to support growth on our work marketplace. Amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering are tied to the volume of managed services used by our clients. The level and timing of all of these items could fluctuate and affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $1.1 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $32.2 million, offset by a net loss of $16.7 million and net cash outflows of $14.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in trade and client receivables of $10.9 million.\ngenerate revenue from clients through foreign currency exchange fees when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources.\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and\nOur growth has been driven, in significant part, by retaining client spend from existing clients as we grow our client base. As illustrated in the chart below, we have been able to retain client spend over long periods of time with clients in historical cohorts continuing to spend meaningfully on our work marketplace. A client belongs to an annual cohort based on the date of first spend activity with talent. For example, the 2016 cohort includes all clients that had their first spend activity with talent between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Since 2016, each new annual cohort's first-year spend has exceeded the first-year spend of the prior year's annual cohort. For example, for the\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income.\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (b) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (c) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\nAdditionally, in 2021, we continued our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. As a result, Enterprise Revenue increased 73% to $34.9 million, which fueled marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Marketplace revenue represented 92% of total revenue and increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Marketplace revenue grew more slowly than GSV from our marketplace offerings in 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate was 13.2%, as compared to 13.6% for the same period in 2020. This trend was the result of a few factors. In particular, clients are maturing into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nManaged services revenue represented 8% and 9% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, managed services revenue increased by $5.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was $22.4 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $43.0 million and net cash inflows of $2.2 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset by a net loss of $22.9 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from changes in trade and client receivables, accrued expenses, and other current and long-term liabilities.\nWe primarily generate revenue from talent and clients from marketplace and managed service offerings. We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on December 31, 2019 effective as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to users in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services.\nIn August 2021, we issued the Notes pursuant to an Indenture between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the Indenture.\nIn 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We prioritized our advertising, marketing, and offering development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%, and we experienced increases in user acquisition and the number of active clients, which fueled marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, marketplace revenue increased by $124.2 million, or 37%, compared to 2020. Additionally, we increased our investment in brand marketing and to a lesser extent, our investment in sales by expanding our sales team. We generated a net loss of $56.2 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA was $19.1 million in 2021, an increase of 36% from 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA.\nWhile continued use of our work marketplace by talent is a factor that impacts our ability to attract and retain clients, we currently have a significant surplus of talent in relation to the number of clients actively engaging talent for most categories of services on our work marketplace. As a result of this surplus, we primarily focus our efforts on retaining client spend and acquiring new clients, as opposed to acquiring new talent and retaining existing talent. Moreover, we generate revenue when clients engage and pay talent, and therefore, our key metrics and operating results are directly impacted by client spend. Additionally, the number of talent retained between periods is merely one of many factors that may impact client spend in a particular period and is not a primary driver of our key metrics and operating results.\nBusiness\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of expenses related to advertising and marketing activities, as well as personnel-related costs, including sales commissions, which we expense as they are incurred. In 2021, we continued evolving our offerings, products, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. We made significant investments in marketing to acquire new clients and drive brand awareness, and we expect to increase these investments in 2022. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began increasing our investment in sales by expanding our sales team, and we expect this expansion to continue through 2022 as we increase our efforts to acquire clients through our Upwork Enterprise offering. As a result, we expect this expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue may vary from period to period.\nAs discussed below with respect to each key metric, we believe these key financial and operational metrics are useful to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of our business and in understanding our operating results, and management uses these metrics to track our performance. For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our key financial and operational metrics, see Risk Factors-We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics may not accurately reflect certain details of our business, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expense increased by $41.6 million, or 58%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs of $29.5 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily because of increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements. In 2021, we incurred impairment charges of $8.7 million related to certain of our operating lease assets and associated property and equipment.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2020 was $4.1 million, which was primarily a result of investing $107.3 million in various marketable securities during 2020, as well as $8.0 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $6.3 million primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture related to our office lease in Chicago, Illinois. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $117.5 million.\nIn addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on an estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the relevant guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our\n\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful in evaluating our operating performance.\nKey Financial and Operational Metrics\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision)\n\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations (in periods in which we generate cash flow from operations) will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. In the long term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from users, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the cost to host our work marketplace, the introduction of new offerings and services, the continuing market adoption of our work marketplace, any acquisitions or investments that we make in complementary businesses, products, and technologies and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our non-cancellable operating leases for office space and the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, our future lease commitments were $26.5 million (excluding adjustments for discount to present value), including $6.6 million for 2022. For additional information about our Notes, see the section titled -Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\nWe monitor the following key financial and operational metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nIn addition, we generate marketplace revenue from our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings by charging clients a payment processing and administration fee. Clients using our Upwork Basic offering pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend. We recognize revenue on Mondays of each week for a substantial portion of our client fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill the fees. Clients using our Upwork Plus offering pay a flat fee of approximately $50 per month for additional features and pay a fee equal to 3% of their client spend unless they pay via ACH (in which case, provided all eligibility criteria are met, the fee is waived). To a lesser extent, we also\nIndependent talent is an increasingly sought-after, critical, and expanding segment of the global workforce. We operate the world's largest work marketplace that connects businesses with independent talent, as measured by GSV. GSV represents the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering as well as additional fees we charge to talent for other services. Talent includes independent professionals and agencies of varying sizes. The clients on our work marketplace range in size from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. With users in over 180 countries, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of determining countries where we enable GSV, we include both the countries in which the clients that paid for the applicable services are located, as well as the countries in which talent that provided those services are located.\nSee Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDetermining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires management to make judgments and estimates. Judgments include determining whether to present revenue gross, as a principal, or net, as an agent, which is based on an evaluation of whether we control the service prior to it being transferred to the client, and certain aspects of applying Topic 606 to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees.\nWe apply judgement in the application of the portfolio approach practical expedient to our arrangements with talent subject to tiered service fees, which includes estimating the standalone selling price of the material rights and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. Specifically, management applies judgement in assessing the continued appropriateness for the estimates, which include assessing the continued appropriateness of the methodology and relevant data inputs to estimate the likelihood and the period of time over which to defer and recognize the consideration allocated to the material rights. We utilize historical user transaction data in developing these estimates. We recognize revenue related to the material rights based on our estimate of when the material rights are exercised, and adjust revenue for changes in estimates in the period of change on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nOur key metrics were as follows as of or for the periods presented:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expense increased by $35.6 million, or 43%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to our ongoing and significant investments to build new product features, launch new offerings, and enhance the user experience. Specifically, investments we made to increase the size of our research and development workforce resulted in increases in personnel-related costs of $26.0 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in software licenses of $2.6 million, outside consultants of $1.5 million, and depreciation and other costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, due to the timing of new projects, we capitalized less internal-use software and platform development costs than we did in 2020, when we capitalized an incremental $2.4 million.\nGSV is an important metric because it represents the amount of business transacted through our work marketplace. Our marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of the service fees paid by talent as a percentage of the total amount talent charges clients for services accessed through our work marketplace. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. For a discussion of how we measure and evaluate the correlation between marketplace revenue and GSV, see -Marketplace Take Rate\u201d below. Growth in the number of active clients and GSV per active client are the primary drivers of GSV, and we expect the trends discussed in -Active Clients and GSV per Active Client,\u201d below, to affect the rate at which GSV grows. We derive a substantial portion of our GSV and revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses. In 2021, we continued to evolve our offerings, brand positioning, and marketing to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs. Additionally, we have prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the pandemic. As a result, of these efforts, our work marketplace enabled $3.5 billion of GSV in 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 41%. We expect our GSV to fluctuate between periods due to a\nAs a global work marketplace that connects talent and clients regardless of their location, our GSV originates from around the world. Of the $3.5 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2021, approximately 25% was generated from U.S. talent, which is our largest talent geography in each of 2021, 2020, and 2019, as measured by GSV, while talent in India and the Philippines remained our next largest talent geographies in all three years. Of the $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion of GSV enabled on our work marketplace in 2020 and 2019, respectively, approximately 25% and 27%, respectively, was generated from talent in the United States.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total revenue was $502.8 million, representing an increase of $129.2 million, or 35%, as compared to 2020.\n\nApproximately 66% of our GSV in 2021 was generated from U.S. clients, compared to approximately 67% and 68% of GSV in 2020 and 2019, respectively, with clients in no other country representing more than 10% of our GSV in any year.\nGross Services Volume (GSV)\nIn 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent. We intend to continue to focus on these efforts to attract new users, including large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs, as well as talent that meet the criteria sought by such clients.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nWe define an active client as a client that has had spend activity on our work marketplace during the 12 months preceding the date of measurement. GSV per active client is calculated by dividing total GSV during the four quarters ended on the date of measurement by the number of active clients on the date of measurement. We believe that the number of active clients and GSV per active client are indicators of the growth and overall health of our business. The number of active clients is a primary driver of GSV and, in turn, marketplace revenue.\n(1)Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased by $31.2 million, or 30%, compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in payment processing fees of $23.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased client spend, as well as increases in cost of talent services to deliver managed services resulting from increases in managed services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, for\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features and prioritizing our advertising and marketing efforts to drive brand awareness and accelerate the acquisition of new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have seen continued acceleration in the growth of GSV per active client as an increasing number of clients continue to mature into higher-value clients and expand their spend on our work marketplace. As a result, our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, sales and marketing expense increased by $50.1 million, or 38%, as compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and brand awareness campaigns of $37.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, as well as increases in personnel-related costs of $11.1 million.\ncash received from stock option exercises of $7.2 million, and proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan of $4.8 million, partially offset by purchases of the Capped Calls of $49.4 million and repayments of borrowings on debt of $10.8 million.\nMarketplace Revenue\nOur Upwork Enterprise offering, which is designed for larger clients with at least 250 employees, includes access to additional product features, premium access to top talent, professional services, custom reporting, and flexible payment terms. For our Upwork Enterprise offering, we charge clients a monthly or annual subscription fee and a service fee calculated as a percentage of the client's spend on talent services, in addition to the service fees paid by talent. Additionally, Upwork Enterprise clients can also subscribe to a compliance offering that includes worker classification services for an additional fee and may also choose to use our work marketplace to engage talent that were not originally sourced through our work marketplace for a lower fee percentage.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nResearch and Development\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.\nGSV includes both client spend and additional fees charged for other services. Client spend, which we define as the total amount that clients spend on both our marketplace offerings and our managed services offering, is the primary component of GSV. GSV also includes fees charged to talent, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, user memberships, and purchases of Connects, and foreign currency exchange.\nEscrow Funding Requirements\nOur Upwork Basic and Plus offerings provide clients with access to talent with verified work history and client feedback on our work marketplace, the ability to instantly match with the right talent, and built-in collaboration features. For talent working with clients that are on our Upwork Basic and Plus offerings, we have a tiered talent service fee schedule based on cumulative lifetime billings by talent to each client. Talent typically pays us 20% of the first $500, 10% for the next $9,500, and then 5% for any amount over $10,000 they bill to each client through our work marketplace. We recognize revenue on Sundays of each week for the majority of our tiered talent service fees as that is the day we have the contractual right to bill talent for the service fees. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from talent through membership fees, purchases of Connects, and withdrawal and other fees.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nFinancial Highlights for 2021\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\nWe utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under current tax law. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we assess, among other things, the historical levels of income and various sources of taxable income. We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, including investing in research and development to build new product features, prioritizing our advertising efforts to reach new and existing clients seeking to engage independent talent, and investing in marketing to accelerate the acquisition of new clients and drive brand awareness. As a result, the number of active clients increased 22% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and our GSV per active client increased 15% as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The growth in active clients and GSV per active client contributed to the growth of GSV and marketplace revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, GSV increased 41%, as compared to the same period in 2020. Marketplace revenue was driven by client spend, which for the year ended December 31, 2021, drove an increase in talent service fees of 36%, as compared to the same period in 2020, and an increase in client payment processing and administrative fees of 42%, as compared to the same period in 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and operations functions; outside consulting, legal, and accounting services; impairment expense; and insurance.\nActive Clients and GSV per Active Client\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions and interest income that we earn from our deposits in money market funds and investments in marketable securities.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operation,\u201d included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nOverview\nGross Profit and Gross Margin. Our gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may be influenced by our revenue, the mix of payment methods that our clients choose, the timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, our continued investments in our services and support teams, the timing and amounts paid to talent in connection with our managed services offering, and the amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and platform development costs. In addition, gross margin will be impacted by fluctuations in our revenue mix between marketplace revenue and managed services revenue. For example, our managed services revenue grew at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, which caused gross margin to increase. We expect gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although gross margin, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCapped Calls\nGeneral and Administrative\nMarketplace take rate measures the correlation between marketplace revenue and marketplace GSV and is calculated by dividing marketplace revenue by marketplace GSV. Marketplace take rate is an important metric because it is the key indicator of how well we monetize spend on our work marketplace from our Upwork Basic, Plus, Enterprise, and other premium offerings. More higher value relationships and higher spend per client results in a larger percentage of business activity on our work marketplace being priced at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our marketplace take rate decreased as clients matured into higher value clients and continue to increase their spend with particular talent, which resulted in a higher mix of talent at the lower rates of our tiered service fee structure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, to drive GSV, we increased the number of free Connects issued to talent, which drove revenue and GSV but also resulted in talent purchasing fewer Connects and memberships during the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in slightly lower revenue as a percentage of GSV during the year ended December 31, 2021. On the other hand, we intend to continue our efforts to better address large enterprise and other clients and prospects with larger, longer-term independent talent needs through our Upwork Enterprise and other premium offerings. These offerings have take rates that are higher than the rest of our business, which partially offsets the trend of lower rates as relationships and clients mature into higher value clients with increased spend. Additionally, we are working on a number of initiatives that could also have a positive impact on marketplace take rate, and we will continue to introduce new or modify existing offerings or other services and features. As a result of these efforts, over the course of 2022, we expect marketplace take rate to increase slightly. However, we also generally expect our marketplace take rate to vary from period to period as marketplace revenue and GSV vary as a result of a variety of factors, such as the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; pricing\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to service providers, including stock options, RSUs, performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and purchase rights granted under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the 2018 ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the estimated fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected dividend yield, the expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rates, and the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards. The fair value and derived service period of stock options with market-based conditions is estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model. We evaluate the assumptions used to value option awards upon each grant of stock options. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined using the closing common stock price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of PSUs that are probable of being earned as of the grant date. We use the quoted market price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the fair value of RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and purchase rights under our 2018 ESPP. We generally recognize the fair value of stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the period during which a service provider is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under the 2018 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period and\nTerm and Revolving Loans\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2021 was $429.0 million, which was primarily a result of investing $525.3 million in various marketable securities, as well as $5.1 million of internal-use software and platform development costs that we paid during the period and purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nAs a licensed internet escrow agent, we offer escrow services to users of our work marketplace and, as such, we are required to hold our users' escrowed cash and in-transit cash in trust as an asset and record a corresponding liability for escrow funds held on behalf of talent and clients on our balance sheet. We expect the balances of our funds held in escrow, including funds held in transit, and the related liability to grow as GSV grows and may vary from period to period. Escrow regulations require us to fund the trust with our operating cash to cover shortages due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings. Talent submit their billings for hourly contracts to their clients on a weekly basis every Sunday, and the aggregate amount of such billings is added to escrow funds payable to talent on the same day. As of each Sunday of each week, we have not yet collected funds for hourly billings from clients as these funds are in transit. Therefore, in order to satisfy escrow funding requirements, every Sunday we fund the shortage of cash in trust with our own operating cash and typically collect this cash shortage from clients within the next several days. As a result, we expect our total cash and cash flows from operating activities to be impacted when a quarter ends on a Sunday. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, funds held in escrow, including funds in transit, were $160.8 million and $135.0 million, respectively.\n\nConvertible Senior Notes Due 2026\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash from operating activities is revenue generated from our work marketplace. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, marketing activities, including advertising, payment processing fees, amounts paid to talent to deliver services for clients under our managed services offering, and third-party hosting costs. In addition, because we are licensed as an internet escrow agent, our total cash and cash provided by operating activities may be impacted by the timing of the end of our fiscal quarter as discussed in the section titled -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Escrow Funding Requirements.\u201d\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTo achieve our strategic objectives, we expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and to incur additional general and administrative expenses, including increased stock-based compensation expense related to executive compensation arrangements, legal and accounting costs, insurance premiums, and compliance costs. Additionally, in 2020 we shifted to a flexible work model for our workforce and are evaluating our current need for office space. As a result, we may determine to either close or sublease certain of our offices, either of which could result in further impairment charges being recognized in general and administrative expense. As a result, we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, although this expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, may vary from period to period.\nWe generate revenue from both talent and clients, with a majority of our revenue generated from service fees charged to talent. We also generate revenue from fees charged to both clients and talent for other services, such as for transacting payments through our work marketplace, premium offerings, purchases of Connects, foreign currency exchange when clients choose to pay in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our Upwork Payroll offering. In addition, we provide a managed services offering where we engage talent to complete projects, directly invoice the client, and assume responsibility for work performed.\nMarketplace revenue is the primary driver of our business, and we believe it provides comparability to other online marketplaces. The growth rate of marketplace revenue fluctuates in relation to the growth rate of GSV. Therefore, marketplace revenue is correlated to GSV, and we believe that our marketplace revenue will grow as GSV grows, although they could grow at different rates. In 2021, we prioritized our advertising, marketing, and product development efforts to reach those new and existing clients seeking to engage remote talent in light of the acceleration in the shift toward remote work, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we experienced increases in user acquisition and growth in the number of active clients, which drove an increase in talent billings, and, in turn, drove an increase in marketplace revenue. We expect our marketplace revenue growth rates to continue to vary from period to period due to a variety of other factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic impact on the businesses and spending behavior of our current and prospective clients; the number of Sundays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for the majority of our talent service fees each week) or the number of Mondays (i.e., the day we have the contractual right to bill and recognize revenue for a substantial portion of our client fees each week) in any given quarter; the lapping of significant launches of new products, pricing changes, and other monetization efforts; the number of active clients and their spend on our work marketplace; and the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, Upwork Enterprise clients, and the timing of those results.\nRevenue \nincome tax return, and also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluation of uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. A liability is reported for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding borrowings.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nWe continue to see businesses of all sizes use our work marketplace in a recurring way for larger, more complex projects, and we expect the number of active clients and GSV per active client to continue to increase over time but could vary quarter by quarter depending, in part, on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting macroeconomic downturn impacts our business, the businesses of our clients, and other factors identified in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nFinancing Activities\nThe initial cap price of the Capped Calls is $92.74 per share of common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes and the Capped Calls.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was $29.4 million, which resulted primarily from cash received from stock option exercises of $18.2 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase program of $6.4 million, and an increase in escrow funds payable of $10.5 million, partially offset by net repayments of debt of $5.7 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was $537.7 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds from the Notes, net of debt issuance costs of $560.1 million, an increase in escrow funds payable of $25.8 million,\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, third-party hosting costs increased $2.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by our use of two AWS data centers during the period in connection with our migration from the AWS facility in California to the AWS facility in Oregon.\nInvesting Activities\nWe also believe that our principal sources of liquidity will allow us to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from users, as further described above in Risk Factors-Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are expected to continue to evolve. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the pandemic.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax (benefit) provision; and, if applicable, other non-cash transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with, and is not an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, we are unable to fully assess the aggregate impact it will have on our business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its effect on the economy, its impact to the businesses of our clients, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities related to the pandemic, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled Our business experienced, and may again experience, an adverse impact from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as new variants of COVID-19 emerge. In addition, the positive impacts on our business resulting from the shift to remote work during the pandemic may not continue as the pandemic subsides and the restrictions intended to prevent its spread are relaxed or lifted.\u201d\nOne of our premium offerings, Upwork Payroll, is available to clients when talent are classified as employees for engagements on our work marketplace. The client enters into an Upwork Payroll agreement with us, and we separately contract with unrelated third-party staffing providers that provide employment services to such clients.\nSales and Marketing\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears, and are due August 15, 2026. Upon conversion, we have an option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $560.1 million, after deducting debt issuance costs. We used approximately $49.4 million of the net proceeds from the Notes offering to pay the cost of the Capped Calls. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including marketing, brand awareness and sales, and which may include working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that we may identify in the future. See Note 7-Debt\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Notes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nchanges; the ability of the recent and continued investment in our enterprise sales team to accelerate the acquisition of, and achieve increased spend from, our Upwork Enterprise clients and the timing of those results; and ongoing efforts to improve processes on our work marketplace, including project proposals and purchases of Connects, among others.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions intended to prevent its spread have continued to accelerate the secular shift toward remote and independent work, and, with our unique, remote-based business model, the pandemic has not impacted our clients' access to highly-skilled talent to complete short- and long-term projects on our work marketplace.
