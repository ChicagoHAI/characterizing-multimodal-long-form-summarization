Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking\u201d statements that are intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial and business performance. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as may,\u201d expects,\u201d should,\u201d believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d intends\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, statements that refer to our future financial performance, anticipated growth and trends in our business and in our industry and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nConsequently, such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as our current plans, estimates and beliefs with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. You should review Forward Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nOverview\nWe provide life insurance protection targeted to the middle American market. We believe there is a substantial unmet need for life insurance, particularly among domestic households with annual incomes of between $50,000 and $125,000, a market we refer to as our target Middle Market. We differentiate our product and service offerings through innovative product design and sales processes, with an emphasis on rapidly issued products that are not medically underwritten at the time of sale.\nWe conduct our business through our two operating subsidiaries, Fidelity Life, an Illinois-domiciled life insurance company, and Efinancial, a call center-based insurance agency. Efinancial sells Fidelity Life products through its own call center distribution platform, independent agents and other marketing organizations. Efinancial, in addition to offering Fidelity Life products, sells insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. We report our operating results in three segments: Agency, Insurance and Corporate.\nCOVID-19\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The measures governments worldwide have enacted to combat the pandemic have resulted in disruptions in global and local supply chains and have led to adverse impacts on economic and market conditions as well as increases in unemployment. The severity of COVID-19 and duration of government containment actions have impacted both employees and customers of the Company and presented material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company's performance, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe stress and disruption placed on the global economy and financial markets from the outbreak of COVID-19 may continue to have near and long-term negative effects on investment valuations, returns, and credit allowance exposure. The Company will continue to closely monitor the situation, including potential negative impacts on sales of new policies and mortality; however, due to the highly uncertain nature of these conditions, it is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of COVID-19 or its impact to the Company's operations, but the effect could be material.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an estimated $4.3 million in net incurred policyholder claims that included COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death.\nThe Company continues to monitor the effects of the changing economic environment on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and currently have a number of securities on our watch list, which are mainly concentrated in the oil and gas and airline sectors. Our assessment through December 31, 2020 has resulted in no additional material other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI) due to COVID-19 and the recent market events.\nIn response to the economic impact related to COVID-19, concessions were granted to certain of the Company's mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications. At June 30, 2020, the Company held 25 mortgage loans where requests for temporary modifications were granted (23 were modified to interest only and 2 to forbearance). The total loan balance for these 25 loans amounted to $4.4 million or about 9% of the mortgage loan portfolio. At June 30, 2020, 17 of the 25 temporary loan modifications had returned to full payment (both principal and interest) under the modified loan terms, including the 2 loans given forbearance. Of the remaining 8 loans that were granted loan modifications, 7 of these loans returned to full payment status as of September 30. 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company granted a loan modification through December 31, 2020 on a loan that was outside of the original 25 loan modifications previously granted. The combined loan balance of the 2 loans under temporary modification status at December 31, 2020 amounted to $0.5 million, or less than 1% of the mortgage loan portfolio.\nNational Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC\nIn the second quarter 2020, Fidelity Life entered into a General Agent's agreement with an unaffiliated third party, National Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC ( AmeriLife\u201d). This agreement provides Fidelity Life access to AmeriLife distribution channels, its commission systems and assists in streamlining administrative processes related to commissions. This agreement also allows Efinancial to operate as a sub agent to AmeriLife. On May 15, 2020, the Company began selling products using this new distribution arrangement.\nAgency Segment\nThis segment primarily consists of the operations of Efinancial. Efinancial is a call center-based insurance agency that markets life insurance for Fidelity Life and unaffiliated insurance companies. Efinancial's primary operations are conducted through employee agents from three call center locations, which we refer to as our retail channel. In addition, Efinancial operates as a wholesale agency, assisting independent agents that desire to work for the carriers that Efinancial represents, which we refer to as our wholesale channel.\nEfinancial also generates insurance lead sales revenue through its eCoverage web presence. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our Agency Segment revenue earned 85% and 78% through the retail channel, 5% and 8% through the wholesale channel, and 10% and 14% through insurance lead sales revenue, respectively.\nThe Agency Segment's main source of revenue is commissions earned on the sale of insurance policies sold through our retail channel. Efinancial's employee agents utilize insurance sales leads to contact or be contacted by potential customers and then work with the customers to complete the sales process, which can occur during the initial contact or within 24 to 48 hours for non-medically underwritten policies. In our wholesale channel, we subcontract with our independent agents who sell through Efinancial's contracts with its unaffiliated insurance carriers. In consideration for using our carrier contracts and services, we receive a portion of the commission earned by the independent agent from the carrier.\nAgency Segment expenses consist of marketing costs to acquire potential customers, salary and bonuses paid to our employee agents, salary and other costs of employees involved in managing the underwriting process for our insurance applications, sales management, agent licensing, training and compliance costs. Other Agency Segment expenses include costs associated with financial and administrative employees, facilities rent, and information technology. After payroll, the most significant Agency Segment expense is the cost of acquiring leads. We are able to partially offset our sales leads expense through advertising revenues from individuals who click on specific advertisements while viewing one of our web pages, and through the resale of leads that are not well suited for our call center. For years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, these offsetting revenues were $5.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, which reduced our total agency expenses by approximately 10% and 11%, respectively. Our Agency Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that commissions and other revenue exceed (are less than) our marketing and overhead costs for the period.\nInsurance Segment\nThis segment consists of the operations of Fidelity Life. Fidelity Life underwrites primarily term life insurance through Efinancial and a diverse group of independent insurance distributors. Fidelity Life specializes in life insurance products that can be issued immediately or within a short period following a sales call, using non-medical underwriting at the time of policy issuance.\nFidelity Life engages in the following business lines:\nCore Life - Our Core Life insurance business is the primary business of the Insurance Segment. Core Life represents a significant portion of the insurance business written by Fidelity Life since it resumed independent operations in 2005. Our Core Life business consists of in\u00adforce policies that are considered to be of high strategic importance to Fidelity Life.\nNon\u00adCore Life - Our Non\u00adCore Life business consists of: products that are currently being marketed but are not deemed to be of high strategic importance to the Company\u037e in\u00adforce policies from product lines introduced since Fidelity Life resumed independent operations in 2005, but were subsequently discontinued\u037e and an older annuity block of business that was not included in the Closed Block.\nClosed Block - Our Closed Block represents all in\u00adforce participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. The Closed Block was established in connection with our 2007 reorganization into a mutual holding company structure and represents all in-force participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. Annuities and assumed life represent (i) our assumed life business, which consists of policies primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s; (ii) our direct annuity contracts, which consist of approximately 77 structured settlement contracts that remain from a group of contracts entered into in the late 1980s; and (iii) our assumed annuities, which consist of contract-holder deposits assumed from a former affiliate under two coinsurance treaties entered into in 1991 and 1992. The 2019 demutualization of Members Mutual Holding Company had no impact on how the Closed Block is structured.\nWe have not accepted new policies in these legacy lines since 2006 or prior, and these lines are considered to be in run-off\u201d with a declining number of policies in force each period. We recognize income on the Closed Block, and annuities and assumed life to the extent that premium revenues and net investment income exceed the benefit expenses and operating expenses (including paid and accrued policyholder dividends) of these lines of business. On the two annuity lines, we recognize income (loss) to the extent that our net investment income earned exceeds (are less than) benefit expenses (direct annuities) and amounts credited on policy deposits (assumed annuities) and operating expenses of the two lines.\nAnnuities and Assumed Life - We have assumed reinsurance commitments with respect to annuity contract-holder deposits and a block of life insurance contracts that were ceded by former affiliates of Fidelity Life. On March 29, 2019, one of these former affiliates recaptured the majority of the assumed block of life business. The annuity deposits were ceded to Fidelity Life through two contracts entered into in the early 1990s. These annuity and assumed life deposits are now largely in run\u00adoff, with only minor amounts of new deposits each year. There are minimal remaining surrender charges associated with the assumed annuity contracts.\nOur Insurance Segment revenues consist of net insurance premiums, net investment income, and net realized gains (losses) on investments. Our distributors consist of Efinancial and the independent insurance agencies that we contract with to sell our insurance products to the customers (policyholders) who buy our insurance policies. We recognize premium revenue from our policyholders. We purchase reinsurance coverage to help manage the risk on our insurance policies by paying, or ceding, a portion of the policyholder premiums to the reinsurance companies. Our net insurance premiums reflect amounts collected from policyholders, plus premiums assumed under reinsurance agreements less premiums ceded to reinsurance companies. Net investment income represents primarily interest income earned on fixed maturity securities that we purchase with cash flows from our premium revenues. We also realize gains and losses on sales of investment securities. These investments support our liability for policy reserves and provide the capital required to operate our insurance business. Capital requirements are primarily established by regulatory authorities. See Note 2-Investments\u201d and Business-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\nInsurance Segment expenses consist of benefits paid to policyholders or their beneficiaries under life insurance policies. Benefit expenses also include additions to the reserve for future policyholder benefits to recognize our estimated future obligations under the policies. Benefit expenses are shown net of amounts ceded under our reinsurance contracts. Our Insurance Segment also incurs policy acquisition costs that consist of commissions paid to agents, policy underwriting and issue costs and variable sales costs. A portion of these policy acquisition costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the insurance policies acquired during the period. In addition to policy acquisition costs, we incur expenses that vary based on the number of contracts that we have in-force, or variable policy administrative costs. These variable costs consist of expenses paid to third-party administrators based on rates for each policy administered. As the number of in-force policies increases, these expenses will increase. Conversely, when the number of in-force policies declines, variable policy expenses decline. Our insurance operations also incur overhead costs for functional and administrative staff to support insurance operations, financial reporting and information technology. We recognize income (loss) on insurance operations to the extent that premium revenues, net investment income and realized gains (losses) exceed (are less than) benefit expenses and general operating expenses for the period.\nCorporate Segment\nThe results of this segment consist of net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) earned on invested assets. We also include certain corporate expenses that are not allocated to our other segments, including expenses of Vericity, Inc., board expenses, allocation of executive management time spent on corporate matters, and financial reporting and auditing costs related to our consolidation and internal controls. Our Corporate Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) exceed (are less than) corporate expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Results\nStrategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\nUsing Efinancial, our controlled distribution platform, we have full vertical integration for the sale and issuance of life insurance policies and are able to gather end-to-end consumer data, extending from tracking data to analyzing the characteristics of leads that generate successful marketing efforts to the associated underwriting and claims experience. Since we acquired Efinancial in 2009, we have made significant investments in the development of our controlled distribution strategy for reaching our target market. By converting data we generate through our distribution platform into actionable insight using statistical analysis, we will seek to be more efficient in our acquisition and use of leads, improve our call center placement ratios and strive to achieve overall profitability. However, the investments made in pursuit of this strategy, among other factors, have adversely affected our historical results of operations.\nEfinancial agents produced 88.6% and 86.8% of the direct policies written by Fidelity Life for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We plan to increase the number of policies sold through Efinancial as we pursue our strategic plan to further develop our controlled distribution platform and grow our book of business. However, sales of insurance policies through Efinancial immediately result in significantly higher consolidated expense recognition and lower consolidated net income in comparison to Fidelity Life policies distributed through an unaffiliated entity. GAAP requires that we immediately expense that portion of our policy acquisition costs for policies placed through Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the placement of a policy. As a result of this immediate expense recognition of the majority of policy acquisition costs of our sales through Efinancial, we incur a net loss in the first year on each policy sold through Efinancial. To the extent we are successful in increasing our premium writings through Efinancial over each of the next several years or more, we expect that the impact of recognizing a majority of Efinancial commissions as a current expense will, among other factors, continue to adversely affect our results of operations and contribute to our continuing to incur consolidated net losses and a reduction to our consolidated equity in each such year as we seek to implement our distribution strategy. Over the long term and assuming that our products perform consistent with our assumptions, once we have developed a sustainable book of business and our expected growth through Efinancial has leveled, we expect that revenues from policy renewals may begin to offset the immediate expense recognition resulting from writing new policies through Efinancial. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\u201d and Results of Operations-Analysis of Segment Results-Corporate Segment-Intercompany Eliminations.\u201d\nAccuracy of Our Pricing Assumptions\nIn order for our insurance operations to be profitable, we must achieve product experience consistent with our pricing assumptions. We price our products using a number of assumptions that are designed to support the desired level of profitability. Our operating results will be affected by variances between our pricing assumptions and our actual experience. The key pricing assumptions made are:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Investment Returns. We earn income on the investments held to support reserves and capital requirements. The amount of net investment income that we recognize will vary depending on the amount of invested assets that we own, the types of investments we own, the interest rates earned and amount of dividends received on our investments. If the actual amount of net investment income earned is less than projected, our products may not generate the desired level of profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Persistency Experience. Many of the non-medically underwritten products that we issue have a limited amount of insurance industry information to use in developing policy lapse rates. We are developing our own historical experience as to expected lapse rates for these products and reflect our emerging experience in our pricing. If actual policy lapse rates exceed the lapse rates assumed in pricing our products, we may receive lower premium revenues and may not receive enough premium to cover all of our acquisition costs for the policy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Mortality Experience. We use our historical experience combined with experience projections from our reinsurance partners to develop our assumptions for the level, frequency and pattern of future claims experience. In our Insurance Segment, we principally issue non-medically underwritten products through underwriting processes that generally have limited recent company and industry experience; therefore, their performance may be less reliable and subject to greater variance than products underwritten through processes with more established industry experience.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating Expenses. Our level of operating expenses affects our reported net income (loss). Our general operating expenses include expenses that vary based on the growth in our revenues and expenses that are fixed regardless of revenue growth. As discussed above, we have experienced operating losses principally because our operating expenses and corporate overhead exceed our revenues, and our inability to defer a majority of our commission expense on policies produced by our affiliated agency, Efinancial.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEfinancial Commission Financing\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fidelity Life changed the commission structure related to Efinancial's sale of the RAPIDecision\u00ae Life to pay annual level commissions over the life of the product instead of heaped, or first-year-only commissions. This change reduced Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business by spreading its statutory commission expenses over the life of the policy instead of incurring it all in the policy year of issue. In order to help provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions, Fidelity Life and Efinancial entered into a financing arrangement with Hannover Life under which, on a monthly basis, Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to the first-year-only commissions on Fidelity Life RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business sold through Efinancial. In exchange, Efinancial assigns to Hannover Life its right to all future levelized commission payments on that business due from Fidelity Life, and Fidelity Life pays to Hannover Life the level commissions over the life of the contract. Our arrangement with Hannover Life allows us to finance up to $30.0 million of commission expense. Efinancial's ability to receive advances under this arrangement will terminate when the aggregate amount advanced under the arrangement equals or exceeds $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nRecapture of Assumed Life Business\nUnder an agreement with Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective Life), the successor to a former affiliate of Fidelity Life, Fidelity Life had assumed a portion of risk on a group of life insurance contracts primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s. On March 29, 2019, Protective Life and Fidelity Life agreed that Protective Life would recapture the majority of this assumed life block of business, thereby relieving Fidelity Life from further liability under the recaptured business (except for obligations incurred prior to the recapture effective date). Under the recapture agreement, Fidelity Life paid Protective Life an amount equal to the assumed carried reserves, and in turn, Fidelity Life will receive payment from its reinsurers of this business for their portion of the related ceded reserves. We recognized a $2.2 million gain from this transaction in 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies are described in Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and\nassumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience, market indicators and other relevant factors and circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may affect our financial position and results of operations.\nValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities\nOur fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale\u201d securities, which are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. For investments that are not actively traded, the determination of fair value requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Fair value determinations include consideration of both observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. Security pricing is applied using a hierarchy approach.\nLevel 1-Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets the Company can access.\nLevel 2-This level includes fixed maturity securities priced principally by independent pricing services using observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; and model-derived valuations for which all significant inputs are observable market data. Level 2 instruments include most corporate debt securities and U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities that are valued by models using inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3-Fair values are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. Level 3 instruments include less liquid securities for which significant inputs are unobservable in the market, such as structured securities with complex features that require significant management assumptions or estimation in the fair value measurement. Level 3 hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and equity securities by fair value hierarchy was as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> Fair Value of Investments as of December 31, 2020\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 367,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> Fair Value of Investments as of December 31, 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 311,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLevel 1 securities include principally exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices for identical assets.\nAll of the fair values of our fixed maturity and equity securities within Level 2 are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services. All of our prices for each security are generally sourced from multiple pricing vendors, and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type and region of the world, based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. We ultimately use the price from the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type and region. For fixed maturity securities that do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications which incorporate a variety of inputs including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and U.S. Treasury curves. Specifically, for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Securities with validated quotes from pricing services are reflected within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as they generally are based on observable pricing for similar assets or other market significant observable inputs.\nLevel 3 fair value classification consists of investments in structured securities where the fair value of the security is determined by a pricing service using internal pricing models where one or more of the significant inputs is unobservable in the marketplace, or there is a single broker/dealer quote. The fair value of a broker-quoted asset is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. The Company does not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset.\nIf we believe the pricing information received from third-party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs observable in the market, we may challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service. Historically, we have not challenged or updated the prices provided by third-party pricing services. However, any such updates by a pricing service to be more consistent with the presented market observations, or any adjustments made by us to prices provided by third-party pricing services, would be reflected in the balance sheet for the current period.\nWhen the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3).\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\nSecurities that are classified as available-for-sale are subject to market declines below amortized cost (a gross unrealized loss position). When a gross unrealized loss position occurs, the security is considered impaired. Quarterly or when necessary, we review each impaired security to identify whether the impairment may be other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) and require the recognition of an impairment loss in the current period earnings. Indication of OTTI includes potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or other company or industry specific concerns. A number of factors are considered in determining whether or not a decline in a specific security is other-than-temporary, including our current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. An impairment loss will be recorded if our intention is to sell an impaired security or it is considered to be more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security.\nOur review of our available-for-sale securities for impairment includes an analysis of impaired securities in terms of severity and/or age of the gross unrealized loss. Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the issuer of the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the likelihood for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential that includes the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, collateral position, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether expected cash flows will be sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nThe credit loss component of fixed maturity securities impairment is calculated as the difference between amortized cost of the security and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of cash flows discounted at the effective rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or prior impairment. The methodology and assumptions for estimating the cash flows vary depending on the type of security. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates, including prepayment assumptions, are based on data from widely accepted third-party sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss exists, and the security is considered to be temporarily impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, the security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The portion of the OTTI that is not considered a credit loss, is recognized as OTTI in accumulated comprehensive income.\nThere was OTTI on fixed maturity securities in the amount of $68 thousand and $41 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loans are held on commercial real estate and are stated at the aggregate unpaid principal balances, net of any write-downs and valuation allowances. We identify loans for evaluation of impairment primarily based on the collection experience of each loan. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect principal or interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral. Impairments are included in net realized investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest income from mortgage loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method. Accrual of income is generally suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Mortgage loans are considered past due when full principal or interest payments have not been received according to contractual terms.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was a valuation allowance of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nFor our Insurance Segment, the costs of acquiring new business are deferred to the extent that they are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions paid in the first policy year that are in excess of the ultimate renewal commissions payable on the policy. For any of our policies for which we do not pay renewal commissions, the deferred acquisition costs (at the segment level) include all commissions paid in the first year. For policies for which we pay levelized commissions over the life of the policy, we expense the first-year commission and therefore do not defer any other commission expense. We also defer costs associated with policy underwriting and issuance related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Non-deferred first year acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred include expenses that do not meet the definition of a deferrable cost, which includes the acquisition costs incurred on insurance applications that do not result in an in-force policy (unsuccessful efforts).\nThe amortization of DAC for traditional life insurance products is determined as a level proportion of premium based on actuarial methods and assumptions about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments, established by us at the time the policy is issued. GAAP requires that assumptions for these types of products not be modified while the policy is outstanding. Amortization is adjusted each period to reflect policy lapse or termination rates compared to anticipated experience. Accordingly, acceleration of DAC amortization could occur if policies terminate earlier than originally assumed. We establish the assumptions used to determine DAC amortization based on estimates using Company experience and other relevant information that is used to price the products. We monitor our actual experience and will update the actuarial factors applied to future policy issues if warranted. The selection of actuarial assumptions requires considerable judgment and has inherent uncertainty. Should actual policy lapse experience be higher than that assumed during a reporting period, we will amortize our DAC balance faster and report lower net income.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our DAC asset as part of our premium deficiency testing. If a premium deficiency exists, we reduce DAC by the amount of the deficiency through a charge to current period earnings (loss). If the deficiency is more than the recognized DAC balance, we reduce the DAC balance to zero and increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess with a corresponding charge to current period earnings (loss). See Future Policy Benefit Reserves\u201d below for more information on premium deficiency testing.\nOur consolidated DAC will be lower relative to other insurance companies that utilize unaffiliated distributors. GAAP does not permit the deferral of commission revenues paid to Efinancial, our affiliated agency, in excess of those expenses actually incurred by Efinancial in the placement of the policy. Because we are focused on increasing insurance premium volume through Efinancial, our operating results will reflect higher current period expenses and lower current reported net income. Therefore, in consolidation, the first-year commission acquisition costs ( Commission DAC\u201d) recorded in our Insurance Segment is reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from expenses of Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral. As a result of recognizing a majority of expenses for the Efinancial sales immediately, we will recognize a charge against our consolidated earnings (loss) and consolidated equity in the amount of such expenses for the period in which they are incurred. See Results of Operations-Analysis of Segment Results-Corporate Segment-Intercompany Eliminations.\u201d\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future claims payments to policyholders using actuarial assumptions in accordance with industry practice and GAAP. Many factors affect these reserves, including mortality trends, policy persistency and investment returns. We establish our reserves based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience.\nThe calculation of future policy reserves requires the use of significant judgment and is inherently uncertain. If our actual experience differs from the experience assumed in establishing our reserves, the impact of these differences is reflected in the results of operations in each period. If actual claims are higher than assumed claims experience, our reported income (loss) will be reduced (increased) for the periods in which this experience occurs. If actual policy lapses are higher than that assumed, our future policy benefit reserves will be reduced for the period in which this experience occurs.\nThe primary reserve method that is used in calculation of our future policy benefit reserves is the net level premium method. The net level premium method requires that the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use a number of actuarial assumptions that represent management's best estimate at the time the contract was issued with the addition of a margin for adverse deviation. Actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, mortality, policy persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts.\nA premium deficiency exists if the discounted present value of future gross premiums is not sufficient to cover anticipated future cash outflows. To assess the adequacy of our benefit reserves, we annually perform premium deficiency testing for each of our\nlines of business using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without provision for adverse deviation. If benefit reserves minus the DAC asset are less than the present value of future cash flows on the line of business, then first the DAC asset will be reduced. If reducing the DAC asset down to zero is still not sufficient to eliminate the premium deficiency, then benefit reserves will be increased. Recognizing a premium deficiency will reduce our reported net income or increase our reported loss, for the period.\nUnder best estimate assumptions as to mortality, lapses, expenses, and investment yields, DAC is still recoverable on the Core Life and Non-Core Life products (Open Block), Closed Block, and assumed life line of business. The annuities line has no remaining DAC, and under best estimate assumptions on that line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nIn connection with our premium deficiency testing, we performed sensitivity analyses on our Open Block, Closed Block, annuities, and assumed life business lines to capture the effect that certain key assumptions have on expected future cash flows, and the impact of those assumptions on the adequacy of DAC balances and GAAP benefit reserves. The sensitivity tests are performed independently, without consideration for any correlation among the key assumptions.\nWe performed the following sensitivity tests as of September 30, 2020:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future lapse assumptions increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.05,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future mortality increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.05 for all life blocks,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future investment yield assumptions were lowered by 50 basis points.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegarding this sensitivity testing for the annuities line, there is no remaining DAC due to the age of the contracts. As such, these sensitivity runs tested the adequacy of the benefit reserves for this line. For the annuities line, a drop in investment yield of 50 basis points would result in a required reserve increase of $0.7 million, while for the mortality scenario and the lapse scenario there would be no impact to benefit reserves.\nFor the assumed life line of business sensitivity testing, there is also no remaining DAC. Under all the sensitivity tests on this line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nFor the Open Block sensitivity testing, DAC is still recoverable under the lapse sensitivity test. However, under the mortality and investment earned rates sensitivity tests, the DAC would have to be decreased by $5.9 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder applicable Federal income tax guidance, the taxation of life insurance companies is subject to special rules not applicable to other (non-life) companies. Accordingly, we have to consider the implications of these different tax rules in accounting for income tax expense, as separately applicable to our life and non-life subgroups of companies.\nWe record federal income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on pre-tax income as determined using GAAP accounting. The timing of the recognition of certain income and expense items for GAAP accounting can differ from the timing of recognition of the same income and expense items in our federal tax returns. The timing of recognition in the federal tax return is based on tax laws and regulations. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is different than that reported in the tax returns.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred taxes for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. Under GAAP, we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. To the extent that we are required to establish an additional valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, the amount of such valuation allowance would generally be charged against our net income for the period in which that valuation allowance is established.\nWe establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to realize the value of the deferred tax asset. We evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis. Negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years. Positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income and tax-planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in\nwhich temporary differences are deductible or creditable. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recognized deferred tax asset value may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a 100% valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets related to the non-life subgroup of our tax return because we determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recoverable. The recording of the valuation allowance increases our federal income tax expense which in turn reduces our reported net income or increases our net loss as applicable. Our recorded net deferred tax asset is shown in the following table. The balances for each period are shown based on the life/non-life portions of the consolidated federal tax returns and in total.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-Life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income tax assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deferred tax assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deferred tax liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred tax asset (liability) before\nvaluation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,665\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,665\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income tax assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the valuation allowance on the non-life subgroup, the effective income tax rate reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Operations will vary depending on the portion of our pretax income (loss) that results from our life subgroup and the portion from our non-life subgroup. With the current full valuation allowance, the current tax benefit related to our non-life subgroup is limited. We continue to record tax expense (benefit) related to the pretax income (loss) of our life subgroup.\nPrincipal Revenue & Expense Items\nRevenues\nOur primary revenue sources are life insurance premiums, commissions, net investment income, net realized investment gains (losses), insurance lead sales and other income.\nNet Premiums\nNet premiums consist of direct life insurance premiums due and collected from our policyholders on in-force insurance policies and premiums collected on assumed life reinsurance contracts, less reinsurance premiums paid to reinsurers. Direct premiums are recorded in our Insurance Segment and classified as first year premiums when they relate to the first calendar year coverage period. Premiums for policies outside their first calendar year are called renewal premiums.\nEarned Commission\nEarned commission revenue consists of amounts received and due from insurance carriers on policies sold by Efinancial and is recorded in our Agency Segment. However, the commission revenue from sales of Fidelity Life policies is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations because Efinancial and Fidelity Life are affiliated.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income consists of income generated from our investment portfolio and is recorded net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income primarily consists of interest income earned on fixed maturity security investments and dividends earned on our equity holdings, net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income earned on assets required to support insurance reserves, annuity deposits and related regulatory capital requirements is allocated to our Insurance Segment. Any other net investment income is recorded in the Corporate Segment.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nNet realized investment gains (losses) result from sales of investment securities and OTTI for estimated credit losses of fixed maturity securities.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nIn our Agency Segment, insurance lead sales revenue consists of (i) click-through revenues we generate when leads click through to our webpages to access information about life insurance options sponsored by another company and (ii) data revenues we generate through the sale of information regarding leads.\nOther Income\nFor our Insurance Segment, other income primarily consists of cost of insurance charges on universal life contracts.\nBenefits and Expenses\nThis category consists of benefits to policyholders, which include policyholder dividends and policyholder dividend obligations (PDO), interest credited to policyholder and contract-holder balances, general operating expenses and amortization of DAC.\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\nBenefit expenses are recorded in our Insurance Segment. Benefit expenses include claims paid or payable on in-force insurance policies, as well as the change in our reserves for future policy benefits during the period. Benefit expenses are reduced by amounts ceded to reinsurance companies with whom we contract to share policy risks.\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nThe interest credited primarily relates to amounts that contract-holders earn on any contract-holder deposits from our assumed annuity contracts and other amounts left on deposit with us. Our universal life policies and assumed annuity contracts require Fidelity Life to periodically establish the crediting rate to be paid on policyholder and contract-holder deposits. All current assumed annuity contracts are credited with interest at the minimum interest rate guaranteed in the contract. Interest credited relates solely to our Insurance Segment.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating expenses are incurred by all of our segments. The operating expenses of our Insurance Segment include policy acquisition costs in excess of amounts that qualify for deferral, ceding commissions received on ceded reinsurance in excess of amounts deferred, variable policy administration costs, general overhead and administration costs, and insurance premium taxes and assessments paid to various states. Agency Segment expenses consist of compensation paid to employee sales agents, costs of insurance sales leads (marketing), costs of sales management and support activities, agent licensing expenses and general overhead and administration expenses. The expenses of the Corporate Segment include allocation of a portion of the compensation of senior executives related to corporate activities, Board of Director expenses related to corporate business, and other operating costs considered to be of a corporate nature and not directly related to either of our other business segments. Overhead and administrative expenses of the segments include employee costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits), office rent, information technology and costs of third-party administrators and other contractors.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDAC amortization represents the actuarially determined reduction in the DAC asset for the period. The amount of acquisition cost amortization recognized each period is based on actual factors established when the insurance contracts were written.\nResults of Operations\nThe major components of operating revenues, benefits and expenses and net (loss) income are as follows:\nVericity, Inc.

This increase of $12.5 million primarily resulted from higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions, partially offset by decreases in net investment income, realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales.\nBenefits and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total benefits and expenses were $175.1 million compared to $155.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $19.6 million was primarily due to higher life, annuity, and health claim benefits.\nLoss from Operations Before Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a loss before taxes of $27.3 million compared to a loss before taxes of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increased loss of $7.1 million was primarily due to increases in life, annuity, and health claim benefits and decreases in net investment income, net realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales, partially offset by higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our income tax benefit was $2.3 million compared to an income tax benefit of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased benefit of $1.4 million reflects increased net loss attributable to the life sub-group. The non-life sub-group, which has a full valuation allowance, therefore no tax impact.

This increase of $4.0 million resulted from increased sales in the retail channel, which was primarily driven by increased agent headcount, partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale channel.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, insurance lead sales were $5.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.3 million was primarily due to lower click and transfer revenue.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, general operating expenses were $49.2 million compared to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $3.5 million was primarily due to lower marketing costs and the 2019 expense of $0.9 million from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO.\nNet (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Agency Segment incurred a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net loss of $6.2 million was primarily the result of higher earned commissions and a reduction of operating costs and expenses, partially offset by lower insurance lead sales revenue.\nInsurance Segment\nThe results of our Insurance Segment were as follows:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net insurance premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other-than-temporary impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefits and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Life, annuity, and health claim benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total benefits and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from operations before income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,347\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,155\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Insurance Premiums\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net insurance premiums were $108.0 million compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $13.6 million was primarily due to growth in our Core Life lines of $5.9 million, mainly driven by increases in LifeTime Benefit Term (LBT) and RAPIDecision\u00ae Life and a $7.1 million increase in Closed Block and annuities of $0.5 million.\nNet Investment Income\nSee Note 2-Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nSee Note 2-Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, life, annuity and health claim benefits were $77.7 million compared with $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $15.8 million was mainly attributable to an increase of $4.8 million in net claim benefits resulting from $6.8 million higher claim activity on certain Core and Non-Core products, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in annuities and assumed life. Change in benefit reserves increased $11.1 million, primarily related to $1.4 million in our Core and Non-Core lines, $5.9 million in Closed Block and $4.4 million in assumed life resulting from the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in annuities.\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest credited was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $0.1 million was due to lower interest credited on assumed fixed annuity contract-holder account balances.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, general operating expenses were $31.6 million compared to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to a reduction in reinsurance allowances of $3.3 million, which includes $6.8 million related to the Closed Block, partially offset by increased allowances of $3.6 million in the Core Life and\nNon-Core Life lines. In addition, there was $1.0 million increase in depreciation costs and $1.1 million in staff costs. The increases were partially offset by $1.8 million costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019. See Closed Block\u201d section in this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding Closed Block and Note 8- Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $16.7 million compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.6 million includes a $2.2 million decrease in Closed Block, primarily due to lapses partially offset by an increase in our Core and Non-Core lines of $0.6 million.\nNet (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss was $8.3 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net loss of $7.1 million resulted primarily from higher life, annuity and health claim benefits, lower net investment income, lower net realized gains and increases in net operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in net insurance premiums and lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nClosed Block\nThe Closed Block was formed as of October 1, 2006 and contains all participating policies issued or assumed by Fidelity Life. The assets and future net cash flows of the Closed Block are available only for purposes of paying benefits, expenses and dividends of the Closed Block and are not available to the Company, except for an amount of additional funding that was established at inception. The additional funding was designed to protect the block against future adverse experience, and if the funding is not required for that purpose, it is subject to reversion to the Company in the future. Any reversion of Closed Block assets to the Company must be approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance.\nIncluded in Closed Block assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are $10.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of additional Closed Block funding, plus accrued interest, that is eligible for reversion to the Company if not needed to fund Closed Block experience.\nThe Closed Block was funded based on a model developed to forecast the future cash flows of the Closed Block which is referred to as the glide path.\u201d The glide path model projected the anticipated future cash flows of the Closed Block as established at the initial funding. We compare the actual results of the Closed Block to expected results from the glide path as part of the annual assessment of the current level of policyholder dividends. The assessment of policyholder dividends includes projections of future experience of the Closed Block policies and the investment experience of the Closed Block assets. The review of Closed Block experience also includes consideration of whether a policy dividend obligation should be recorded to reflect favorable Closed Block experience that has not yet been reflected in the dividend scales. See Note 5-Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe block where there are no dividends expected had a significant number of policies issued in December 1999 which had level premiums for the first 20 durations, followed by premiums which increased significantly in duration 21 as the premiums from that point forward go to an annually increasing scale. The approximate increase in premiums going from the 20th to the 21st duration is 1300%. Direct policies are a mixture of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly premium payment modes, whereas ceded policies are all annual premium mode. Therefore, both direct and ceded premiums increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2019 on the Closed Block compared to the prior year as this group of policies ended their level term with larger impacts affecting ceded premiums more than direct premiums as a result of these modal differences.\nMost of these policies lapsed in the first quarter of 2020. This caused a reversal of ceded premiums and a reduction in the direct due and unpaid premiums on the policies which lapsed. The lapsed policies also caused reversals of items such as ceding allowances, reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nCorporate Segment\nThe results of the Corporate Segment are as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from operations before income tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,822\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,985\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Loss\nThe net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.8 million to $10.8 million from a net loss of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to higher operating costs and expenses due to targeted growth initiatives and costs associated with being a public company and partially offset by $3.2 million of costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019.\nIntercompany Eliminations\nThe impact of the eliminations for intercompany transactions primarily consists of the sales by our Agency Segment of life products of our Insurance Segment. The eliminations represent the amounts required to eliminate the intercompany transactions as recorded in our segment results, and in particular, to eliminate any intersegment profits resulting from such transactions. Our segment results follow the accounting principles and methods applicable to each segment as if the intercompany transactions were with unaffiliated organizations:\nRevenue-our Agency Segment recognizes all commission revenue earned in the year the policy goes in force at the carrier.\nExpense-our Insurance Segment recognizes the first-year commission as a policy acquisition cost, in proportion to the premiums earned from providing insurance coverage throughout the first year that the policy is in force. In addition, our Insurance Segment defers the amount by which the first-year commission acquisition costs exceed the ultimate renewal commission and records this amount as deferred acquisition cost that is amortized over the expected life of the policy.\nViewed at the segment level, because of the timing difference between the Agency Segment's immediate recognition of commission revenue and the Insurance Segment's deferral and amortization of the commission expense over the expected life of the policy, all else being equal, the sale of a policy through our Agency Segment results in an intersegment profit in an amount equal to the difference between the commission paid and the related amortization expense. However, in consolidation, two impacts occur. First, the intercompany revenue recognized by our Agency Segment and the related deferred acquisition expense recorded by our Insurance Segment are eliminated. Second, we record deferred acquisition costs equal to that portion of Commission DAC that can be tied directly to Efinancial's expenses incurred in the successful placement of a policy. Therefore, in consolidation, the Commission DAC recorded in our Insurance Segment is effectively reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from Efinancial expenses that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC, which represents a majority of the Commission DAC, is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral under GAAP. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\u201d and Factors Affecting our Results-Strategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\u201d for more information.

This decrease of $3.3 million was mainly due to lower expense credit for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nInvestments\nInvestment Returns\nWe invest our available cash and funds that support our regulatory capital, surplus requirements and policy reserves in investment securities that are included in our Insurance and Corporate Segments. We earn income on these investments in the form of interest on fixed maturity securities (bonds and mortgage loans) and dividends (from equity holdings). Net investment income is recorded net of investment related expenses as revenue. The amount of net investment income that we recognize will vary depending on the amount of invested assets that we own, the types of investments we own, the interest rates earned and amount of dividends received on our investments.\nGains and losses on sales of investments are classified as net realized investment gains (losses) and are recorded as revenue. Capital appreciation and depreciation caused by changes in the market value of investments classified as available-for-sale\u201d is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of investment gains and losses that we recognize depends on the amount of and the types of invested assets we own and the market conditions related to those investments. Our cash needs can vary from time to time and could require that we sell invested assets to fund cash needs.\nInvestment Guidelines\nOur investment strategy and guidelines are developed by management and approved by the investment committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. Our investment strategy related to our Insurance Segment is designed to maintain a well-diversified, high quality fixed maturity portfolio that will provide adequate levels of net investment income and liquidity to meet our policyholder obligations under our life insurance policies and our assumed annuity deposits. To help maintain liquidity, we establish the duration of invested assets within a tolerance to the policy liability duration. The investments of our Insurance Segment are managed with an emphasis on current income within quality and diversification constraints. The focus is on book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio as the anticipated portfolio yield is a key element used in pricing our insurance products and establishing policyholder crediting rates on our annuity contracts.\nWe apply our overall investment strategy and guidelines on a consolidated basis for purposes of monitoring compliance with our overall guidelines. Almost all of our investments are owned by Fidelity Life and are maintained in compliance with insurance regulations. Critical guidelines of our investment plan include:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset concentration guidelines that limit the amount that we hold in any one issuer of securities,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset quality guidelines applied on a portfolio basis and for individual issues that establish a minimum asset quality standard for portfolios and establish minimum asset quality standards for investment purchases and investment holdings,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Liquidity guidelines that limit the amount of illiquid assets that can be held at any time, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Diversification guidelines that limit the exposure at any time to the total portfolio by investment sectors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment portfolios are all managed by third-party investment managers that specialize in insurance company asset management and in particular these managers are selected based upon their expertise in the particular asset classes that we own. We contract with an investment management firm to provide overall assistance with oversight of our portfolio managers, evaluation of investment performance and assistance with development and implementation of our investment strategy. This investment management firm reports to our Chief Financial Officer and to the Investment Committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if circumstances require, we review the performance of all portfolios and portfolio managers with the Investment Committee.\nThe following table shows the distribution of the fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale by quality rating, using the rating assigned by Standard & Poor's (S&P), a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. For securities where the S&P rating is not available (not rated), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) rating is used. Over the periods presented, we have maintained a consistent weighted average bond quality rating of A.\u201d The percentage allocation of total investment grade securities has decreased to 97.9% at December 31, 2020 from 98.2% at December 31, 2019 due to the S&P ratings on certain new securities acquired in our portfolio of distressed residential mortgage-backed securities.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S&P Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AAA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Not rated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment grade\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 355,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 308,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CCC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Not rated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total below investment grade\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 363,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the maturity profile of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The quarterly review is targeted to focus on securities with larger impairments and that have been in an impaired status for longer periods of time. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Polices-Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\u201d.\nNet Investment Income\nOne key measure of our net investment income is the book yield on our holdings of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, which holdings totaled $363.9 million and $314.9 million, and represented 85.7% and 77.2% of our invested assets, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Book yield is the effective interest rate, before investment expenses, that we earn on these investments. Book yield is calculated as the percent of net investment income to the average amortized cost of the underlying investments for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our book yield on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale was 3.9% and 4.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nIncluded with the future policy benefits is the liability for contract-holder deposits on deferred annuity contracts assumed through two reinsurance agreements effective in 1991 and 1992 and certain other policy funds left on deposit with the Company. The aggregate liability for deposits is as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ending\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year to\nDate\nInterest\nCredited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nCredit\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ending\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year to\nDate\nInterest\nCredited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nCredit\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annuity contract-holder deposits - assumed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends left on deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe liability for deferred annuity deposits represents the contract-holder account balances. Due to the declines in market interest rates and the book yield on our investment portfolio, we credit interest on all contract-holder deposit liabilities at contractual rates that are currently at the minimum rate allowed by the contract or by state regulations.\nOur Insurance Segment realizes operating profit from the excess of our book yield realized on fixed maturity securities that support our contract-holder deposits over the amount of interest that we credit to the contract-holder. We refer to this operating profit as the spread\u201d we earn on contract-holder deposits. Our book yields on fixed maturity investments have declined in recent periods due to current market conditions. If book yields continue to decline, the amount of spread between the interest earned and credited will be reduced.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nNet realized investment gains (losses) are subject to general economic trends and in particular correlate generally with movements in the major equity market indexes. The amounts classified as realized gains and losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations include amounts realized from sales of investments, mark-to-market adjustments on investments classified as equity holdings and investments that use the equity method of accounting (limited partnership interests which are included in Other invested assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities related to credit impairments.\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nUnrealized Holding Gains (Losses)\nWe also record capital appreciation/depreciation on our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had a change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from mark-to-market adjustments of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities totaling $7.8 million and $11.1 million (net of federal income taxes and reserve), respectively.\nSee Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nFinancial Position\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $768.8 million compared to total assets at December 31, 2019 of $721.8 million, an increase of $47.0 million. The invested asset base increased $16.9 million, primarily due to an increase in fixed maturity securities of $48.9 million, which includes $15.1 million of market value changes, offset by maturity of short-term investments of $29.8 million. Reinsurance recoverables increased $25.1 million as a result of a $22.4 million increase in ceded policy and claim reserves and an increase of $2.7 million related to timing of settlements of reinsured claims. Commission and agent balances increased $8.3 million due to the timing of collections. Deferred policy acquisition costs increased $1.4 million, primarily due to deferrals on new business in excess of amortization. Deferred income taxes increased $1.5 million, primarily due to a deferred tax credit as a result of net loss, partially offset by tax on unrealized investment market gains. Cash decreased $1.6 million, primarily related to cash used from investments, partially offset by cash from operating and financing activities. Other assets decreased $4.5 million, primarily due to decreases in due premium mostly on the Closed Block, partially offset by increases in internally developed software.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total liabilities of $573.5 million compared to total liabilities of $509.4 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.1 million. Future policy benefits and claims increased $45.8 million, primarily due to a $44.9 million increase in Core and Non-Core lines due to growth and maturity of the underlying blocks of business, and a $2.4 million increase in annuities and assumed life, primarily related to the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in the Closed Block. Other policyholder liabilities increased $12.7 million, primarily due to $11.2 million in Core and Non-Core lines and $1.7 million in Closed Block. Debt increased $9.9 million related to additional net borrowings under our commission financing agreement with Hannover Life. Other liabilities increased $6.3 million, primarily related to changes in operating accruals and chargeback allowances. Policyholder dividend obligations related to the Closed Block increased $1.8 million, primarily related to changes in the market value of invested assets. Reinsurance liabilities and payables decreased $8.7 million, primarily due to timing of reinsurance settlements and $3.6 million decrease in Policyholder account balances, largely due to annuity payments.\nAt December 31, 2020, total equity decreased to $195.2 million from $212.4 million at December 31, 2019. This decrease in equity of $17.2 million consists of a net loss of $25.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million of other comprehensive income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of funds are from premium revenues, commission revenues, net investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments. The Company's primary uses of funds are for payment of life policy benefits, contract-holder withdrawals on assumed annuity contracts, new business acquisition costs for our insurance operations (i.e., commissions, underwriting and issue costs), cost of sales for Agency operations (i.e., agent compensation, purchased lead and lead generation costs), general operating expenses and purchases of investments. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide funds periodically over time, through net investment income and maturities, to provide for the payment of policy benefits and contract-holder withdrawals.\nUnder our commission financing arrangement with Hannover Life, Fidelity Life is able to pay level annual commissions instead of first-year-only commissions to Efinancial for sales of RAPIDecision\u00ae Life policies, and Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to first-year-only commissions for sales of those policies. This arrangement reduces Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business while helping to provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions. We are able to obtain advances up to $30.0 million under our arrangement with Hannover Life. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nWe are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the FHLBC\u201d). As a member, we are able to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLBC. We own FHLBC common stock with a book value of $0.1 million, which allows us to borrow up to $2.3 million. Interest on borrowed funds is charged at variable rates established from time to time by the FHLBC based on the interest rate option selected at the time of the borrowing. There have been no borrowings under this facility.\nFidelity Life's ability to pay dividends to Vericity Holdings, Inc. (VHI) is limited by the insurance laws of the State of Illinois. All shareholder dividends are subject to notice filings with the Illinois Director of Insurance. The maximum amount of dividends that\ncan be paid by Illinois life insurance companies to shareholders without 30 days prior notice to the Illinois Director of Insurance is the greater of (i) statutory net income for the preceding year or (ii) 10% of statutory surplus as of the preceding year-end. Under Illinois insurance statutes, dividends may be paid only from surplus, excluding unrealized appreciation in value of investments, without prior approval. Dividends in excess of these amounts require advance approval of the Illinois Director of Insurance. There are no limitations on the amount of dividends that Efinancial can pay.\nDuring the years ended 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors of Fidelity Life approved the payment of $0.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in dividends to VHI. The dividends provided operating funds to VHI to support corporate operations and initiatives. Following the Conversion, Fidelity Life has agreed not to pay any common stock dividends without the approval of a majority of the company designees. In connection with the approval of the Conversion by the Illinois Director of Insurance, we agreed, for a period of twenty-four months following the completion of the offerings, to seek the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance for any declaration of an ordinary dividend by Fidelity Life.\nFidelity Life is a party to various services and cost sharing agreements with VHI and Efinancial pursuant to which certain costs and expenses incurred by VHI and Efinancial on behalf of Fidelity Life are allocated to Fidelity Life and reimbursed to the entity incurring the expense.\nWe have experienced net negative cash flows in 2020 and in most prior periods due to continued growth in sales of our life insurance products and in our Agency operations and through continued net withdrawals on assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. Our annuity deposits are in run-off because we do not market annuity contracts to generate annuity deposits to offset the withdrawal activity on in-force contracts.\nCash uses in our Insurance Segment result in negative operating cash flows related to sales of new insurance policies because:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Policy acquisition costs (consisting of agent commissions, policy underwriting and issue costs) exceed the amount of first year premium received from the policyholder,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Depending on the product sold, a portion or all of the agent's commission may be paid as a cash advance to the agent and most of the underwriting and policy issue costs are paid at the time the initial policy is issued, whereas the premiums may be paid throughout the policy year, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Amounts due from reinsurers to reimburse claims paid are usually paid at some date after the claim has been paid.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe resulting negative first year cash flows from sales of new policies are partially offset by positive cash flows from insurance policy renewals. The continued sales growth in our Insurance operations has resulted in a net cash decrease from operations. Cash flows from reinsurance collections will vary from period to period based on claims activity.\nOur Corporate Segment experienced negative cash flows as a result of the payment of allocated overhead expenses.\nCash flows from investing activities includes our fixed maturity securities and equity holdings that are classified as available-for-sale securities. Period to period, the cash flows associated with the changes in these portfolios will vary between cash sources and cash uses depending on portfolio trading due to investment market conditions and other factors.\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consists of the assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. The annuity liabilities are reducing each period due to cash withdrawals by contract-holders on this block of annuities that were primarily written in the late 1980s. Cash deposits to these annuity contracts are minimal compared to cash withdrawal activity. Also included in financing cash flows are net proceeds from our commission financing program.\nCash Flows\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Summary of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,790\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,754\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,615\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,600\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net decrease in cash of $1.6 million compared to net increase of $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash from operating activities increased by $8.1 million, mainly due to higher premium volume, partially offset by higher claim benefits and general operating expenses. Cash used by investing activities decreased, primarily due to net sales of short-term investments in 2020. In 2019, proceeds from the IPO were included in financing activities and partially offset in investing activities through the purchase of short-term investments.\nRisk-Based Capital\nFidelity Life is subject to regulatory guidelines related to the ratio of its capital level compared to its RBC level as determined by formulas adopted by state insurance departments and applicable to all life insurance companies. A company's authorized control level RBC\u201d is a measure of the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size, growth and risk profile. RBC standards are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions for insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions. Companies that do not maintain total adjusted RBC in excess of 200% of the company's authorized control level RBC may be required to take specific actions at the direction of state insurance regulators. Fidelity Life's total adjusted capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was well in excess of 200% of its authorized control level. See Business-Regulation-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\nDue to the continued growth in Fidelity Life's sales of new insurance policies and the dividends to VHI ($0.0 million in 2020 and $5.0 million in 2019 to provide working capital), Fidelity Life's statutory surplus has been declining. The accounting principles applicable to regulatory reporting require that insurance companies expense all policy acquisition costs as incurred. Acquisition expenses attributable to Fidelity Life's increasing new business growth have resulted in net losses being reported for regulatory reporting purposes. Regulatory accounting principles allow limited recognition of the future benefits of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we recognize no income tax benefit that would offset our operating losses for regulatory reporting purposes.\nFidelity Life is also subject to the model regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX.\u201d This regulation requires life insurance companies that issue insurance policies with level premium guarantees to carry reserves that can greatly exceed the amount that the insurance company believes is necessary to reflect its liability for future claims payments. Such reserves are sometimes referred to as non-economic reserves.\u201d Many insurance companies use reinsurance, financing, formation of captive reinsurers and other reserve financing transactions to reduce the regulatory capital needs under Regulation XXX. Generally, these solutions have only been available to carriers with much larger amounts of affected liabilities than Fidelity Life. To mitigate the future impact on regulatory capital from Regulation XXX and help stabilize our regulatory capital position in light of anticipated sales increases, we entered into a reserve financing agreement with Hannover Life effective July 1, 2013 that covered certain products with policies written on or before September 30, 2012. This agreement was first amended and restated as of July 1, 2016 and a subsequent amendment was filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance in November 2019 and approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance on December 23, 2019. The structure of the agreement, which was first effective July 1, 2013, involves a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and yearly renewable term reinsurance covering most of the Company's non-participating in-force life insurance business with issue dates on or before December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the reserve credit under this arrangement was approximately $181.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk\nWe own a diversified portfolio of investments including cash, bonds, commercial mortgages, and common stock. Each of these investments is subject, in varying degree, to market risk that can affect their return and their fair value. Bonds are the majority of our investments and include debt issues of corporations, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, or obligations of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and are classified as fixed maturity investments in our financial statements. Our investment portfolios are subject to market risks.\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices on the fair value of the investment securities that we own. We have exposure to market risk through our investment activities, including interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk and foreign currency risk. We have not and do not plan to enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk arises from the price sensitivity of investments to changes in interest rates. The changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates. As market interest rates fall the fixed income streams of fixed maturity investments held become more valuable and market values rise. As market interest rates rise, the opposite effect occurs. Interest rate risk can also arise if market rates fall, which can result in lower interest spreads on our assumed annuity deposits, which are our primary interest rate sensitive liability.\nWe review the interest rate sensitivity of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by calculating the impact on the market value of our holdings that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous shift in market interest rates across all maturities, which we consider to be reasonably possible. The impact of such a parallel shift upward in the yield curve of 200 basis points would reduce the market value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by $52.0 million (14.3%) and $41.3 million (13.1%) as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated market value changes assume all other factors are held constant and do not attempt to estimate any offsetting change in the value of our liabilities.\nWith regard to our assumed annuity deposits, we are subject to risk from contract-holder behavior resulting from changes in interest rates. The assumed annuity contracts have virtually no surrender charges remaining that could be assessed against withdrawals. When market interest rates exceed the amount that we are crediting on deposits, we are subject to higher contract-holder withdrawals or an increase in contract loans, both of which could force the Company to sell assets prematurely and could lead to the realization of capital losses on such sales. As of December 31, 2020, we were crediting interest at the minimum contract interest rate, which on a composite basis is approximately 3.9% annually. We manage our exposure to rising interest rates through our ability to increase the contract crediting rate. Our ability to increase our crediting rate is constrained by our portfolio yield at the time of the decision to increase rates. Increases in the contract crediting rates could reduce our income unless we are able to maintain a constant interest spread on our assets.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of loss due to an adverse change in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer or, in the case of a securitized investment, adverse change in the assets being securitized. We address credit risk by establishing minimum rating standards for investments that our portfolio managers can acquire and, in the case of a downgrade, continue to hold the investment. For our core fixed maturity portfolio, which comprises a significant majority of our invested assets, only investment grade securities (minimum credit rating for new investments is BBB- as established by Standard & Poor's or a comparable nationally recognized statistical rating organization) can be purchased and such portfolio managers must maintain an overall credit rating for the portfolio of at least A-. Through our portfolio managers, we monitor the financial condition of all the issues of securities that we own. As an additional step to reduce our exposure to credit risk, we have established diversification guidelines limiting the total amount of holding by issuer and by investment sector.\nEquity Market Risk\nEquity market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Adverse changes in equity prices can arise from both the movements of broad markets based on investor behavior or other general economic factors and also from adverse changes in an individual company's stock price. We manage our equity market risk primarily by limiting our exposure to individual issuers and by maintaining liquid holdings such that we are able to find a ready market should we want to lower our exposure to equity markets. Our individual stock holdings are managed by a specialty manager with portfolio guidelines that include limits on industry exposures and the size of investments in individual issuers. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $3.8 million and $5.2 million of exposure to equity market risk in our Insurance Segment through holdings of individual equity securities, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAll applicable adopted accounting pronouncements have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.", "item_7_truncated": "Analysis of Segment Results\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> Fair Value of Investments as of December 31, 2020\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 367,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, earned commissions were $43.4 million compared to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $4.0 million resulted from increased sales in the retail channel, which was primarily driven by increased agent headcount, partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale channel.\nNet investment income consists of income generated from our investment portfolio and is recorded net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income primarily consists of interest income earned on fixed maturity security investments and dividends earned on our equity holdings, net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income earned on assets required to support insurance reserves, annuity deposits and related regulatory capital requirements is allocated to our Insurance Segment. Any other net investment income is recorded in the Corporate Segment.\nEfinancial agents produced 88.6% and 86.8% of the direct policies written by Fidelity Life for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We plan to increase the number of policies sold through Efinancial as we pursue our strategic plan to further develop our controlled distribution platform and grow our book of business. However, sales of insurance policies through Efinancial immediately result in significantly higher consolidated expense recognition and lower consolidated net income in comparison to Fidelity Life policies distributed through an unaffiliated entity. GAAP requires that we immediately expense that portion of our policy acquisition costs for policies placed through Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the placement of a policy. As a result of this immediate expense recognition of the majority of policy acquisition costs of our sales through Efinancial, we incur a net loss in the first year on each policy sold through Efinancial. To the extent we are successful in increasing our premium writings through Efinancial over each of the next several years or more, we expect that the impact of recognizing a majority of Efinancial commissions as a current expense will, among other factors, continue to adversely affect our results of operations and contribute to our continuing to incur consolidated net losses and a reduction to our consolidated equity in each such year as we seek to implement our distribution strategy. Over the long term and assuming that our products perform consistent with our assumptions, once we have developed a sustainable book of business and our expected growth through Efinancial has leveled, we expect that revenues from policy renewals may begin to offset the immediate expense recognition resulting from writing new policies through Efinancial.

Since we acquired Efinancial in 2009, we have made significant investments in the development of our controlled distribution strategy for reaching our target market. By converting data we generate through our distribution platform into actionable insight using statistical analysis, we will seek to be more efficient in our acquisition and use of leads, improve our call center placement ratios and strive to achieve overall profitability.

The eliminations represent the amounts required to eliminate the intercompany transactions as recorded in our segment results, and in particular, to eliminate any intersegment profits resulting from such transactions. Our segment results follow the accounting principles and methods applicable to each segment as if the intercompany transactions were with unaffiliated organizations:\nOur mortgage loans are held on commercial real estate and are stated at the aggregate unpaid principal balances, net of any write-downs and valuation allowances. We identify loans for evaluation of impairment primarily based on the collection experience of each loan. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect principal or interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral. Impairments are included in net realized investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSecurities that are classified as available-for-sale are subject to market declines below amortized cost (a gross unrealized loss position). When a gross unrealized loss position occurs, the security is considered impaired. Quarterly or when necessary, we review each impaired security to identify whether the impairment may be other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) and require the recognition of an impairment loss in the current period earnings. Indication of OTTI includes potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or other company or industry specific concerns. A number of factors are considered in determining whether or not a decline in a specific security is other-than-temporary, including our current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. An impairment loss will be recorded if our intention is to sell an impaired security or it is considered to be more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and equity securities by fair value hierarchy was as follows:\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fidelity Life changed the commission structure related to Efinancial's sale of the RAPIDecision\u00ae Life to pay annual level commissions over the life of the product instead of heaped, or first-year-only commissions. This change reduced Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business by spreading its statutory commission expenses over the life of the policy instead of incurring it all in the policy year of issue. In order to help provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions, Fidelity Life and Efinancial entered into a financing arrangement with Hannover Life under which, on a monthly basis, Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to the first-year-only commissions on Fidelity Life RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business sold through Efinancial. In exchange, Efinancial assigns to Hannover Life its right to all future levelized commission payments on that business due from Fidelity Life, and Fidelity Life pays to Hannover Life the level commissions over the life of the contract. Our arrangement with Hannover Life allows us to finance up to $30.0 million of commission expense. Efinancial's ability to receive advances under this arrangement will terminate when the aggregate amount advanced under the arrangement equals or exceeds $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Adverse changes in equity prices can arise from both the movements of broad markets based on investor behavior or other general economic factors and also from adverse changes in an individual company's stock price.

Benefit expenses also include additions to the reserve for future policyholder benefits to recognize our estimated future obligations under the policies. Benefit expenses are shown net of amounts ceded under our reinsurance contracts. Our Insurance Segment also incurs policy acquisition costs that consist of commissions paid to agents, policy underwriting and issue costs and variable sales costs. A portion of these policy acquisition costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the insurance policies acquired during the period. In addition to policy acquisition costs, we incur expenses that vary based on the number of contracts that we have in-force, or variable policy administrative costs. These variable costs consist of expenses paid to third-party administrators based on rates for each policy administered. As the number of in-force policies increases, these expenses will increase. Conversely, when the number of in-force policies declines, variable policy expenses decline. Our insurance operations also incur overhead costs for functional and administrative staff to support insurance operations, financial reporting and information technology.

This decrease of $3.3 million was mainly due to lower expense credit for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nNon\u00adCore Life - Our Non\u00adCore Life business consists of: products that are currently being marketed but are not deemed to be of high strategic importance to the Company\u037e in\u00adforce policies from product lines introduced since Fidelity Life resumed independent operations in 2005, but were subsequently discontinued\u037e and an older annuity block of business that was not included in the Closed Block.\n \u2022 Persistency Experience. Many of the non-medically underwritten products that we issue have a limited amount of insurance industry information to use in developing policy lapse rates. We are developing our own historical experience as to expected lapse rates for these products and reflect our emerging experience in our pricing. If actual policy lapse rates exceed the lapse rates assumed in pricing our products, we may receive lower premium revenues and may not receive enough premium to cover all of our acquisition costs for the policy. \nBenefit expenses are recorded in our Insurance Segment. Benefit expenses include claims paid or payable on in-force insurance policies, as well as the change in our reserves for future policy benefits during the period. Benefit expenses are reduced by amounts ceded to reinsurance companies with whom we contract to share policy risks.\nLevel 1 securities include principally exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices for identical assets.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) are subject to general economic trends and in particular correlate generally with movements in the major equity market indexes. The amounts classified as realized gains and losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations include amounts realized from sales of investments, mark-to-market adjustments on investments classified as equity holdings and investments that use the equity method of accounting (limited partnership interests which are included in Other invested assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities related to credit impairments.\nThe resulting negative first year cash flows from sales of new policies are partially offset by positive cash flows from insurance policy renewals. The continued sales growth in our Insurance operations has resulted in a net cash decrease from operations. Cash flows from reinsurance collections will vary from period to period based on claims activity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe credit loss component of fixed maturity securities impairment is calculated as the difference between amortized cost of the security and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of cash flows discounted at the effective rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or prior impairment. The methodology and assumptions for estimating the cash flows vary depending on the type of security. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates, including prepayment assumptions, are based on data from widely accepted third-party sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss exists, and the security is considered to be temporarily impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, the security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The portion of the OTTI that is not considered a credit loss, is recognized as OTTI in accumulated comprehensive income.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nViewed at the segment level, because of the timing difference between the Agency Segment's immediate recognition of commission revenue and the Insurance Segment's deferral and amortization of the commission expense over the expected life of the policy, all else being equal, the sale of a policy through our Agency Segment results in an intersegment profit in an amount equal to the difference between the commission paid and the related amortization expense. However, in consolidation, two impacts occur. First, the intercompany revenue recognized by our Agency Segment and the related deferred acquisition expense recorded by our Insurance Segment are eliminated. Second, we record deferred acquisition costs equal to that portion of Commission DAC that can be tied directly to Efinancial's expenses incurred in the successful placement of a policy. Therefore, in consolidation, the Commission DAC recorded in our Insurance Segment is effectively reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from Efinancial expenses that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC, which represents a majority of the Commission DAC, is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral under GAAP. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\u201d and Factors Affecting our Results-Strategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\u201d for more information. The results of these elimination entries were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe forward-looking statements include, among other things, those items listed below:\nIn response to the economic impact related to COVID-19, concessions were granted to certain of the Company's mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications. At June 30, 2020, the Company held 25 mortgage loans where requests for temporary modifications were granted (23 were modified to interest only and 2 to forbearance). The total loan balance for these 25 loans amounted to $4.4 million or about 9% of the mortgage loan portfolio. At June 30, 2020, 17 of the 25 temporary loan modifications had returned to full payment (both principal and interest) under the modified loan terms, including the 2 loans given forbearance. Of the remaining 8 loans that were granted loan modifications, 7 of these loans returned to full payment status as of September 30. 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company granted a loan modification through December 31, 2020 on a loan that was outside of the original 25 loan modifications previously granted. The combined loan balance of the 2 loans under temporary modification status at December 31, 2020 amounted to $0.5 million, or less than 1% of the mortgage loan portfolio.\nOur Insurance Segment realizes operating profit from the excess of our book yield realized on fixed maturity securities that support our contract-holder deposits over the amount of interest that we credit to the contract-holder. We refer to this operating profit as the spread\u201d we earn on contract-holder deposits. Our book yields on fixed maturity investments have declined in recent periods due to current market conditions. If book yields continue to decline, the amount of spread between the interest earned and credited will be reduced.\n\nRevenues\nTotal Revenues\nThe Closed Block was funded based on a model developed to forecast the future cash flows of the Closed Block which is referred to as the glide path.\u201d The glide path model projected the anticipated future cash flows of the Closed Block as established at the initial funding. We compare the actual results of the Closed Block to expected results from the glide path as part of the annual assessment of the current level of policyholder dividends. The assessment of policyholder dividends includes projections of future experience of the Closed Block policies and the investment experience of the Closed Block assets. The review of Closed Block experience also includes consideration of whether a policy dividend obligation should be recorded to reflect favorable Closed Block experience that has not yet been reflected in the dividend scales. See Note 5-Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 the effect of legislative, judicial, economic, demographic and regulatory events in the jurisdictions where we do business; \nMost of these policies lapsed in the first quarter of 2020. This caused a reversal of ceded premiums and a reduction in the direct due and unpaid premiums on the policies which lapsed. The lapsed policies also caused reversals of items such as ceding allowances, reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe results of our Agency Segment were as follows:\nEquity Market Risk\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a 100% valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets related to the non-life subgroup of our tax return because we determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recoverable. The recording of the valuation allowance increases our federal income tax expense which in turn reduces our reported net income or increases our net loss as applicable. Our recorded net deferred tax asset is shown in the following table. The balances for each period are shown based on the life/non-life portions of the consolidated federal tax returns and in total.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking\u201d statements that are intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial and business performance. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as may,\u201d expects,\u201d should,\u201d believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d intends\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, statements that refer to our future financial performance, anticipated growth and trends in our business and in our industry and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nCash Flows\n \u2022 increased competition in our businesses, including the potential impacts of aggressive price competition by other insurance companies, payment of higher commissions to agents that could affect demand for our insurance products and impact the ability to grow and retain agents in our Agency Segment and the entry of new competitors and the development of new products by new or existing competitors, resulting in a reduction in the demand for our products and services; \nThe stress and disruption placed on the global economy and financial markets from the outbreak of COVID-19 may continue to have near and long-term negative effects on investment valuations, returns, and credit allowance exposure. The Company will continue to closely monitor the situation, including potential negative impacts on sales of new policies and mortality; however, due to the highly uncertain nature of these conditions, it is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of COVID-19 or its impact to the Company's operations, but the effect could be material.\nNational Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC\nUnder best estimate assumptions as to mortality, lapses, expenses, and investment yields, DAC is still recoverable on the Core Life and Non-Core Life products (Open Block), Closed Block, and assumed life line of business. The annuities line has no remaining DAC, and under best estimate assumptions on that line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\n \u2022 Amounts due from reinsurers to reimburse claims paid are usually paid at some date after the claim has been paid. \nSee Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWith regard to our assumed annuity deposits, we are subject to risk from contract-holder behavior resulting from changes in interest rates. The assumed annuity contracts have virtually no surrender charges remaining that could be assessed against withdrawals. When market interest rates exceed the amount that we are crediting on deposits, we are subject to higher contract-holder withdrawals or an increase in contract loans, both of which could force the Company to sell assets prematurely and could lead to the realization of capital losses on such sales. As of December 31, 2020, we were crediting interest at the minimum contract interest rate, which on a composite basis is approximately 3.9% annually. We manage our exposure to rising interest rates through our ability to increase the contract crediting rate. Our ability to increase our crediting rate is constrained by our portfolio yield at the time of the decision to increase rates. Increases in the contract crediting rates could reduce our income unless we are able to maintain a constant interest spread on our assets.\nLoss from Operations Before Income Taxes\n\nNet realized investment gains (losses) result from sales of investment securities and OTTI for estimated credit losses of fixed maturity securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total liabilities of $573.5 million compared to total liabilities of $509.4 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.1 million. Future policy benefits and claims increased $45.8 million, primarily due to a $44.9 million increase in Core and Non-Core lines due to growth and maturity of the underlying blocks of business, and a $2.4 million increase in annuities and assumed life, primarily related to the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in the Closed Block. Other policyholder liabilities increased $12.7 million, primarily due to $11.2 million in Core and Non-Core lines and $1.7 million in Closed Block. Debt increased $9.9 million related to additional net borrowings under our commission financing agreement with Hannover Life. Other liabilities increased $6.3 million, primarily related to changes in operating accruals and chargeback allowances. Policyholder dividend obligations related to the Closed Block increased $1.8 million, primarily related to changes in the market value of invested assets. Reinsurance liabilities and payables decreased $8.7 million, primarily due to timing of reinsurance settlements and $3.6 million decrease in Policyholder account balances, largely due to annuity payments.\nRecapture of Assumed Life Business\nDAC amortization represents the actuarially determined reduction in the DAC asset for the period. The amount of acquisition cost amortization recognized each period is based on actual factors established when the insurance contracts were written.\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nClosed Block - Our Closed Block represents all in\u00adforce participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. The Closed Block was established in connection with our 2007 reorganization into a mutual holding company structure and represents all in-force participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. Annuities and assumed life represent (i) our assumed life business, which consists of policies primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s; (ii) our direct annuity contracts, which consist of approximately 77 structured settlement contracts that remain from a group of contracts entered into in the late 1980s; and (iii) our assumed annuities, which consist of contract-holder deposits assumed from a former affiliate under two coinsurance treaties entered into in 1991 and 1992. The 2019 demutualization of Members Mutual Holding Company had no impact on how the Closed Block is structured.\nSee Note 2-Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe liability for deferred annuity deposits represents the contract-holder account balances. Due to the declines in market interest rates and the book yield on our investment portfolio, we credit interest on all contract-holder deposit liabilities at contractual rates that are currently at the minimum rate allowed by the contract or by state regulations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total benefits and expenses were $175.1 million compared to $155.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $19.6 million was primarily due to higher life, annuity, and health claim benefits.\n \u2022 Depending on the product sold, a portion or all of the agent's commission may be paid as a cash advance to the agent and most of the underwriting and policy issue costs are paid at the time the initial policy is issued, whereas the premiums may be paid throughout the policy year, and \n\nOperating expenses are incurred by all of our segments. The operating expenses of our Insurance Segment include policy acquisition costs in excess of amounts that qualify for deferral, ceding commissions received on ceded reinsurance in excess of amounts deferred, variable policy administration costs, general overhead and administration costs, and insurance premium taxes and assessments paid to various states. Agency Segment expenses consist of compensation paid to employee sales agents, costs of insurance sales leads (marketing), costs of sales management and support activities, agent licensing expenses and general overhead and administration expenses. The expenses of the Corporate Segment include allocation of a portion of the compensation of senior executives related to corporate activities, Board of Director expenses related to corporate business, and other operating costs considered to be of a corporate nature and not directly related to either of our other business segments. Overhead and administrative expenses of the segments include employee costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits), office rent, information technology and costs of third-party administrators and other contractors.\nConsequently, such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as our current plans, estimates and beliefs with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. Except as required under the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and do not undertake, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances after the date of such statements.\nPrincipal Revenue & Expense Items\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenues were $147.8 million compared to $135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $12.5 million primarily resulted from higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions, partially offset by decreases in net investment income, realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales.\nOther Income\nThe net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.8 million to $10.8 million from a net loss of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to higher operating costs and expenses due to targeted growth initiatives and costs associated with being a public company and partially offset by $3.2 million of costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019.\n\nIncome Taxes\nEvery quarter, we review all investments where the market value is less than the carrying value to ascertain if the impairment of the security's value is OTTI. The quarterly review is targeted to focus on securities with larger impairments and that have been in an impaired status for longer periods of time. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Polices-Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\u201d.\nNet Loss\nInterest rate risk arises from the price sensitivity of investments to changes in interest rates. The changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates. As market interest rates fall the fixed income streams of fixed maturity investments held become more valuable and market values rise. As market interest rates rise, the opposite effect occurs. Interest rate risk can also arise if market rates fall, which can result in lower interest spreads on our assumed annuity deposits, which are our primary interest rate sensitive liability.\n \u2022 Diversification guidelines that limit the exposure at any time to the total portfolio by investment sectors. \nAgency Segment\nUnrealized Holding Gains (Losses)\nNon-Core Life lines. In addition, there was $1.0 million increase in depreciation costs and $1.1 million in staff costs. The increases were partially offset by $1.8 million costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019. See Closed Block\u201d section in this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding Closed Block and Note 8- Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an estimated $4.3 million in net incurred policyholder claims that included COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death.\n \u2022 the inability to manage future growth and integration of our operations; and \n\n \u2022 future mortality increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.05 for all life blocks, \nFidelity Life is also subject to the model regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX.\u201d This regulation requires life insurance companies that issue insurance policies with level premium guarantees to carry reserves that can greatly exceed the amount that the insurance company believes is necessary to reflect its liability for future claims payments. Such reserves are sometimes referred to as non-economic reserves.\u201d Many insurance companies use reinsurance, financing, formation of captive reinsurers and other reserve financing transactions to reduce the regulatory capital needs under Regulation XXX. Generally, these solutions have only been available to carriers with much larger amounts of affected liabilities than Fidelity Life. To mitigate the future impact on regulatory capital from Regulation XXX and help stabilize our regulatory capital position in light of anticipated sales increases, we entered into a reserve financing agreement with Hannover Life effective July 1, 2013 that covered certain products with policies written on or before September 30, 2012. This agreement was first amended and restated as of July 1, 2016 and a subsequent amendment was filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance in November 2019 and approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance on December 23, 2019. The structure of the agreement, which was first effective July 1, 2013, involves a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and yearly renewable term reinsurance covering most of the Company's non-participating in-force life insurance business with issue dates on or before December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the reserve credit under this arrangement was approximately $181.4 million.\nIf we believe the pricing information received from third-party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs observable in the market, we may challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service. Historically, we have not challenged or updated the prices provided by third-party pricing services. However, any such updates by a pricing service to be more consistent with the presented market observations, or any adjustments made by us to prices provided by third-party pricing services, would be reflected in the balance sheet for the current period.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nOur principal sources of funds are from premium revenues, commission revenues, net investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments. The Company's primary uses of funds are for payment of life policy benefits, contract-holder withdrawals on assumed annuity contracts, new business acquisition costs for our insurance operations (i.e., commissions, underwriting and issue costs), cost of sales for Agency operations (i.e., agent compensation, purchased lead and lead generation costs), general operating expenses and purchases of investments. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide funds periodically over time, through net investment income and maturities, to provide for the payment of policy benefits and contract-holder withdrawals.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future claims payments to policyholders using actuarial assumptions in accordance with industry practice and GAAP. Many factors affect these reserves, including mortality trends, policy persistency and investment returns. We establish our reserves based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience.\nThe primary reserve method that is used in calculation of our future policy benefit reserves is the net level premium method. The net level premium method requires that the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use a number of actuarial assumptions that represent management's best estimate at the time the contract was issued with the addition of a margin for adverse deviation. Actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, mortality, policy persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a loss before taxes of $27.3 million compared to a loss before taxes of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increased loss of $7.1 million was primarily due to increases in life, annuity, and health claim benefits and decreases in net investment income, net realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales, partially offset by higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions.\nLevel 1-Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets the Company can access.\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nOur investment portfolios are all managed by third-party investment managers that specialize in insurance company asset management and in particular these managers are selected based upon their expertise in the particular asset classes that we own. We contract with an investment management firm to provide overall assistance with oversight of our portfolio managers, evaluation of investment performance and assistance with development and implementation of our investment strategy. This investment management firm reports to our Chief Financial Officer and to the Investment Committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if circumstances require, we review the performance of all portfolios and portfolio managers with the Investment Committee.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred taxes for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. Under GAAP, we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. To the extent that we are required to establish an additional valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, the amount of such valuation allowance would generally be charged against our net income for the period in which that valuation allowance is established.\nassumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience, market indicators and other relevant factors and circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may affect our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 future investment yield assumptions were lowered by 50 basis points. \nInsurance Segment\nIn connection with our premium deficiency testing, we performed sensitivity analyses on our Open Block, Closed Block, annuities, and assumed life business lines to capture the effect that certain key assumptions have on expected future cash flows, and the impact of those assumptions on the adequacy of DAC balances and GAAP benefit reserves. The sensitivity tests are performed independently, without consideration for any correlation among the key assumptions.\nFidelity Life is subject to regulatory guidelines related to the ratio of its capital level compared to its RBC level as determined by formulas adopted by state insurance departments and applicable to all life insurance companies. A company's authorized control level RBC\u201d is a measure of the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size, growth and risk profile. RBC standards are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions for insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions. Companies that do not maintain total adjusted RBC in excess of 200% of the company's authorized control level RBC may be required to take specific actions at the direction of state insurance regulators. Fidelity Life's total adjusted capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was well in excess of 200% of its authorized control level. See Business-Regulation-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\n \u2022 Mortality Experience. We use our historical experience combined with experience projections from our reinsurance partners to develop our assumptions for the level, frequency and pattern of future claims experience. In our Insurance Segment, we principally issue non-medically underwritten products through underwriting processes that generally have limited recent company and industry experience; therefore, their performance may be less reliable and subject to greater variance than products underwritten through processes with more established industry experience. \nThe Agency Segment's main source of revenue is commissions earned on the sale of insurance policies sold through our retail channel. Efinancial's employee agents utilize insurance sales leads to contact or be contacted by potential customers and then work with the customers to complete the sales process, which can occur during the initial contact or within 24 to 48 hours for non-medically underwritten policies. In our wholesale channel, we subcontract with our independent agents who sell through Efinancial's contracts with its unaffiliated insurance carriers. In consideration for using our carrier contracts and services, we receive a portion of the commission earned by the independent agent from the carrier.\nFinancial Position\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $768.8 million compared to total assets at December 31, 2019 of $721.8 million, an increase of $47.0 million. The invested asset base increased $16.9 million, primarily due to an increase in fixed maturity securities of $48.9 million, which includes $15.1 million of market value changes, offset by maturity of short-term investments of $29.8 million. Reinsurance recoverables increased $25.1 million as a result of a $22.4 million increase in ceded policy and claim reserves and an increase of $2.7 million related to timing of settlements of reinsured claims. Commission and agent balances increased $8.3 million due to the timing of collections. Deferred policy acquisition costs increased $1.4 million, primarily due to deferrals on new business in excess of amortization. Deferred income taxes increased $1.5 million, primarily due to a deferred tax credit as a result of net loss, partially offset by tax on unrealized investment market gains. Cash decreased $1.6 million, primarily related to cash used from investments, partially offset by cash from operating and financing activities. Other assets decreased $4.5 million, primarily due to decreases in due premium mostly on the Closed Block, partially offset by increases in internally developed software.\nNet (Loss) Income\nStrategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\n \u2022 costs, availability and collectability of reinsurance; \nAccuracy of Our Pricing Assumptions\nReconciliation of Segment Results to Consolidated Results\nNet Investment Income\nThe Company continues to monitor the effects of the changing economic environment on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and currently have a number of securities on our watch list, which are mainly concentrated in the oil and gas and airline sectors. Our assessment through December 31, 2020 has resulted in no additional material other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI) due to COVID-19 and the recent market events.\nRegarding this sensitivity testing for the annuities line, there is no remaining DAC due to the age of the contracts. As such, these sensitivity runs tested the adequacy of the benefit reserves for this line. For the annuities line, a drop in investment yield of 50 basis points would result in a required reserve increase of $0.7 million, while for the mortality scenario and the lapse scenario there would be no impact to benefit reserves.\nInsurance Segment\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\n \u2022 changes in industry trends and financial strength ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. \nWe provide life insurance protection targeted to the middle American market. We believe there is a substantial unmet need for life insurance, particularly among domestic households with annual incomes of between $50,000 and $125,000, a market we refer to as our target Middle Market. We differentiate our product and service offerings through innovative product design and sales processes, with an emphasis on rapidly issued products that are not medically underwritten at the time of sale.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nInvestment Guidelines\nThe following table shows the distribution of the fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale by quality rating, using the rating assigned by Standard & Poor's (S&P), a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. For securities where the S&P rating is not available (not rated), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) rating is used. Over the periods presented, we have maintained a consistent weighted average bond quality rating of A.\u201d The percentage allocation of total investment grade securities has decreased to 97.9% at December 31, 2020 from 98.2% at December 31, 2019 due to the S&P ratings on certain new securities acquired in our portfolio of distressed residential mortgage-backed securities.\nAnnuities and Assumed Life - We have assumed reinsurance commitments with respect to annuity contract-holder deposits and a block of life insurance contracts that were ceded by former affiliates of Fidelity Life. On March 29, 2019, one of these former affiliates recaptured the majority of the assumed block of life business. The annuity deposits were ceded to Fidelity Life through two contracts entered into in the early 1990s. These annuity and assumed life deposits are now largely in run\u00adoff, with only minor amounts of new deposits each year. There are minimal remaining surrender charges associated with the assumed annuity contracts.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our DAC asset as part of our premium deficiency testing. If a premium deficiency exists, we reduce DAC by the amount of the deficiency through a charge to current period earnings (loss). If the deficiency is more than the recognized DAC balance, we reduce the DAC balance to zero and increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess with a corresponding charge to current period earnings (loss). See Future Policy Benefit Reserves\u201d below for more information on premium deficiency testing.\nThere was OTTI on fixed maturity securities in the amount of $68 thousand and $41 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\nCredit Risk\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFor our Insurance Segment, other income primarily consists of cost of insurance charges on universal life contracts.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest credited was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $0.1 million was due to lower interest credited on assumed fixed annuity contract-holder account balances.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThis segment primarily consists of the operations of Efinancial. Efinancial is a call center-based insurance agency that markets life insurance for Fidelity Life and unaffiliated insurance companies. Efinancial's primary operations are conducted through employee agents from three call center locations, which we refer to as our retail channel. In addition, Efinancial operates as a wholesale agency, assisting independent agents that desire to work for the carriers that Efinancial represents, which we refer to as our wholesale channel.\nFactors Affecting Our Results\nInterest income from mortgage loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method. Accrual of income is generally suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Mortgage loans are considered past due when full principal or interest payments have not been received according to contractual terms.\ncan be paid by Illinois life insurance companies to shareholders without 30 days prior notice to the Illinois Director of Insurance is the greater of (i) statutory net income for the preceding year or (ii) 10% of statutory surplus as of the preceding year-end. Under Illinois insurance statutes, dividends may be paid only from surplus, excluding unrealized appreciation in value of investments, without prior approval. Dividends in excess of these amounts require advance approval of the Illinois Director of Insurance. There are no limitations on the amount of dividends that Efinancial can pay.\nEfinancial also generates insurance lead sales revenue through its eCoverage web presence. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our Agency Segment revenue earned 85% and 78% through the retail channel, 5% and 8% through the wholesale channel, and 10% and 14% through insurance lead sales revenue, respectively.\nCore Life - Our Core Life insurance business is the primary business of the Insurance Segment. Core Life represents a significant portion of the insurance business written by Fidelity Life since it resumed independent operations in 2005. Our Core Life business consists of in\u00adforce policies that are considered to be of high strategic importance to Fidelity Life.\nDuring the years ended 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors of Fidelity Life approved the payment of $0.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in dividends to VHI. The dividends provided operating funds to VHI to support corporate operations and initiatives. Following the Conversion, Fidelity Life has agreed not to pay any common stock dividends without the approval of a majority of the company designees. In connection with the approval of the Conversion by the Illinois Director of Insurance, we agreed, for a period of twenty-four months following the completion of the offerings, to seek the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance for any declaration of an ordinary dividend by Fidelity Life.\nAll applicable adopted accounting pronouncements have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nFor the assumed life line of business sensitivity testing, there is also no remaining DAC. Under all the sensitivity tests on this line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nInvestments\nIn the second quarter 2020, Fidelity Life entered into a General Agent's agreement with an unaffiliated third party, National Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC ( AmeriLife\u201d). This agreement provides Fidelity Life access to AmeriLife distribution channels, its commission systems and assists in streamlining administrative processes related to commissions. This agreement also allows Efinancial to operate as a sub agent to AmeriLife. On May 15, 2020, the Company began selling products using this new distribution arrangement.\nOur investment strategy and guidelines are developed by management and approved by the investment committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. Our investment strategy related to our Insurance Segment is designed to maintain a well-diversified, high quality fixed maturity portfolio that will provide adequate levels of net investment income and liquidity to meet our policyholder obligations under our life insurance policies and our assumed annuity deposits. To help maintain liquidity, we establish the duration of invested assets within a tolerance to the policy liability duration. The investments of our Insurance Segment are managed with an emphasis on current income within quality and diversification constraints. The focus is on book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio as the anticipated portfolio yield is a key element used in pricing our insurance products and establishing policyholder crediting rates on our annuity contracts.\n \u2022 future economic conditions in the markets in which we compete that could be less favorable than expected and could have impacts on demand for our products and services; \nRevenue-our Agency Segment recognizes all commission revenue earned in the year the policy goes in force at the carrier.\nWe have not accepted new policies in these legacy lines since 2006 or prior, and these lines are considered to be in run-off\u201d with a declining number of policies in force each period. We recognize income on the Closed Block, and annuities and assumed life to the extent that premium revenues and net investment income exceed the benefit expenses and operating expenses (including paid and accrued policyholder dividends) of these lines of business. On the two annuity lines, we recognize income (loss) to the extent that our net investment income earned exceeds (are less than) benefit expenses (direct annuities) and amounts credited on policy deposits (assumed annuities) and operating expenses of the two lines.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our income tax benefit was $2.3 million compared to an income tax benefit of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased benefit of $1.4 million reflects increased net loss attributable to the life sub-group. The non-life sub-group, which has a full valuation allowance, therefore no tax impact. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes.\u201d\nOur consolidated DAC will be lower relative to other insurance companies that utilize unaffiliated distributors. GAAP does not permit the deferral of commission revenues paid to Efinancial, our affiliated agency, in excess of those expenses actually incurred by Efinancial in the placement of the policy. Because we are focused on increasing insurance premium volume through Efinancial, our operating results will reflect higher current period expenses and lower current reported net income. Therefore, in consolidation, the first-year commission acquisition costs ( Commission DAC\u201d) recorded in our Insurance Segment is reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from expenses of Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral. As a result of recognizing a majority of expenses for the Efinancial sales immediately, we will recognize a charge against our consolidated earnings (loss) and consolidated equity in the amount of such expenses for the period in which they are incurred. See Results of Operations-Analysis of Segment Results-Corporate Segment-Intercompany Eliminations.\u201d\nBenefits and Expenses\nMortgage Loans\nOur fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale\u201d securities, which are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. For investments that are not actively traded, the determination of fair value requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Fair value determinations include consideration of both observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. Security pricing is applied using a hierarchy approach.\nlines of business using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without provision for adverse deviation. If benefit reserves minus the DAC asset are less than the present value of future cash flows on the line of business, then first the DAC asset will be reduced. If reducing the DAC asset down to zero is still not sufficient to eliminate the premium deficiency, then benefit reserves will be increased. Recognizing a premium deficiency will reduce our reported net income or increase our reported loss, for the period.\nThe results of our Insurance Segment were as follows:\nThe amortization of DAC for traditional life insurance products is determined as a level proportion of premium based on actuarial methods and assumptions about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments, established by us at the time the policy is issued. GAAP requires that assumptions for these types of products not be modified while the policy is outstanding. Amortization is adjusted each period to reflect policy lapse or termination rates compared to anticipated experience. Accordingly, acceleration of DAC amortization could occur if policies terminate earlier than originally assumed. We establish the assumptions used to determine DAC amortization based on estimates using Company experience and other relevant information that is used to price the products. We monitor our actual experience and will update the actuarial factors applied to future policy issues if warranted. The selection of actuarial assumptions requires considerable judgment and has inherent uncertainty. Should actual policy lapse experience be higher than that assumed during a reporting period, we will amortize our DAC balance faster and report lower net income.\nThe interest credited primarily relates to amounts that contract-holders earn on any contract-holder deposits from our assumed annuity contracts and other amounts left on deposit with us. Our universal life policies and assumed annuity contracts require Fidelity Life to periodically establish the crediting rate to be paid on policyholder and contract-holder deposits. All current assumed annuity contracts are credited with interest at the minimum interest rate guaranteed in the contract. Interest credited relates solely to our Insurance Segment.\n \u2022 the potential impact on our reported net income that could result from the adoption of future accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies; \nNet Premiums\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRisk-Based Capital\nWe own a diversified portfolio of investments including cash, bonds, commercial mortgages, and common stock. Each of these investments is subject, in varying degree, to market risk that can affect their return and their fair value. Bonds are the majority of our investments and include debt issues of corporations, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, or obligations of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and are classified as fixed maturity investments in our financial statements. Our investment portfolios are subject to market risks.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\nDue to the continued growth in Fidelity Life's sales of new insurance policies and the dividends to VHI ($0.0 million in 2020 and $5.0 million in 2019 to provide working capital), Fidelity Life's statutory surplus has been declining. The accounting principles applicable to regulatory reporting require that insurance companies expense all policy acquisition costs as incurred. Acquisition expenses attributable to Fidelity Life's increasing new business growth have resulted in net losses being reported for regulatory reporting purposes. Regulatory accounting principles allow limited recognition of the future benefits of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we recognize no income tax benefit that would offset our operating losses for regulatory reporting purposes.\nUnder our commission financing arrangement with Hannover Life, Fidelity Life is able to pay level annual commissions instead of first-year-only commissions to Efinancial for sales of RAPIDecision\u00ae Life policies, and Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to first-year-only commissions for sales of those policies. This arrangement reduces Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business while helping to provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions. We are able to obtain advances up to $30.0 million under our arrangement with Hannover Life. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.\nEarned Commission\n \u2022 Policy acquisition costs (consisting of agent commissions, policy underwriting and issue costs) exceed the amount of first year premium received from the policyholder, \nNet Investment Income\nThe calculation of future policy reserves requires the use of significant judgment and is inherently uncertain. If our actual experience differs from the experience assumed in establishing our reserves, the impact of these differences is reflected in the results of operations in each period. If actual claims are higher than assumed claims experience, our reported income (loss) will be reduced (increased) for the periods in which this experience occurs. If actual policy lapses are higher than that assumed, our future policy benefit reserves will be reduced for the period in which this experience occurs.\nAgency Segment\nLevel 3-Fair values are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. Level 3 instruments include less liquid securities for which significant inputs are unobservable in the market, such as structured securities with complex features that require significant management assumptions or estimation in the fair value measurement. Level 3 hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nEarned commission revenue consists of amounts received and due from insurance carriers on policies sold by Efinancial and is recorded in our Agency Segment. However, the commission revenue from sales of Fidelity Life policies is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations because Efinancial and Fidelity Life are affiliated.\nNet (Loss) Income\nEarned Commissions\nFor our Insurance Segment, the costs of acquiring new business are deferred to the extent that they are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions paid in the first policy year that are in excess of the ultimate renewal commissions payable on the policy. For any of our policies for which we do not pay renewal commissions, the deferred acquisition costs (at the segment level) include all commissions paid in the first year. For policies for which we pay levelized commissions over the life of the policy, we expense the first-year commission and therefore do not defer any other commission expense. We also defer costs associated with policy underwriting and issuance related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Non-deferred first year acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred include expenses that do not meet the definition of a deferrable cost, which includes the acquisition costs incurred on insurance applications that do not result in an in-force policy (unsuccessful efforts).\nIn our Agency Segment, insurance lead sales revenue consists of (i) click-through revenues we generate when leads click through to our webpages to access information about life insurance options sponsored by another company and (ii) data revenues we generate through the sale of information regarding leads.\nDue to the valuation allowance on the non-life subgroup, the effective income tax rate reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Operations will vary depending on the portion of our pretax income (loss) that results from our life subgroup and the portion from our non-life subgroup. With the current full valuation allowance, the current tax benefit related to our non-life subgroup is limited. We continue to record tax expense (benefit) related to the pretax income (loss) of our life subgroup.\nOur review of our available-for-sale securities for impairment includes an analysis of impaired securities in terms of severity and/or age of the gross unrealized loss. Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the issuer of the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the likelihood for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential that includes the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, collateral position, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether expected cash flows will be sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nNet premiums consist of direct life insurance premiums due and collected from our policyholders on in-force insurance policies and premiums collected on assumed life reinsurance contracts, less reinsurance premiums paid to reinsurers. Direct premiums are recorded in our Insurance Segment and classified as first year premiums when they relate to the first calendar year coverage period. Premiums for policies outside their first calendar year are called renewal premiums.\nLevel 2-This level includes fixed maturity securities priced principally by independent pricing services using observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; and model-derived valuations for which all significant inputs are observable market data. Level 2 instruments include most corporate debt securities and U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities that are valued by models using inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. You should review Forward Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nIncluded with the future policy benefits is the liability for contract-holder deposits on deferred annuity contracts assumed through two reinsurance agreements effective in 1991 and 1992 and certain other policy funds left on deposit with the Company. The aggregate liability for deposits is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $16.7 million compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.6 million includes a $2.2 million decrease in Closed Block, primarily due to lapses partially offset by an increase in our Core and Non-Core lines of $0.6 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 the inability to maintain or grow our strategic partnerships or our inability to realize the expected benefits from our relationship with the Standby Purchaser; \nVericity, Inc. Consolidated Results of Operations\nWe apply our overall investment strategy and guidelines on a consolidated basis for purposes of monitoring compliance with our overall guidelines. Almost all of our investments are owned by Fidelity Life and are maintained in compliance with insurance regulations. Critical guidelines of our investment plan include:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, life, annuity and health claim benefits were $77.7 million compared with $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $15.8 million was mainly attributable to an increase of $4.8 million in net claim benefits resulting from $6.8 million higher claim activity on certain Core and Non-Core products, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in annuities and assumed life. Change in benefit reserves increased $11.1 million, primarily related to $1.4 million in our Core and Non-Core lines, $5.9 million in Closed Block and $4.4 million in assumed life resulting from the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in annuities.\nThe results of this segment consist of net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) earned on invested assets. We also include certain corporate expenses that are not allocated to our other segments, including expenses of Vericity, Inc., board expenses, allocation of executive management time spent on corporate matters, and financial reporting and auditing costs related to our consolidation and internal controls. Our Corporate Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) exceed (are less than) corporate expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net insurance premiums were $108.0 million compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $13.6 million was primarily due to growth in our Core Life lines of $5.9 million, mainly driven by increases in LifeTime Benefit Term (LBT) and RAPIDecision\u00ae Life and a $7.1 million increase in Closed Block and annuities of $0.5 million.\nWhen the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3).\nForward-Looking Statements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net decrease in cash of $1.6 million compared to net increase of $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash from operating activities increased by $8.1 million, mainly due to higher premium volume, partially offset by higher claim benefits and general operating expenses. Cash used by investing activities decreased, primarily due to net sales of short-term investments in 2020. In 2019, proceeds from the IPO were included in financing activities and partially offset in investing activities through the purchase of short-term investments.\nAt December 31, 2020, total equity decreased to $195.2 million from $212.4 million at December 31, 2019. This decrease in equity of $17.2 million consists of a net loss of $25.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million of other comprehensive income.\nWe are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the FHLBC\u201d). As a member, we are able to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLBC. We own FHLBC common stock with a book value of $0.1 million, which allows us to borrow up to $2.3 million. Interest on borrowed funds is charged at variable rates established from time to time by the FHLBC based on the interest rate option selected at the time of the borrowing. There have been no borrowings under this facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Agency Segment incurred a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net loss of $6.2 million was primarily the result of higher earned commissions and a reduction of operating costs and expenses, partially offset by lower insurance lead sales revenue.\n \u2022 Liquidity guidelines that limit the amount of illiquid assets that can be held at any time, and \nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe major components of operating revenues, benefits and expenses and net (loss) income are as follows:\nFidelity Life engages in the following business lines:\n \u2022 the effect of challenges to our patents and other intellectual property; \nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The measures governments worldwide have enacted to combat the pandemic have resulted in disruptions in global and local supply chains and have led to adverse impacts on economic and market conditions as well as increases in unemployment. The severity of COVID-19 and duration of government containment actions have impacted both employees and customers of the Company and presented material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company's performance, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAll of the fair values of our fixed maturity and equity securities within Level 2 are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services. All of our prices for each security are generally sourced from multiple pricing vendors, and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type and region of the world, based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. We ultimately use the price from the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type and region. For fixed maturity securities that do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications which incorporate a variety of inputs including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and U.S. Treasury curves. Specifically, for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Securities with validated quotes from pricing services are reflected within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as they generally are based on observable pricing for similar assets or other market significant observable inputs.\nOur Insurance Segment revenues consist of net insurance premiums, net investment income, and net realized gains (losses) on investments. Our distributors consist of Efinancial and the independent insurance agencies that we contract with to sell our insurance products to the customers (policyholders) who buy our insurance policies. We recognize premium revenue from our policyholders. We purchase reinsurance coverage to help manage the risk on our insurance policies by paying, or ceding, a portion of the policyholder premiums to the reinsurance companies. Our net insurance premiums reflect amounts collected from policyholders, plus premiums assumed under reinsurance agreements less premiums ceded to reinsurance companies. Net investment income represents primarily interest income earned on fixed maturity securities that we purchase with cash flows from our premium revenues. We also realize gains and losses on sales of investment securities. These investments support our liability for policy reserves and provide the capital required to operate our insurance business. Capital requirements are primarily established by regulatory authorities. See Note 2-Investments\u201d and Business-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\n \u2022 our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities either through acquisitions or organically; \nFidelity Life is a party to various services and cost sharing agreements with VHI and Efinancial pursuant to which certain costs and expenses incurred by VHI and Efinancial on behalf of Fidelity Life are allocated to Fidelity Life and reimbursed to the entity incurring the expense.\nNet Investment Income\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nFidelity Life's ability to pay dividends to Vericity Holdings, Inc. (VHI) is limited by the insurance laws of the State of Illinois. All shareholder dividends are subject to notice filings with the Illinois Director of Insurance. The maximum amount of dividends that\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss was $8.3 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net loss of $7.1 million resulted primarily from higher life, annuity and health claim benefits, lower net investment income, lower net realized gains and increases in net operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in net insurance premiums and lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity profile of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalty.\nClosed Block\nWe conduct our business through our two operating subsidiaries, Fidelity Life, an Illinois-domiciled life insurance company, and Efinancial, a call center-based insurance agency. Efinancial sells Fidelity Life products through its own call center distribution platform, independent agents and other marketing organizations. Efinancial, in addition to offering Fidelity Life products, sells insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. We report our operating results in three segments: Agency, Insurance and Corporate.\nOur primary revenue sources are life insurance premiums, commissions, net investment income, net realized investment gains (losses), insurance lead sales and other income.\n \u2022 Asset concentration guidelines that limit the amount that we hold in any one issuer of securities, \nCredit risk is the risk of loss due to an adverse change in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer or, in the case of a securitized investment, adverse change in the assets being securitized. We address credit risk by establishing minimum rating standards for investments that our portfolio managers can acquire and, in the case of a downgrade, continue to hold the investment. For our core fixed maturity portfolio, which comprises a significant majority of our invested assets, only investment grade securities (minimum credit rating for new investments is BBB- as established by Standard & Poor's or a comparable nationally recognized statistical rating organization) can be purchased and such portfolio managers must maintain an overall credit rating for the portfolio of at least A-. Through our portfolio managers, we monitor the financial condition of all the issues of securities that we own. As an additional step to reduce our exposure to credit risk, we have established diversification guidelines limiting the total amount of holding by issuer and by investment sector.\nExpense-our Insurance Segment recognizes the first-year commission as a policy acquisition cost, in proportion to the premiums earned from providing insurance coverage throughout the first year that the policy is in force. In addition, our Insurance Segment defers the amount by which the first-year commission acquisition costs exceed the ultimate renewal commission and records this amount as deferred acquisition cost that is amortized over the expected life of the policy.\nwhich temporary differences are deductible or creditable. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recognized deferred tax asset value may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.\nCash uses in our Insurance Segment result in negative operating cash flows related to sales of new insurance policies because:\nFor the Open Block sensitivity testing, DAC is still recoverable under the lapse sensitivity test. However, under the mortality and investment earned rates sensitivity tests, the DAC would have to be decreased by $5.9 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nOur critical accounting policies are described in Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was a valuation allowance of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nIntercompany Eliminations\nOverview\nUnder applicable Federal income tax guidance, the taxation of life insurance companies is subject to special rules not applicable to other (non-life) companies. Accordingly, we have to consider the implications of these different tax rules in accounting for income tax expense, as separately applicable to our life and non-life subgroups of companies.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, insurance lead sales were $5.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.3 million was primarily due to lower click and transfer revenue.\nLevel 3 fair value classification consists of investments in structured securities where the fair value of the security is determined by a pricing service using internal pricing models where one or more of the significant inputs is unobservable in the marketplace, or there is a single broker/dealer quote. The fair value of a broker-quoted asset is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. The Company does not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset.\n \u2022 financial market conditions, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates and the level and trends of stock market prices causing a reduction of net investment income or realized losses and reduction in the value of our investment portfolios; \nOperating Costs and Expenses\nBenefits and Expenses\nWe establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to realize the value of the deferred tax asset. We evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis. Negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years. Positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income and tax-planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe record federal income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on pre-tax income as determined using GAAP accounting. The timing of the recognition of certain income and expense items for GAAP accounting can differ from the timing of recognition of the same income and expense items in our federal tax returns. The timing of recognition in the federal tax return is based on tax laws and regulations. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is different than that reported in the tax returns.\n\nThe results of the Corporate Segment are as follows:\nNet Insurance Premiums\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consists of the assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. The annuity liabilities are reducing each period due to cash withdrawals by contract-holders on this block of annuities that were primarily written in the late 1980s. Cash deposits to these annuity contracts are minimal compared to cash withdrawal activity. Also included in financing cash flows are net proceeds from our commission financing program.\n\nThis segment consists of the operations of Fidelity Life. Fidelity Life underwrites primarily term life insurance through Efinancial and a diverse group of independent insurance distributors. Fidelity Life specializes in life insurance products that can be issued immediately or within a short period following a sales call, using non-medical underwriting at the time of policy issuance.\nWe invest our available cash and funds that support our regulatory capital, surplus requirements and policy reserves in investment securities that are included in our Insurance and Corporate Segments. We earn income on these investments in the form of interest on fixed maturity securities (bonds and mortgage loans) and dividends (from equity holdings). Net investment income is recorded net of investment related expenses as revenue. The amount of net investment income that we recognize will vary depending on the amount of invested assets that we own, the types of investments we own, the interest rates earned and amount of dividends received on our investments.\nAgency Segment expenses consist of marketing costs to acquire potential customers, salary and bonuses paid to our employee agents, salary and other costs of employees involved in managing the underwriting process for our insurance applications, sales management, agent licensing, training and compliance costs. Other Agency Segment expenses include costs associated with financial and administrative employees, facilities rent, and information technology. After payroll, the most significant Agency Segment expense is the cost of acquiring leads. We are able to partially offset our sales leads expense through advertising revenues from individuals who click on specific advertisements while viewing one of our web pages, and through the resale of leads that are not well suited for our call center. For years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, these offsetting revenues were $5.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, which reduced our total agency expenses by approximately 10% and 11%, respectively. Our Agency Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that commissions and other revenue exceed (are less than) our marketing and overhead costs for the period.\nUnder an agreement with Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective Life), the successor to a former affiliate of Fidelity Life, Fidelity Life had assumed a portion of risk on a group of life insurance contracts primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s. On March 29, 2019, Protective Life and Fidelity Life agreed that Protective Life would recapture the majority of this assumed life block of business, thereby relieving Fidelity Life from further liability under the recaptured business (except for obligations incurred prior to the recapture effective date). Under the recapture agreement, Fidelity Life paid Protective Life an amount equal to the assumed carried reserves, and in turn, Fidelity Life will receive payment from its reinsurers of this business for their portion of the related ceded reserves. We recognized a $2.2 million gain from this transaction in 2019.\nWe performed the following sensitivity tests as of September 30, 2020:\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOne key measure of our net investment income is the book yield on our holdings of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, which holdings totaled $363.9 million and $314.9 million, and represented 85.7% and 77.2% of our invested assets, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Book yield is the effective interest rate, before investment expenses, that we earn on these investments. Book yield is calculated as the percent of net investment income to the average amortized cost of the underlying investments for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our book yield on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale was 3.9% and 4.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCorporate Segment\nThe block where there are no dividends expected had a significant number of policies issued in December 1999 which had level premiums for the first 20 durations, followed by premiums which increased significantly in duration 21 as the premiums from that point forward go to an annually increasing scale. The approximate increase in premiums going from the 20th to the 21st duration is 1300%. Direct policies are a mixture of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly premium payment modes, whereas ceded policies are all annual premium mode. Therefore, both direct and ceded premiums increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2019 on the Closed Block compared to the prior year as this group of policies ended their level term with larger impacts affecting ceded premiums more than direct premiums as a result of these modal differences.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nWe have experienced net negative cash flows in 2020 and in most prior periods due to continued growth in sales of our life insurance products and in our Agency operations and through continued net withdrawals on assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. Our annuity deposits are in run-off because we do not market annuity contracts to generate annuity deposits to offset the withdrawal activity on in-force contracts.\nOur Corporate Segment experienced negative cash flows as a result of the payment of allocated overhead expenses.\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses\n\nThis category consists of benefits to policyholders, which include policyholder dividends and policyholder dividend obligations (PDO), interest credited to policyholder and contract-holder balances, general operating expenses and amortization of DAC.\nThe following analysis reconciles the reported segment results to the Vericity, Inc. total consolidated results. The main difference is the intercompany eliminations.\nGains and losses on sales of investments are classified as net realized investment gains (losses) and are recorded as revenue. Capital appreciation and depreciation caused by changes in the market value of investments classified as available-for-sale\u201d is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of investment gains and losses that we recognize depends on the amount of and the types of invested assets we own and the market conditions related to those investments. Our cash needs can vary from time to time and could require that we sell invested assets to fund cash needs.", "item_7_text": "Analysis of Segment Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, earned commissions were $43.4 million compared to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $4.0 million resulted from increased sales in the retail channel, which was primarily driven by increased agent headcount, partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale channel.\nNet investment income consists of income generated from our investment portfolio and is recorded net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income primarily consists of interest income earned on fixed maturity security investments and dividends earned on our equity holdings, net of related expenses incurred to manage our investments. Net investment income earned on assets required to support insurance reserves, annuity deposits and related regulatory capital requirements is allocated to our Insurance Segment. Any other net investment income is recorded in the Corporate Segment.\nEfinancial agents produced 88.6% and 86.8% of the direct policies written by Fidelity Life for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We plan to increase the number of policies sold through Efinancial as we pursue our strategic plan to further develop our controlled distribution platform and grow our book of business. However, sales of insurance policies through Efinancial immediately result in significantly higher consolidated expense recognition and lower consolidated net income in comparison to Fidelity Life policies distributed through an unaffiliated entity. GAAP requires that we immediately expense that portion of our policy acquisition costs for policies placed through Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the placement of a policy. As a result of this immediate expense recognition of the majority of policy acquisition costs of our sales through Efinancial, we incur a net loss in the first year on each policy sold through Efinancial. To the extent we are successful in increasing our premium writings through Efinancial over each of the next several years or more, we expect that the impact of recognizing a majority of Efinancial commissions as a current expense will, among other factors, continue to adversely affect our results of operations and contribute to our continuing to incur consolidated net losses and a reduction to our consolidated equity in each such year as we seek to implement our distribution strategy. Over the long term and assuming that our products perform consistent with our assumptions, once we have developed a sustainable book of business and our expected growth through Efinancial has leveled, we expect that revenues from policy renewals may begin to offset the immediate expense recognition resulting from writing new policies through Efinancial. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\u201d and Results of Operations-Analysis of Segment Results-Corporate Segment-Intercompany Eliminations.\u201d\n \u2022 future lapse assumptions increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.05, \nUsing Efinancial, our controlled distribution platform, we have full vertical integration for the sale and issuance of life insurance policies and are able to gather end-to-end consumer data, extending from tracking data to analyzing the characteristics of leads that generate successful marketing efforts to the associated underwriting and claims experience. Since we acquired Efinancial in 2009, we have made significant investments in the development of our controlled distribution strategy for reaching our target market. By converting data we generate through our distribution platform into actionable insight using statistical analysis, we will seek to be more efficient in our acquisition and use of leads, improve our call center placement ratios and strive to achieve overall profitability. However, the investments made in pursuit of this strategy, among other factors, have adversely affected our historical results of operations.\nThe impact of the eliminations for intercompany transactions primarily consists of the sales by our Agency Segment of life products of our Insurance Segment. The eliminations represent the amounts required to eliminate the intercompany transactions as recorded in our segment results, and in particular, to eliminate any intersegment profits resulting from such transactions. Our segment results follow the accounting principles and methods applicable to each segment as if the intercompany transactions were with unaffiliated organizations:\nOur mortgage loans are held on commercial real estate and are stated at the aggregate unpaid principal balances, net of any write-downs and valuation allowances. We identify loans for evaluation of impairment primarily based on the collection experience of each loan. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect principal or interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral. Impairments are included in net realized investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSecurities that are classified as available-for-sale are subject to market declines below amortized cost (a gross unrealized loss position). When a gross unrealized loss position occurs, the security is considered impaired. Quarterly or when necessary, we review each impaired security to identify whether the impairment may be other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) and require the recognition of an impairment loss in the current period earnings. Indication of OTTI includes potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or other company or industry specific concerns. A number of factors are considered in determining whether or not a decline in a specific security is other-than-temporary, including our current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. An impairment loss will be recorded if our intention is to sell an impaired security or it is considered to be more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and equity securities by fair value hierarchy was as follows:\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, Fidelity Life changed the commission structure related to Efinancial's sale of the RAPIDecision\u00ae Life to pay annual level commissions over the life of the product instead of heaped, or first-year-only commissions. This change reduced Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business by spreading its statutory commission expenses over the life of the policy instead of incurring it all in the policy year of issue. In order to help provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions, Fidelity Life and Efinancial entered into a financing arrangement with Hannover Life under which, on a monthly basis, Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to the first-year-only commissions on Fidelity Life RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business sold through Efinancial. In exchange, Efinancial assigns to Hannover Life its right to all future levelized commission payments on that business due from Fidelity Life, and Fidelity Life pays to Hannover Life the level commissions over the life of the contract. Our arrangement with Hannover Life allows us to finance up to $30.0 million of commission expense. Efinancial's ability to receive advances under this arrangement will terminate when the aggregate amount advanced under the arrangement equals or exceeds $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nResults of Operations\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities\nCorporate Segment\nSee Note 2-Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, general operating expenses were $31.6 million compared to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to a reduction in reinsurance allowances of $3.3 million, which includes $6.8 million related to the Closed Block, partially offset by increased allowances of $3.6 million in the Core Life and\nCOVID-19\nIn order for our insurance operations to be profitable, we must achieve product experience consistent with our pricing assumptions. We price our products using a number of assumptions that are designed to support the desired level of profitability. Our operating results will be affected by variances between our pricing assumptions and our actual experience. The key pricing assumptions made are:\nEquity market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Adverse changes in equity prices can arise from both the movements of broad markets based on investor behavior or other general economic factors and also from adverse changes in an individual company's stock price. We manage our equity market risk primarily by limiting our exposure to individual issuers and by maintaining liquid holdings such that we are able to find a ready market should we want to lower our exposure to equity markets. Our individual stock holdings are managed by a specialty manager with portfolio guidelines that include limits on industry exposures and the size of investments in individual issuers. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $3.8 million and $5.2 million of exposure to equity market risk in our Insurance Segment through holdings of individual equity securities, respectively.\nWe review the interest rate sensitivity of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by calculating the impact on the market value of our holdings that would result from a hypothetical instantaneous shift in market interest rates across all maturities, which we consider to be reasonably possible. The impact of such a parallel shift upward in the yield curve of 200 basis points would reduce the market value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by $52.0 million (14.3%) and $41.3 million (13.1%) as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated market value changes assume all other factors are held constant and do not attempt to estimate any offsetting change in the value of our liabilities.\nIncluded in Closed Block assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are $10.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of additional Closed Block funding, plus accrued interest, that is eligible for reversion to the Company if not needed to fund Closed Block experience.\nInsurance Segment expenses consist of benefits paid to policyholders or their beneficiaries under life insurance policies. Benefit expenses also include additions to the reserve for future policyholder benefits to recognize our estimated future obligations under the policies. Benefit expenses are shown net of amounts ceded under our reinsurance contracts. Our Insurance Segment also incurs policy acquisition costs that consist of commissions paid to agents, policy underwriting and issue costs and variable sales costs. A portion of these policy acquisition costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the insurance policies acquired during the period. In addition to policy acquisition costs, we incur expenses that vary based on the number of contracts that we have in-force, or variable policy administrative costs. These variable costs consist of expenses paid to third-party administrators based on rates for each policy administered. As the number of in-force policies increases, these expenses will increase. Conversely, when the number of in-force policies declines, variable policy expenses decline. Our insurance operations also incur overhead costs for functional and administrative staff to support insurance operations, financial reporting and information technology. We recognize income (loss) on insurance operations to the extent that premium revenues, net investment income and realized gains (losses) exceed (are less than) benefit expenses and general operating expenses for the period.\n \u2022 our ability to grow and develop our insurance business and successfully develop and market new products; \nWe also record capital appreciation/depreciation on our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had a change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from mark-to-market adjustments of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities totaling $7.8 million and $11.1 million (net of federal income taxes and reserve), respectively.\n \u2022 our ability to grow and develop our Agency business through expansion of retail call centers, online sales, wholesale operations and other areas of opportunity; \nA premium deficiency exists if the discounted present value of future gross premiums is not sufficient to cover anticipated future cash outflows. To assess the adequacy of our benefit reserves, we annually perform premium deficiency testing for each of our\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices on the fair value of the investment securities that we own. We have exposure to market risk through our investment activities, including interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk and foreign currency risk. We have not and do not plan to enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Closed Block was formed as of October 1, 2006 and contains all participating policies issued or assumed by Fidelity Life. The assets and future net cash flows of the Closed Block are available only for purposes of paying benefits, expenses and dividends of the Closed Block and are not available to the Company, except for an amount of additional funding that was established at inception. The additional funding was designed to protect the block against future adverse experience, and if the funding is not required for that purpose, it is subject to reversion to the Company in the future. Any reversion of Closed Block assets to the Company must be approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance.\n \u2022 Asset quality guidelines applied on a portfolio basis and for individual issues that establish a minimum asset quality standard for portfolios and establish minimum asset quality standards for investment purchases and investment holdings, \nCash flows from investing activities includes our fixed maturity securities and equity holdings that are classified as available-for-sale securities. Period to period, the cash flows associated with the changes in these portfolios will vary between cash sources and cash uses depending on portfolio trading due to investment market conditions and other factors.\nInvestment Returns\n \u2022 Operating Expenses. Our level of operating expenses affects our reported net income (loss). Our general operating expenses include expenses that vary based on the growth in our revenues and expenses that are fixed regardless of revenue growth. As discussed above, we have experienced operating losses principally because our operating expenses and corporate overhead exceed our revenues, and our inability to defer a majority of our commission expense on policies produced by our affiliated agency, Efinancial. \nEfinancial Commission Financing\n \u2022 Investment Returns. We earn income on the investments held to support reserves and capital requirements. The amount of net investment income that we recognize will vary depending on the amount of invested assets that we own, the types of investments we own, the interest rates earned and amount of dividends received on our investments. If the actual amount of net investment income earned is less than projected, our products may not generate the desired level of profitability. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, general operating expenses were $49.2 million compared to $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $3.5 million was primarily due to lower marketing costs and the 2019 expense of $0.9 million from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, intercompany eliminations resulted in a $7.3 million reduction in pre-tax income compared to a $4.0 million reduction in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $3.3 million was mainly due to lower expense credit for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nNon\u00adCore Life - Our Non\u00adCore Life business consists of: products that are currently being marketed but are not deemed to be of high strategic importance to the Company\u037e in\u00adforce policies from product lines introduced since Fidelity Life resumed independent operations in 2005, but were subsequently discontinued\u037e and an older annuity block of business that was not included in the Closed Block.\n \u2022 Persistency Experience. Many of the non-medically underwritten products that we issue have a limited amount of insurance industry information to use in developing policy lapse rates. We are developing our own historical experience as to expected lapse rates for these products and reflect our emerging experience in our pricing. If actual policy lapse rates exceed the lapse rates assumed in pricing our products, we may receive lower premium revenues and may not receive enough premium to cover all of our acquisition costs for the policy. \nBenefit expenses are recorded in our Insurance Segment. Benefit expenses include claims paid or payable on in-force insurance policies, as well as the change in our reserves for future policy benefits during the period. Benefit expenses are reduced by amounts ceded to reinsurance companies with whom we contract to share policy risks.\nLevel 1 securities include principally exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices for identical assets.\nNet realized investment gains (losses) are subject to general economic trends and in particular correlate generally with movements in the major equity market indexes. The amounts classified as realized gains and losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations include amounts realized from sales of investments, mark-to-market adjustments on investments classified as equity holdings and investments that use the equity method of accounting (limited partnership interests which are included in Other invested assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities related to credit impairments.\nThe resulting negative first year cash flows from sales of new policies are partially offset by positive cash flows from insurance policy renewals. The continued sales growth in our Insurance operations has resulted in a net cash decrease from operations. Cash flows from reinsurance collections will vary from period to period based on claims activity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe credit loss component of fixed maturity securities impairment is calculated as the difference between amortized cost of the security and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of cash flows discounted at the effective rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or prior impairment. The methodology and assumptions for estimating the cash flows vary depending on the type of security. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates, including prepayment assumptions, are based on data from widely accepted third-party sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss exists, and the security is considered to be temporarily impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, the security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The portion of the OTTI that is not considered a credit loss, is recognized as OTTI in accumulated comprehensive income.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nViewed at the segment level, because of the timing difference between the Agency Segment's immediate recognition of commission revenue and the Insurance Segment's deferral and amortization of the commission expense over the expected life of the policy, all else being equal, the sale of a policy through our Agency Segment results in an intersegment profit in an amount equal to the difference between the commission paid and the related amortization expense. However, in consolidation, two impacts occur. First, the intercompany revenue recognized by our Agency Segment and the related deferred acquisition expense recorded by our Insurance Segment are eliminated. Second, we record deferred acquisition costs equal to that portion of Commission DAC that can be tied directly to Efinancial's expenses incurred in the successful placement of a policy. Therefore, in consolidation, the Commission DAC recorded in our Insurance Segment is effectively reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from Efinancial expenses that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC, which represents a majority of the Commission DAC, is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral under GAAP. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\u201d and Factors Affecting our Results-Strategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\u201d for more information. The results of these elimination entries were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe forward-looking statements include, among other things, those items listed below:\nIn response to the economic impact related to COVID-19, concessions were granted to certain of the Company's mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications. At June 30, 2020, the Company held 25 mortgage loans where requests for temporary modifications were granted (23 were modified to interest only and 2 to forbearance). The total loan balance for these 25 loans amounted to $4.4 million or about 9% of the mortgage loan portfolio. At June 30, 2020, 17 of the 25 temporary loan modifications had returned to full payment (both principal and interest) under the modified loan terms, including the 2 loans given forbearance. Of the remaining 8 loans that were granted loan modifications, 7 of these loans returned to full payment status as of September 30. 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company granted a loan modification through December 31, 2020 on a loan that was outside of the original 25 loan modifications previously granted. The combined loan balance of the 2 loans under temporary modification status at December 31, 2020 amounted to $0.5 million, or less than 1% of the mortgage loan portfolio.\nOur Insurance Segment realizes operating profit from the excess of our book yield realized on fixed maturity securities that support our contract-holder deposits over the amount of interest that we credit to the contract-holder. We refer to this operating profit as the spread\u201d we earn on contract-holder deposits. Our book yields on fixed maturity investments have declined in recent periods due to current market conditions. If book yields continue to decline, the amount of spread between the interest earned and credited will be reduced.\n\nRevenues\nTotal Revenues\nThe Closed Block was funded based on a model developed to forecast the future cash flows of the Closed Block which is referred to as the glide path.\u201d The glide path model projected the anticipated future cash flows of the Closed Block as established at the initial funding. We compare the actual results of the Closed Block to expected results from the glide path as part of the annual assessment of the current level of policyholder dividends. The assessment of policyholder dividends includes projections of future experience of the Closed Block policies and the investment experience of the Closed Block assets. The review of Closed Block experience also includes consideration of whether a policy dividend obligation should be recorded to reflect favorable Closed Block experience that has not yet been reflected in the dividend scales. See Note 5-Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 the effect of legislative, judicial, economic, demographic and regulatory events in the jurisdictions where we do business; \nMost of these policies lapsed in the first quarter of 2020. This caused a reversal of ceded premiums and a reduction in the direct due and unpaid premiums on the policies which lapsed. The lapsed policies also caused reversals of items such as ceding allowances, reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe results of our Agency Segment were as follows:\nEquity Market Risk\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a 100% valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets related to the non-life subgroup of our tax return because we determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recoverable. The recording of the valuation allowance increases our federal income tax expense which in turn reduces our reported net income or increases our net loss as applicable. Our recorded net deferred tax asset is shown in the following table. The balances for each period are shown based on the life/non-life portions of the consolidated federal tax returns and in total.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking\u201d statements that are intended to enhance the reader's ability to assess our future financial and business performance. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that represent our beliefs concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments, and contain words and phrases such as may,\u201d expects,\u201d should,\u201d believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d intends\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, statements that refer to our future financial performance, anticipated growth and trends in our business and in our industry and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nCash Flows\n \u2022 increased competition in our businesses, including the potential impacts of aggressive price competition by other insurance companies, payment of higher commissions to agents that could affect demand for our insurance products and impact the ability to grow and retain agents in our Agency Segment and the entry of new competitors and the development of new products by new or existing competitors, resulting in a reduction in the demand for our products and services; \nThe stress and disruption placed on the global economy and financial markets from the outbreak of COVID-19 may continue to have near and long-term negative effects on investment valuations, returns, and credit allowance exposure. The Company will continue to closely monitor the situation, including potential negative impacts on sales of new policies and mortality; however, due to the highly uncertain nature of these conditions, it is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of COVID-19 or its impact to the Company's operations, but the effect could be material.\nNational Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC\nUnder best estimate assumptions as to mortality, lapses, expenses, and investment yields, DAC is still recoverable on the Core Life and Non-Core Life products (Open Block), Closed Block, and assumed life line of business. The annuities line has no remaining DAC, and under best estimate assumptions on that line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\n \u2022 Amounts due from reinsurers to reimburse claims paid are usually paid at some date after the claim has been paid. \nSee Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWith regard to our assumed annuity deposits, we are subject to risk from contract-holder behavior resulting from changes in interest rates. The assumed annuity contracts have virtually no surrender charges remaining that could be assessed against withdrawals. When market interest rates exceed the amount that we are crediting on deposits, we are subject to higher contract-holder withdrawals or an increase in contract loans, both of which could force the Company to sell assets prematurely and could lead to the realization of capital losses on such sales. As of December 31, 2020, we were crediting interest at the minimum contract interest rate, which on a composite basis is approximately 3.9% annually. We manage our exposure to rising interest rates through our ability to increase the contract crediting rate. Our ability to increase our crediting rate is constrained by our portfolio yield at the time of the decision to increase rates. Increases in the contract crediting rates could reduce our income unless we are able to maintain a constant interest spread on our assets.\nLoss from Operations Before Income Taxes\n\nNet realized investment gains (losses) result from sales of investment securities and OTTI for estimated credit losses of fixed maturity securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total liabilities of $573.5 million compared to total liabilities of $509.4 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.1 million. Future policy benefits and claims increased $45.8 million, primarily due to a $44.9 million increase in Core and Non-Core lines due to growth and maturity of the underlying blocks of business, and a $2.4 million increase in annuities and assumed life, primarily related to the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in the Closed Block. Other policyholder liabilities increased $12.7 million, primarily due to $11.2 million in Core and Non-Core lines and $1.7 million in Closed Block. Debt increased $9.9 million related to additional net borrowings under our commission financing agreement with Hannover Life. Other liabilities increased $6.3 million, primarily related to changes in operating accruals and chargeback allowances. Policyholder dividend obligations related to the Closed Block increased $1.8 million, primarily related to changes in the market value of invested assets. Reinsurance liabilities and payables decreased $8.7 million, primarily due to timing of reinsurance settlements and $3.6 million decrease in Policyholder account balances, largely due to annuity payments.\nRecapture of Assumed Life Business\nDAC amortization represents the actuarially determined reduction in the DAC asset for the period. The amount of acquisition cost amortization recognized each period is based on actual factors established when the insurance contracts were written.\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nClosed Block - Our Closed Block represents all in\u00adforce participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. The Closed Block was established in connection with our 2007 reorganization into a mutual holding company structure and represents all in-force participating insurance policies of Fidelity Life. Annuities and assumed life represent (i) our assumed life business, which consists of policies primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s; (ii) our direct annuity contracts, which consist of approximately 77 structured settlement contracts that remain from a group of contracts entered into in the late 1980s; and (iii) our assumed annuities, which consist of contract-holder deposits assumed from a former affiliate under two coinsurance treaties entered into in 1991 and 1992. The 2019 demutualization of Members Mutual Holding Company had no impact on how the Closed Block is structured.\nSee Note 2-Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe liability for deferred annuity deposits represents the contract-holder account balances. Due to the declines in market interest rates and the book yield on our investment portfolio, we credit interest on all contract-holder deposit liabilities at contractual rates that are currently at the minimum rate allowed by the contract or by state regulations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total benefits and expenses were $175.1 million compared to $155.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $19.6 million was primarily due to higher life, annuity, and health claim benefits.\n \u2022 Depending on the product sold, a portion or all of the agent's commission may be paid as a cash advance to the agent and most of the underwriting and policy issue costs are paid at the time the initial policy is issued, whereas the premiums may be paid throughout the policy year, and \n\nOperating expenses are incurred by all of our segments. The operating expenses of our Insurance Segment include policy acquisition costs in excess of amounts that qualify for deferral, ceding commissions received on ceded reinsurance in excess of amounts deferred, variable policy administration costs, general overhead and administration costs, and insurance premium taxes and assessments paid to various states. Agency Segment expenses consist of compensation paid to employee sales agents, costs of insurance sales leads (marketing), costs of sales management and support activities, agent licensing expenses and general overhead and administration expenses. The expenses of the Corporate Segment include allocation of a portion of the compensation of senior executives related to corporate activities, Board of Director expenses related to corporate business, and other operating costs considered to be of a corporate nature and not directly related to either of our other business segments. Overhead and administrative expenses of the segments include employee costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits), office rent, information technology and costs of third-party administrators and other contractors.\nConsequently, such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as our current plans, estimates and beliefs with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. Except as required under the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and do not undertake, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances after the date of such statements.\nPrincipal Revenue & Expense Items\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenues were $147.8 million compared to $135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $12.5 million primarily resulted from higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions, partially offset by decreases in net investment income, realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales.\nOther Income\nThe net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.8 million to $10.8 million from a net loss of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to higher operating costs and expenses due to targeted growth initiatives and costs associated with being a public company and partially offset by $3.2 million of costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019.\n\nIncome Taxes\nEvery quarter, we review all investments where the market value is less than the carrying value to ascertain if the impairment of the security's value is OTTI. The quarterly review is targeted to focus on securities with larger impairments and that have been in an impaired status for longer periods of time. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Polices-Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\u201d.\nNet Loss\nInterest rate risk arises from the price sensitivity of investments to changes in interest rates. The changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates. As market interest rates fall the fixed income streams of fixed maturity investments held become more valuable and market values rise. As market interest rates rise, the opposite effect occurs. Interest rate risk can also arise if market rates fall, which can result in lower interest spreads on our assumed annuity deposits, which are our primary interest rate sensitive liability.\n \u2022 Diversification guidelines that limit the exposure at any time to the total portfolio by investment sectors. \nAgency Segment\nUnrealized Holding Gains (Losses)\nNon-Core Life lines. In addition, there was $1.0 million increase in depreciation costs and $1.1 million in staff costs. The increases were partially offset by $1.8 million costs from the accelerated vesting of incentive compensation related to the completion of the IPO in 2019. See Closed Block\u201d section in this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding Closed Block and Note 8- Closed Block\u201d in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an estimated $4.3 million in net incurred policyholder claims that included COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death.\n \u2022 the inability to manage future growth and integration of our operations; and \n\n \u2022 future mortality increased by a multiplicative factor of 1.05 for all life blocks, \nFidelity Life is also subject to the model regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies\u201d commonly known as Regulation XXX.\u201d This regulation requires life insurance companies that issue insurance policies with level premium guarantees to carry reserves that can greatly exceed the amount that the insurance company believes is necessary to reflect its liability for future claims payments. Such reserves are sometimes referred to as non-economic reserves.\u201d Many insurance companies use reinsurance, financing, formation of captive reinsurers and other reserve financing transactions to reduce the regulatory capital needs under Regulation XXX. Generally, these solutions have only been available to carriers with much larger amounts of affected liabilities than Fidelity Life. To mitigate the future impact on regulatory capital from Regulation XXX and help stabilize our regulatory capital position in light of anticipated sales increases, we entered into a reserve financing agreement with Hannover Life effective July 1, 2013 that covered certain products with policies written on or before September 30, 2012. This agreement was first amended and restated as of July 1, 2016 and a subsequent amendment was filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance in November 2019 and approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance on December 23, 2019. The structure of the agreement, which was first effective July 1, 2013, involves a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and yearly renewable term reinsurance covering most of the Company's non-participating in-force life insurance business with issue dates on or before December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the reserve credit under this arrangement was approximately $181.4 million.\nIf we believe the pricing information received from third-party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs observable in the market, we may challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service. Historically, we have not challenged or updated the prices provided by third-party pricing services. However, any such updates by a pricing service to be more consistent with the presented market observations, or any adjustments made by us to prices provided by third-party pricing services, would be reflected in the balance sheet for the current period.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nOur principal sources of funds are from premium revenues, commission revenues, net investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments. The Company's primary uses of funds are for payment of life policy benefits, contract-holder withdrawals on assumed annuity contracts, new business acquisition costs for our insurance operations (i.e., commissions, underwriting and issue costs), cost of sales for Agency operations (i.e., agent compensation, purchased lead and lead generation costs), general operating expenses and purchases of investments. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide funds periodically over time, through net investment income and maturities, to provide for the payment of policy benefits and contract-holder withdrawals.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future claims payments to policyholders using actuarial assumptions in accordance with industry practice and GAAP. Many factors affect these reserves, including mortality trends, policy persistency and investment returns. We establish our reserves based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience.\nThe primary reserve method that is used in calculation of our future policy benefit reserves is the net level premium method. The net level premium method requires that the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use a number of actuarial assumptions that represent management's best estimate at the time the contract was issued with the addition of a margin for adverse deviation. Actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, mortality, policy persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a loss before taxes of $27.3 million compared to a loss before taxes of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increased loss of $7.1 million was primarily due to increases in life, annuity, and health claim benefits and decreases in net investment income, net realized investment (losses) gains and insurance lead sales, partially offset by higher net insurance premiums and earned commissions.\nLevel 1-Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets the Company can access.\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\nOur investment portfolios are all managed by third-party investment managers that specialize in insurance company asset management and in particular these managers are selected based upon their expertise in the particular asset classes that we own. We contract with an investment management firm to provide overall assistance with oversight of our portfolio managers, evaluation of investment performance and assistance with development and implementation of our investment strategy. This investment management firm reports to our Chief Financial Officer and to the Investment Committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if circumstances require, we review the performance of all portfolios and portfolio managers with the Investment Committee.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred taxes for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. Under GAAP, we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. To the extent that we are required to establish an additional valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, the amount of such valuation allowance would generally be charged against our net income for the period in which that valuation allowance is established.\nassumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience, market indicators and other relevant factors and circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may affect our financial position and results of operations.\n \u2022 future investment yield assumptions were lowered by 50 basis points. \nInsurance Segment\nIn connection with our premium deficiency testing, we performed sensitivity analyses on our Open Block, Closed Block, annuities, and assumed life business lines to capture the effect that certain key assumptions have on expected future cash flows, and the impact of those assumptions on the adequacy of DAC balances and GAAP benefit reserves. The sensitivity tests are performed independently, without consideration for any correlation among the key assumptions.\nFidelity Life is subject to regulatory guidelines related to the ratio of its capital level compared to its RBC level as determined by formulas adopted by state insurance departments and applicable to all life insurance companies. A company's authorized control level RBC\u201d is a measure of the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size, growth and risk profile. RBC standards are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions for insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions. Companies that do not maintain total adjusted RBC in excess of 200% of the company's authorized control level RBC may be required to take specific actions at the direction of state insurance regulators. Fidelity Life's total adjusted capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was well in excess of 200% of its authorized control level. See Business-Regulation-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\nInterest Credited to Policyholder Account Balances\n \u2022 Mortality Experience. We use our historical experience combined with experience projections from our reinsurance partners to develop our assumptions for the level, frequency and pattern of future claims experience. In our Insurance Segment, we principally issue non-medically underwritten products through underwriting processes that generally have limited recent company and industry experience; therefore, their performance may be less reliable and subject to greater variance than products underwritten through processes with more established industry experience. \nThe Agency Segment's main source of revenue is commissions earned on the sale of insurance policies sold through our retail channel. Efinancial's employee agents utilize insurance sales leads to contact or be contacted by potential customers and then work with the customers to complete the sales process, which can occur during the initial contact or within 24 to 48 hours for non-medically underwritten policies. In our wholesale channel, we subcontract with our independent agents who sell through Efinancial's contracts with its unaffiliated insurance carriers. In consideration for using our carrier contracts and services, we receive a portion of the commission earned by the independent agent from the carrier.\nFinancial Position\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $768.8 million compared to total assets at December 31, 2019 of $721.8 million, an increase of $47.0 million. The invested asset base increased $16.9 million, primarily due to an increase in fixed maturity securities of $48.9 million, which includes $15.1 million of market value changes, offset by maturity of short-term investments of $29.8 million. Reinsurance recoverables increased $25.1 million as a result of a $22.4 million increase in ceded policy and claim reserves and an increase of $2.7 million related to timing of settlements of reinsured claims. Commission and agent balances increased $8.3 million due to the timing of collections. Deferred policy acquisition costs increased $1.4 million, primarily due to deferrals on new business in excess of amortization. Deferred income taxes increased $1.5 million, primarily due to a deferred tax credit as a result of net loss, partially offset by tax on unrealized investment market gains. Cash decreased $1.6 million, primarily related to cash used from investments, partially offset by cash from operating and financing activities. Other assets decreased $4.5 million, primarily due to decreases in due premium mostly on the Closed Block, partially offset by increases in internally developed software.\nNet (Loss) Income\nStrategic Goals and Financial Impact of Sales of Policies Produced by Efinancial\n \u2022 costs, availability and collectability of reinsurance; \nAccuracy of Our Pricing Assumptions\nReconciliation of Segment Results to Consolidated Results\nNet Investment Income\nThe Company continues to monitor the effects of the changing economic environment on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and currently have a number of securities on our watch list, which are mainly concentrated in the oil and gas and airline sectors. Our assessment through December 31, 2020 has resulted in no additional material other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI) due to COVID-19 and the recent market events.\nRegarding this sensitivity testing for the annuities line, there is no remaining DAC due to the age of the contracts. As such, these sensitivity runs tested the adequacy of the benefit reserves for this line. For the annuities line, a drop in investment yield of 50 basis points would result in a required reserve increase of $0.7 million, while for the mortality scenario and the lapse scenario there would be no impact to benefit reserves.\nInsurance Segment\nLife, Annuity and Health Claim Benefits\n \u2022 changes in industry trends and financial strength ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. \nWe provide life insurance protection targeted to the middle American market. We believe there is a substantial unmet need for life insurance, particularly among domestic households with annual incomes of between $50,000 and $125,000, a market we refer to as our target Middle Market. We differentiate our product and service offerings through innovative product design and sales processes, with an emphasis on rapidly issued products that are not medically underwritten at the time of sale.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nInvestment Guidelines\nThe following table shows the distribution of the fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale by quality rating, using the rating assigned by Standard & Poor's (S&P), a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. For securities where the S&P rating is not available (not rated), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) rating is used. Over the periods presented, we have maintained a consistent weighted average bond quality rating of A.\u201d The percentage allocation of total investment grade securities has decreased to 97.9% at December 31, 2020 from 98.2% at December 31, 2019 due to the S&P ratings on certain new securities acquired in our portfolio of distressed residential mortgage-backed securities.\nAnnuities and Assumed Life - We have assumed reinsurance commitments with respect to annuity contract-holder deposits and a block of life insurance contracts that were ceded by former affiliates of Fidelity Life. On March 29, 2019, one of these former affiliates recaptured the majority of the assumed block of life business. The annuity deposits were ceded to Fidelity Life through two contracts entered into in the early 1990s. These annuity and assumed life deposits are now largely in run\u00adoff, with only minor amounts of new deposits each year. There are minimal remaining surrender charges associated with the assumed annuity contracts.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our DAC asset as part of our premium deficiency testing. If a premium deficiency exists, we reduce DAC by the amount of the deficiency through a charge to current period earnings (loss). If the deficiency is more than the recognized DAC balance, we reduce the DAC balance to zero and increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess with a corresponding charge to current period earnings (loss). See Future Policy Benefit Reserves\u201d below for more information on premium deficiency testing.\nThere was OTTI on fixed maturity securities in the amount of $68 thousand and $41 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\nCredit Risk\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFor our Insurance Segment, other income primarily consists of cost of insurance charges on universal life contracts.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest credited was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $0.1 million was due to lower interest credited on assumed fixed annuity contract-holder account balances.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nThis segment primarily consists of the operations of Efinancial. Efinancial is a call center-based insurance agency that markets life insurance for Fidelity Life and unaffiliated insurance companies. Efinancial's primary operations are conducted through employee agents from three call center locations, which we refer to as our retail channel. In addition, Efinancial operates as a wholesale agency, assisting independent agents that desire to work for the carriers that Efinancial represents, which we refer to as our wholesale channel.\nFactors Affecting Our Results\nInterest income from mortgage loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method. Accrual of income is generally suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Mortgage loans are considered past due when full principal or interest payments have not been received according to contractual terms.\ncan be paid by Illinois life insurance companies to shareholders without 30 days prior notice to the Illinois Director of Insurance is the greater of (i) statutory net income for the preceding year or (ii) 10% of statutory surplus as of the preceding year-end. Under Illinois insurance statutes, dividends may be paid only from surplus, excluding unrealized appreciation in value of investments, without prior approval. Dividends in excess of these amounts require advance approval of the Illinois Director of Insurance. There are no limitations on the amount of dividends that Efinancial can pay.\nEfinancial also generates insurance lead sales revenue through its eCoverage web presence. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our Agency Segment revenue earned 85% and 78% through the retail channel, 5% and 8% through the wholesale channel, and 10% and 14% through insurance lead sales revenue, respectively.\nCore Life - Our Core Life insurance business is the primary business of the Insurance Segment. Core Life represents a significant portion of the insurance business written by Fidelity Life since it resumed independent operations in 2005. Our Core Life business consists of in\u00adforce policies that are considered to be of high strategic importance to Fidelity Life.\nDuring the years ended 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors of Fidelity Life approved the payment of $0.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in dividends to VHI. The dividends provided operating funds to VHI to support corporate operations and initiatives. Following the Conversion, Fidelity Life has agreed not to pay any common stock dividends without the approval of a majority of the company designees. In connection with the approval of the Conversion by the Illinois Director of Insurance, we agreed, for a period of twenty-four months following the completion of the offerings, to seek the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance for any declaration of an ordinary dividend by Fidelity Life.\nAll applicable adopted accounting pronouncements have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nFor the assumed life line of business sensitivity testing, there is also no remaining DAC. Under all the sensitivity tests on this line, no benefit reserve increases are needed.\nInvestments\nIn the second quarter 2020, Fidelity Life entered into a General Agent's agreement with an unaffiliated third party, National Service Group of AmeriLife, LLC ( AmeriLife\u201d). This agreement provides Fidelity Life access to AmeriLife distribution channels, its commission systems and assists in streamlining administrative processes related to commissions. This agreement also allows Efinancial to operate as a sub agent to AmeriLife. On May 15, 2020, the Company began selling products using this new distribution arrangement.\nOur investment strategy and guidelines are developed by management and approved by the investment committee of Fidelity Life's Board of Directors. Our investment strategy related to our Insurance Segment is designed to maintain a well-diversified, high quality fixed maturity portfolio that will provide adequate levels of net investment income and liquidity to meet our policyholder obligations under our life insurance policies and our assumed annuity deposits. To help maintain liquidity, we establish the duration of invested assets within a tolerance to the policy liability duration. The investments of our Insurance Segment are managed with an emphasis on current income within quality and diversification constraints. The focus is on book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio as the anticipated portfolio yield is a key element used in pricing our insurance products and establishing policyholder crediting rates on our annuity contracts.\n \u2022 future economic conditions in the markets in which we compete that could be less favorable than expected and could have impacts on demand for our products and services; \nRevenue-our Agency Segment recognizes all commission revenue earned in the year the policy goes in force at the carrier.\nWe have not accepted new policies in these legacy lines since 2006 or prior, and these lines are considered to be in run-off\u201d with a declining number of policies in force each period. We recognize income on the Closed Block, and annuities and assumed life to the extent that premium revenues and net investment income exceed the benefit expenses and operating expenses (including paid and accrued policyholder dividends) of these lines of business. On the two annuity lines, we recognize income (loss) to the extent that our net investment income earned exceeds (are less than) benefit expenses (direct annuities) and amounts credited on policy deposits (assumed annuities) and operating expenses of the two lines.\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our income tax benefit was $2.3 million compared to an income tax benefit of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased benefit of $1.4 million reflects increased net loss attributable to the life sub-group. The non-life sub-group, which has a full valuation allowance, therefore no tax impact. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes.\u201d\nOur consolidated DAC will be lower relative to other insurance companies that utilize unaffiliated distributors. GAAP does not permit the deferral of commission revenues paid to Efinancial, our affiliated agency, in excess of those expenses actually incurred by Efinancial in the placement of the policy. Because we are focused on increasing insurance premium volume through Efinancial, our operating results will reflect higher current period expenses and lower current reported net income. Therefore, in consolidation, the first-year commission acquisition costs ( Commission DAC\u201d) recorded in our Insurance Segment is reduced to reflect the elimination of that portion of Commission DAC that results from expenses of Efinancial that cannot be directly tied to the successful placement of a policy. The amount of eliminated Commission DAC is charged to current expense, and acquisition cost DAC is recorded at a reduced amount, which represents the amount of Commission DAC that is eligible for deferral. As a result of recognizing a majority of expenses for the Efinancial sales immediately, we will recognize a charge against our consolidated earnings (loss) and consolidated equity in the amount of such expenses for the period in which they are incurred. See Results of Operations-Analysis of Segment Results-Corporate Segment-Intercompany Eliminations.\u201d\nBenefits and Expenses\nMortgage Loans\nOur fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale\u201d securities, which are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. For investments that are not actively traded, the determination of fair value requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Fair value determinations include consideration of both observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. Security pricing is applied using a hierarchy approach.\nlines of business using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without provision for adverse deviation. If benefit reserves minus the DAC asset are less than the present value of future cash flows on the line of business, then first the DAC asset will be reduced. If reducing the DAC asset down to zero is still not sufficient to eliminate the premium deficiency, then benefit reserves will be increased. Recognizing a premium deficiency will reduce our reported net income or increase our reported loss, for the period.\nThe results of our Insurance Segment were as follows:\nThe amortization of DAC for traditional life insurance products is determined as a level proportion of premium based on actuarial methods and assumptions about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments, established by us at the time the policy is issued. GAAP requires that assumptions for these types of products not be modified while the policy is outstanding. Amortization is adjusted each period to reflect policy lapse or termination rates compared to anticipated experience. Accordingly, acceleration of DAC amortization could occur if policies terminate earlier than originally assumed. We establish the assumptions used to determine DAC amortization based on estimates using Company experience and other relevant information that is used to price the products. We monitor our actual experience and will update the actuarial factors applied to future policy issues if warranted. The selection of actuarial assumptions requires considerable judgment and has inherent uncertainty. Should actual policy lapse experience be higher than that assumed during a reporting period, we will amortize our DAC balance faster and report lower net income.\nThe interest credited primarily relates to amounts that contract-holders earn on any contract-holder deposits from our assumed annuity contracts and other amounts left on deposit with us. Our universal life policies and assumed annuity contracts require Fidelity Life to periodically establish the crediting rate to be paid on policyholder and contract-holder deposits. All current assumed annuity contracts are credited with interest at the minimum interest rate guaranteed in the contract. Interest credited relates solely to our Insurance Segment.\n \u2022 the potential impact on our reported net income that could result from the adoption of future accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies; \nNet Premiums\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRisk-Based Capital\nWe own a diversified portfolio of investments including cash, bonds, commercial mortgages, and common stock. Each of these investments is subject, in varying degree, to market risk that can affect their return and their fair value. Bonds are the majority of our investments and include debt issues of corporations, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, or obligations of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and are classified as fixed maturity investments in our financial statements. Our investment portfolios are subject to market risks.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\nDue to the continued growth in Fidelity Life's sales of new insurance policies and the dividends to VHI ($0.0 million in 2020 and $5.0 million in 2019 to provide working capital), Fidelity Life's statutory surplus has been declining. The accounting principles applicable to regulatory reporting require that insurance companies expense all policy acquisition costs as incurred. Acquisition expenses attributable to Fidelity Life's increasing new business growth have resulted in net losses being reported for regulatory reporting purposes. Regulatory accounting principles allow limited recognition of the future benefits of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we recognize no income tax benefit that would offset our operating losses for regulatory reporting purposes.\nUnder our commission financing arrangement with Hannover Life, Fidelity Life is able to pay level annual commissions instead of first-year-only commissions to Efinancial for sales of RAPIDecision\u00ae Life policies, and Hannover Life advances to Efinancial amounts approximately equal to first-year-only commissions for sales of those policies. This arrangement reduces Fidelity Life's surplus strain associated with issuing RAPIDecision\u00ae Life business while helping to provide liquidity for Efinancial through the receipt of larger first-year-only commissions. We are able to obtain advances up to $30.0 million under our arrangement with Hannover Life. As of December 31, 2020, we had net advances of $27.5 million under this arrangement.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.\nEarned Commission\n \u2022 Policy acquisition costs (consisting of agent commissions, policy underwriting and issue costs) exceed the amount of first year premium received from the policyholder, \nNet Investment Income\nThe calculation of future policy reserves requires the use of significant judgment and is inherently uncertain. If our actual experience differs from the experience assumed in establishing our reserves, the impact of these differences is reflected in the results of operations in each period. If actual claims are higher than assumed claims experience, our reported income (loss) will be reduced (increased) for the periods in which this experience occurs. If actual policy lapses are higher than that assumed, our future policy benefit reserves will be reduced for the period in which this experience occurs.\nAgency Segment\nLevel 3-Fair values are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. Level 3 instruments include less liquid securities for which significant inputs are unobservable in the market, such as structured securities with complex features that require significant management assumptions or estimation in the fair value measurement. Level 3 hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nEarned commission revenue consists of amounts received and due from insurance carriers on policies sold by Efinancial and is recorded in our Agency Segment. However, the commission revenue from sales of Fidelity Life policies is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations because Efinancial and Fidelity Life are affiliated.\nNet (Loss) Income\nEarned Commissions\nFor our Insurance Segment, the costs of acquiring new business are deferred to the extent that they are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions paid in the first policy year that are in excess of the ultimate renewal commissions payable on the policy. For any of our policies for which we do not pay renewal commissions, the deferred acquisition costs (at the segment level) include all commissions paid in the first year. For policies for which we pay levelized commissions over the life of the policy, we expense the first-year commission and therefore do not defer any other commission expense. We also defer costs associated with policy underwriting and issuance related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts. Non-deferred first year acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred include expenses that do not meet the definition of a deferrable cost, which includes the acquisition costs incurred on insurance applications that do not result in an in-force policy (unsuccessful efforts).\nIn our Agency Segment, insurance lead sales revenue consists of (i) click-through revenues we generate when leads click through to our webpages to access information about life insurance options sponsored by another company and (ii) data revenues we generate through the sale of information regarding leads.\nDue to the valuation allowance on the non-life subgroup, the effective income tax rate reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Operations will vary depending on the portion of our pretax income (loss) that results from our life subgroup and the portion from our non-life subgroup. With the current full valuation allowance, the current tax benefit related to our non-life subgroup is limited. We continue to record tax expense (benefit) related to the pretax income (loss) of our life subgroup.\nOur review of our available-for-sale securities for impairment includes an analysis of impaired securities in terms of severity and/or age of the gross unrealized loss. Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the issuer of the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the likelihood for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential that includes the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, collateral position, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether expected cash flows will be sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nNet premiums consist of direct life insurance premiums due and collected from our policyholders on in-force insurance policies and premiums collected on assumed life reinsurance contracts, less reinsurance premiums paid to reinsurers. Direct premiums are recorded in our Insurance Segment and classified as first year premiums when they relate to the first calendar year coverage period. Premiums for policies outside their first calendar year are called renewal premiums.\nLevel 2-This level includes fixed maturity securities priced principally by independent pricing services using observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; and model-derived valuations for which all significant inputs are observable market data. Level 2 instruments include most corporate debt securities and U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities that are valued by models using inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K constitutes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. You should review Forward Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nIncluded with the future policy benefits is the liability for contract-holder deposits on deferred annuity contracts assumed through two reinsurance agreements effective in 1991 and 1992 and certain other policy funds left on deposit with the Company. The aggregate liability for deposits is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $16.7 million compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.6 million includes a $2.2 million decrease in Closed Block, primarily due to lapses partially offset by an increase in our Core and Non-Core lines of $0.6 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 the inability to maintain or grow our strategic partnerships or our inability to realize the expected benefits from our relationship with the Standby Purchaser; \nVericity, Inc. Consolidated Results of Operations\nWe apply our overall investment strategy and guidelines on a consolidated basis for purposes of monitoring compliance with our overall guidelines. Almost all of our investments are owned by Fidelity Life and are maintained in compliance with insurance regulations. Critical guidelines of our investment plan include:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, life, annuity and health claim benefits were $77.7 million compared with $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $15.8 million was mainly attributable to an increase of $4.8 million in net claim benefits resulting from $6.8 million higher claim activity on certain Core and Non-Core products, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in annuities and assumed life. Change in benefit reserves increased $11.1 million, primarily related to $1.4 million in our Core and Non-Core lines, $5.9 million in Closed Block and $4.4 million in assumed life resulting from the recapture of the majority of an assumed life block of business, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in annuities.\nThe results of this segment consist of net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) earned on invested assets. We also include certain corporate expenses that are not allocated to our other segments, including expenses of Vericity, Inc., board expenses, allocation of executive management time spent on corporate matters, and financial reporting and auditing costs related to our consolidation and internal controls. Our Corporate Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses) exceed (are less than) corporate expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net insurance premiums were $108.0 million compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $13.6 million was primarily due to growth in our Core Life lines of $5.9 million, mainly driven by increases in LifeTime Benefit Term (LBT) and RAPIDecision\u00ae Life and a $7.1 million increase in Closed Block and annuities of $0.5 million.\nWhen the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3).\nForward-Looking Statements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net decrease in cash of $1.6 million compared to net increase of $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash from operating activities increased by $8.1 million, mainly due to higher premium volume, partially offset by higher claim benefits and general operating expenses. Cash used by investing activities decreased, primarily due to net sales of short-term investments in 2020. In 2019, proceeds from the IPO were included in financing activities and partially offset in investing activities through the purchase of short-term investments.\nAt December 31, 2020, total equity decreased to $195.2 million from $212.4 million at December 31, 2019. This decrease in equity of $17.2 million consists of a net loss of $25.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million of other comprehensive income.\nWe are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the FHLBC\u201d). As a member, we are able to borrow on a collateralized basis from the FHLBC. We own FHLBC common stock with a book value of $0.1 million, which allows us to borrow up to $2.3 million. Interest on borrowed funds is charged at variable rates established from time to time by the FHLBC based on the interest rate option selected at the time of the borrowing. There have been no borrowings under this facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Agency Segment incurred a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net loss of $6.2 million was primarily the result of higher earned commissions and a reduction of operating costs and expenses, partially offset by lower insurance lead sales revenue.\n \u2022 Liquidity guidelines that limit the amount of illiquid assets that can be held at any time, and \nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe major components of operating revenues, benefits and expenses and net (loss) income are as follows:\nFidelity Life engages in the following business lines:\n \u2022 the effect of challenges to our patents and other intellectual property; \nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The measures governments worldwide have enacted to combat the pandemic have resulted in disruptions in global and local supply chains and have led to adverse impacts on economic and market conditions as well as increases in unemployment. The severity of COVID-19 and duration of government containment actions have impacted both employees and customers of the Company and presented material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company's performance, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAll of the fair values of our fixed maturity and equity securities within Level 2 are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services. All of our prices for each security are generally sourced from multiple pricing vendors, and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type and region of the world, based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. We ultimately use the price from the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type and region. For fixed maturity securities that do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications which incorporate a variety of inputs including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and U.S. Treasury curves. Specifically, for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Securities with validated quotes from pricing services are reflected within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as they generally are based on observable pricing for similar assets or other market significant observable inputs.\nOur Insurance Segment revenues consist of net insurance premiums, net investment income, and net realized gains (losses) on investments. Our distributors consist of Efinancial and the independent insurance agencies that we contract with to sell our insurance products to the customers (policyholders) who buy our insurance policies. We recognize premium revenue from our policyholders. We purchase reinsurance coverage to help manage the risk on our insurance policies by paying, or ceding, a portion of the policyholder premiums to the reinsurance companies. Our net insurance premiums reflect amounts collected from policyholders, plus premiums assumed under reinsurance agreements less premiums ceded to reinsurance companies. Net investment income represents primarily interest income earned on fixed maturity securities that we purchase with cash flows from our premium revenues. We also realize gains and losses on sales of investment securities. These investments support our liability for policy reserves and provide the capital required to operate our insurance business. Capital requirements are primarily established by regulatory authorities. See Note 2-Investments\u201d and Business-Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\u201d\n \u2022 our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities either through acquisitions or organically; \nFidelity Life is a party to various services and cost sharing agreements with VHI and Efinancial pursuant to which certain costs and expenses incurred by VHI and Efinancial on behalf of Fidelity Life are allocated to Fidelity Life and reimbursed to the entity incurring the expense.\nNet Investment Income\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nFidelity Life's ability to pay dividends to Vericity Holdings, Inc. (VHI) is limited by the insurance laws of the State of Illinois. All shareholder dividends are subject to notice filings with the Illinois Director of Insurance. The maximum amount of dividends that\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss was $8.3 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net loss of $7.1 million resulted primarily from higher life, annuity and health claim benefits, lower net investment income, lower net realized gains and increases in net operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in net insurance premiums and lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity profile of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalty.\nClosed Block\nWe conduct our business through our two operating subsidiaries, Fidelity Life, an Illinois-domiciled life insurance company, and Efinancial, a call center-based insurance agency. Efinancial sells Fidelity Life products through its own call center distribution platform, independent agents and other marketing organizations. Efinancial, in addition to offering Fidelity Life products, sells insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. We report our operating results in three segments: Agency, Insurance and Corporate.\nOur primary revenue sources are life insurance premiums, commissions, net investment income, net realized investment gains (losses), insurance lead sales and other income.\n \u2022 Asset concentration guidelines that limit the amount that we hold in any one issuer of securities, \nCredit risk is the risk of loss due to an adverse change in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer or, in the case of a securitized investment, adverse change in the assets being securitized. We address credit risk by establishing minimum rating standards for investments that our portfolio managers can acquire and, in the case of a downgrade, continue to hold the investment. For our core fixed maturity portfolio, which comprises a significant majority of our invested assets, only investment grade securities (minimum credit rating for new investments is BBB- as established by Standard & Poor's or a comparable nationally recognized statistical rating organization) can be purchased and such portfolio managers must maintain an overall credit rating for the portfolio of at least A-. Through our portfolio managers, we monitor the financial condition of all the issues of securities that we own. As an additional step to reduce our exposure to credit risk, we have established diversification guidelines limiting the total amount of holding by issuer and by investment sector.\nExpense-our Insurance Segment recognizes the first-year commission as a policy acquisition cost, in proportion to the premiums earned from providing insurance coverage throughout the first year that the policy is in force. In addition, our Insurance Segment defers the amount by which the first-year commission acquisition costs exceed the ultimate renewal commission and records this amount as deferred acquisition cost that is amortized over the expected life of the policy.\nwhich temporary differences are deductible or creditable. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recognized deferred tax asset value may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.\nCash uses in our Insurance Segment result in negative operating cash flows related to sales of new insurance policies because:\nFor the Open Block sensitivity testing, DAC is still recoverable under the lapse sensitivity test. However, under the mortality and investment earned rates sensitivity tests, the DAC would have to be decreased by $5.9 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nOur critical accounting policies are described in Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was a valuation allowance of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nIntercompany Eliminations\nOverview\nUnder applicable Federal income tax guidance, the taxation of life insurance companies is subject to special rules not applicable to other (non-life) companies. Accordingly, we have to consider the implications of these different tax rules in accounting for income tax expense, as separately applicable to our life and non-life subgroups of companies.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, insurance lead sales were $5.0 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease of $1.3 million was primarily due to lower click and transfer revenue.\nLevel 3 fair value classification consists of investments in structured securities where the fair value of the security is determined by a pricing service using internal pricing models where one or more of the significant inputs is unobservable in the marketplace, or there is a single broker/dealer quote. The fair value of a broker-quoted asset is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. The Company does not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset.\n \u2022 financial market conditions, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates and the level and trends of stock market prices causing a reduction of net investment income or realized losses and reduction in the value of our investment portfolios; \nOperating Costs and Expenses\nBenefits and Expenses\nWe establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to realize the value of the deferred tax asset. We evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis. Negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years. Positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income and tax-planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe record federal income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on pre-tax income as determined using GAAP accounting. The timing of the recognition of certain income and expense items for GAAP accounting can differ from the timing of recognition of the same income and expense items in our federal tax returns. The timing of recognition in the federal tax return is based on tax laws and regulations. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is different than that reported in the tax returns.\n\nThe results of the Corporate Segment are as follows:\nNet Insurance Premiums\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consists of the assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. The annuity liabilities are reducing each period due to cash withdrawals by contract-holders on this block of annuities that were primarily written in the late 1980s. Cash deposits to these annuity contracts are minimal compared to cash withdrawal activity. Also included in financing cash flows are net proceeds from our commission financing program.\n\nThis segment consists of the operations of Fidelity Life. Fidelity Life underwrites primarily term life insurance through Efinancial and a diverse group of independent insurance distributors. Fidelity Life specializes in life insurance products that can be issued immediately or within a short period following a sales call, using non-medical underwriting at the time of policy issuance.\nWe invest our available cash and funds that support our regulatory capital, surplus requirements and policy reserves in investment securities that are included in our Insurance and Corporate Segments. We earn income on these investments in the form of interest on fixed maturity securities (bonds and mortgage loans) and dividends (from equity holdings). Net investment income is recorded net of investment related expenses as revenue. The amount of net investment income that we recognize will vary depending on the amount of invested assets that we own, the types of investments we own, the interest rates earned and amount of dividends received on our investments.\nAgency Segment expenses consist of marketing costs to acquire potential customers, salary and bonuses paid to our employee agents, salary and other costs of employees involved in managing the underwriting process for our insurance applications, sales management, agent licensing, training and compliance costs. Other Agency Segment expenses include costs associated with financial and administrative employees, facilities rent, and information technology. After payroll, the most significant Agency Segment expense is the cost of acquiring leads. We are able to partially offset our sales leads expense through advertising revenues from individuals who click on specific advertisements while viewing one of our web pages, and through the resale of leads that are not well suited for our call center. For years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, these offsetting revenues were $5.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, which reduced our total agency expenses by approximately 10% and 11%, respectively. Our Agency Segment recognizes income (loss) to the extent that commissions and other revenue exceed (are less than) our marketing and overhead costs for the period.\nUnder an agreement with Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective Life), the successor to a former affiliate of Fidelity Life, Fidelity Life had assumed a portion of risk on a group of life insurance contracts primarily written in the 1980s and early 1990s. On March 29, 2019, Protective Life and Fidelity Life agreed that Protective Life would recapture the majority of this assumed life block of business, thereby relieving Fidelity Life from further liability under the recaptured business (except for obligations incurred prior to the recapture effective date). Under the recapture agreement, Fidelity Life paid Protective Life an amount equal to the assumed carried reserves, and in turn, Fidelity Life will receive payment from its reinsurers of this business for their portion of the related ceded reserves. We recognized a $2.2 million gain from this transaction in 2019.\nWe performed the following sensitivity tests as of September 30, 2020:\nSee Note 2 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOne key measure of our net investment income is the book yield on our holdings of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, which holdings totaled $363.9 million and $314.9 million, and represented 85.7% and 77.2% of our invested assets, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Book yield is the effective interest rate, before investment expenses, that we earn on these investments. Book yield is calculated as the percent of net investment income to the average amortized cost of the underlying investments for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our book yield on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale was 3.9% and 4.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCorporate Segment\nThe block where there are no dividends expected had a significant number of policies issued in December 1999 which had level premiums for the first 20 durations, followed by premiums which increased significantly in duration 21 as the premiums from that point forward go to an annually increasing scale. The approximate increase in premiums going from the 20th to the 21st duration is 1300%. Direct policies are a mixture of annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly premium payment modes, whereas ceded policies are all annual premium mode. Therefore, both direct and ceded premiums increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2019 on the Closed Block compared to the prior year as this group of policies ended their level term with larger impacts affecting ceded premiums more than direct premiums as a result of these modal differences.\nInsurance Lead Sales\nWe have experienced net negative cash flows in 2020 and in most prior periods due to continued growth in sales of our life insurance products and in our Agency operations and through continued net withdrawals on assumed annuity contract-holder deposits. Our annuity deposits are in run-off because we do not market annuity contracts to generate annuity deposits to offset the withdrawal activity on in-force contracts.\nOur Corporate Segment experienced negative cash flows as a result of the payment of allocated overhead expenses.\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses\n\nThis category consists of benefits to policyholders, which include policyholder dividends and policyholder dividend obligations (PDO), interest credited to policyholder and contract-holder balances, general operating expenses and amortization of DAC.\nThe following analysis reconciles the reported segment results to the Vericity, Inc. total consolidated results. The main difference is the intercompany eliminations.\nGains and losses on sales of investments are classified as net realized investment gains (losses) and are recorded as revenue. Capital appreciation and depreciation caused by changes in the market value of investments classified as available-for-sale\u201d is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of investment gains and losses that we recognize depends on the amount of and the types of invested assets we own and the market conditions related to those investments. Our cash needs can vary from time to time and could require that we sell invested assets to fund cash needs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 51: <table> <tr> <td> Fair Value of Investments as of December
