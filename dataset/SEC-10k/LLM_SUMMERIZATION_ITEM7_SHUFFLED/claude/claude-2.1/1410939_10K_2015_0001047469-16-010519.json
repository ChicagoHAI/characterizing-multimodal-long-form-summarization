Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. Our most advanced product candidate is Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib), which is in Phase 3 clinical development for use in combination with anti-VEGF drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. We have completed one Phase 1 and one Phase 2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab), have completed patient enrollment for two Phase 3 clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis and expect to complete enrollment in a third Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) or Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab) in 2016. We have completed enrollment in two additional Phase 2a clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), one of which is studying the potential of Fovista to reduce subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients and the other of which is investigating the optimized regimen of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, as well as the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We are also developing our product candidate Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol) as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. We are also investigating the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option for a license.\nFovista Phase 3 Clinical Program\nOur pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista consists of three separate Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs\nfor the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials, are evaluating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The third trial, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, is evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our development strategy for Fovista is to be agnostic with respect to the choice of the anti-VEGF drug administered in combination with Fovista.\nWe completed patient enrollment in one of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trial in November 2015. The Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials are investigating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy and are identical with respect to the trial design in the first year. Therefore, the databases from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials will be locked and analyzed together, which will allow for the pooled analysis of certain relevant endpoints in accordance with the statistical analysis plan. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016, with initial, top-line data from this trial to be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates. This trial is investigating Fovista in combination with either Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our Phase 2b trial utilized Lucentis as the only anti-VEGF drug because Eylea was not yet approved and Avastin's non-inferiority status compared to Lucentis was not yet established at the time the Phase 2b clinical trial commenced. Therefore, in order to gain more experience with Fovista when administered in combination with Eylea or Avastin prior to starting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial started later (May 2014) than the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials (August 2013). This time period of approximately nine months allowed us to perform initial preclinical and clinical assessments and ensure compatibility of Eylea or Avastin when administered in combination with Fovista.\nOur key objective and plan is to make Fovista commercially available to physicians to treat their patients with wet AMD as quickly as possible, subject to a favorable data outcome from the Phase 3 clinical program. We are continuing to explore various regulatory filing options. We plan to initially submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis.\nFovista Expansion Studies\nIn addition to our ongoing Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, we have initiated additional clinical trials to evaluate the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients. We refer to these trials collectively as the Fovista Expansion Studies. They include:\n\u2022 OPH1005 Fovista Anti-Fibrosis Study. During the third quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), to study subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in May 2015 with a total of 101 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial are followed over a 24-month period.\n\u2022 OPH1006 Fovista Treatment Burden Reduction Study. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) to investigate the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in\nOctober 2015 with a total of 64 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial followed over an 18-month period.\n\u2022 OPH1007 Fovista in Combination with Avastin Discontinuous Regimen Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with Avastin during the maintenance phase of wet AMD treatment compared to a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of Avastin monotherapy.\n\u2022 OPH1008 Fovista Imaging Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to investigate the role of multi-modal imaging in assessing anatomic responses to various wet AMD treatment regimens of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin).\nWe may in the future seek to pursue additional clinical trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of Fovista in wet AMD as well as other ophthalmic conditions.\nNovartis Agreement\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans.\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we achieved in September 2014 and received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we achieved in March 2015 and received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis also is obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on sales of Fovista products.\nWe have retained control over the design and execution of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis's\nresponsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in the Phase 3 trials already initiated and in other Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in the Novartis Territory initiated following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\nIn November 2015, we were informed by Novartis that Genentech, Inc., a Roche wholly-owned subsidiary, elected to exercise its option to participate in the financial arrangements relating to Novartis' rights under the Novartis Agreement. Roche's option originated from a pre-existing agreement between Roche and Novartis. The ex-U.S. commercialization agreement between Ophthotech and Novartis and its financial terms remained unchanged as a result of the exercise of the opt-in right. We continue to retain sole rights to Fovista in the United States.\nZimura Clinical Development\nCurrently, we have the following ongoing clinical trials for Zimura:\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated, a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. We plan to enroll approximately 300 patients in the initial stage of the trial. During this stage, patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive monthly injections of 1.0 mg of Zimura per eye, monthly injections of 2.0 mg of Zimura per eye or monthly sham injections as the control arm. At month 18, we plan to conduct an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Zimura compared to sham. Upon review of this interim analysis, a determination will be made whether to continue the trial and whether to expand the trial by enrolling additional patients. Patients in the trial will receive monthly injections for 24 months.\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) for the treatment of wet AMD.\n\u2022 Zimura PCV Study. In late 2014, we commenced a very small, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial investigating Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. Our initial, preliminary analysis of the data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.\nOverview of Funding History and Requirements\nWe were incorporated and commenced active operations in 2007. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring rights to product candidates, business planning, raising capital and developing Fovista and Zimura. We acquired our rights to Fovista from (OSI) Eyetech, Inc., or Eyetech, in July 2007. The acquisition included an assignment of license rights and obligations under an agreement with Archemix Corp. We have licensed rights to our product candidate Zimura from Archemix Corp. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $405.5 million. Our net loss was $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in 2016 and potentially 2017. We have not generated any revenues from product sales and have financed our\noperations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding under our royalty purchase and sale agreement with Novo A/S, which we refer to as the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. We received net proceeds from our initial public offering of $175.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on public offering of $55.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We have received $125.0 million of funding under the Novo Agreement, which constitutes the full amount of funding under that agreement. We also received an upfront payment of $200.0 million from Novartis upon the execution of the Novartis Agreement and enrollment-based milestone payments of $50.0 million in October 2014 and $50.0 million in April 2015.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program, as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp. and Nektar Therapeutics, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations. Furthermore, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur costs associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our facilities. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Funding Requirements\" for a discussion of factors affecting our future capital requirements.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates that we may develop. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, or $100.0 million in aggregate, under the Novartis Agreement. We recognized revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,083 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,373 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> API transfer revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,505 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenue from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments and research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of certain milestone and other payments, if any, that we may receive from Novartis and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until the end of 2017 at the earliest. If we fail to complete the development of Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates we may develop, in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical testing and manufacturing of Fovista and Zimura, as well as costs associated with the preclinical development of other product candidates and formulations. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n\u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners.\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research\nand Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made.\nTo date, the large majority of our research and development work has been related to Fovista and Zimura. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the development of and seek marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura and, possibly, other product candidates.\nWe do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fovista\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>86,906 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>66,095 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>26,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Zimura\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel-related\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,770 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,062 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>131,012 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>88,385 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>33,215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that we will incur significant research and development expenses in connection with conducting our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and, if such trials are successful, seeking marketing approval for Fovista. We also expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through our Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially, in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as a result of the pursuit of our Zimura development programs. We expect these research and development expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. In addition, we expect that we will incur significant expenses related to manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities.\nOur current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at\nleast the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and seek marketing approval for Fovista or Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. See \"Risk Factors.\" This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\n\u2022 the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies;\n\u2022 clinical trial results;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 our ability, together with any commercialization partner's ability, to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 our ability to successfully file, prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights, together with associated expenses.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate we may develop could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of Fovista or any other product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSee the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section on page 149 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our current and future financial resources and our expectations regarding our research and development expenses and funding requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, commercial and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities and as a result of increased personnel, including management personnel to support our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, expanded infrastructure, increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company and increased insurance premiums, among other factors.\nInterest Income\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone under the Novartis Agreement, or\n$100.0 million in the aggregate. We recognized collaboration revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,083 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,373 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> API transfer revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,505 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenues from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments, research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The terms of this agreement and other potential collaboration or commercialization agreements we may enter into generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical, clinical or commercial material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; payments for manufactured material; and royalties on future product sales.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (\"TPE\") of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We use BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our BESP, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\nWhen management believes the license to our intellectual property and products has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. When management believes such a license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nAt the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe aggregate our milestones into three categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, and (iii) commercial milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase or when a contractually specified clinical trial enrollment target is attained. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission of an application for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.\nRevenues from clinical and development and regulatory milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. With regards to the Novartis Agreement, we have concluded that the clinical and development milestones and certain reimbursement approval milestones are not substantive and that the marketing approval milestones are substantive. Milestone payments received that are not considered substantive are included in the allocable arrangement consideration and are recognized as revenue in proportion to the relative-selling price allocation established at the inception of the arrangement. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nRoyalty Purchase Liability\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under the Novo Agreement have been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Because there is a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our balance sheet. As we make royalty payments to Novo A/S in accordance with the Novo Agreement, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such\namounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected common stock price volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>72% </td> <td> </td> <td>82% </td> <td> </td> <td>83% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.35% - 2.24% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.61% - 2.13% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89% - 2.94% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term of options (years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $24.8 million, $13.0 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $49.8 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.6 years. We expect our share-based compensation for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we allocated share-based compensation as follows:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16,608 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,594 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,062 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,760 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,040 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2014, we received $83.3 million from Novo A/S under the Novo Agreement, which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. Also in 2014, we received $200.0 million from Novartis upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, a portion of which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. In addition, we received a milestone payment of $50.0 million in 2014 from Novartis which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. As a result of these payments, and after taking into account the utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards and utilization of our research and development tax credits, we reported taxable income for tax purposes in 2014. We made income tax payments of $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. We incurred tax losses for 2015 and as such, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets has been released, where appropriate. See Note 9 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Increase\n(Decrease) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>51,505 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,246 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,627 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,261 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(123,528 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,513 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>43,015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>754 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122,504 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,296 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>42,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (benefit) provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,787 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>36,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,263 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(105,717 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(116,772 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(11,055 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Using the relative selling price method, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we allocated $38.1 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.3 million, of which $38.4 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $42.6 million compared to $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $19.8 million milestone payment we made in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which represented a significant portion of our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $40.6 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $3.3 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing and clinical trial costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $9.0 million increase to share-based compensation costs\nand a $6.3 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $10.6 million, compared to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $3.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $2.7 million, an increase of $1.4 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for pre-launch commercialization activities, professional services and consulting fees of $2.0 million.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million compared to interest income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our expected tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $36.5 million, which primarily related to taxable income that resulted from payments we received under the Novartis Agreement and the Novo Agreement in 2014.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Increase\n(Decrease) </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,259 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,513 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,425 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>33,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,454 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,671 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,091 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,091 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,175 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80,296 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>29,151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116,772 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>65,627 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: accretion of preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,891 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,891 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(116,772 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(57,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $41.3 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $38.4 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $55.2 million compared to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $25.3 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the initiation of certain Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials. The increase was also due to a higher milestone payment of $19.8 million that we made in June 2014 in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, as compared to $3.5 million in milestone payments we made in 2013 in connection with the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trials in August 2013. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $4.4 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $5.5 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $4.7 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $33.4 million, an increase of $19.2 million compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $4.6 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $7.0 million increase to personnel costs. These increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, as well as the hiring of additional management and corporate staffing, costs related to an executive retirement and other one-time post-employment costs. Also contributing to the increase were increased professional services and consulting fees, infrastructure costs, insurance costs and travel costs.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.2 million compared to net interest expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a result of a significant increase in our investment portfolio average balances during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The amounts recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to interest expense associated with our venture debt facility that we entered into in June 2012. The debt facility was paid off in May 2013 and as such, there was no corresponding interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Loss\nThere was no other loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to other loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Amounts recorded as other loss were due to the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability recorded in the first half of 2013. Upon completion of our initial public offering on September 30, 2013, the preferred stock warrants were converted to common stock warrants and are now treated as permanent equity.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $36.5 million. This primarily relates to the payments we received from Novartis and Novo A/S in 2014, a significant portion of which contributed to an increase in taxable income for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record a provision for income taxes due to our significant operating losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in\nseparate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, of which, $50.0 million was received in October 2014 and $50.0 million was received in April 2015. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million under one of our license agreements. We are entitled to certain additional future payments from Novartis based on the continued clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of Fovista. See \"Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\" below for further information.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $391.9 million and no debt. We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(78,531 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>111,088 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(48,775 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing Activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(427,817 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing Activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>255,072 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>182,047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(170,782 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>206,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $78.5 million and relates primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista expansion studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses. These expenditures were offset by a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone payment we received in connection with the Novartis Agreement in April 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $111.1 million and related primarily to the receipt of $250.0 million in connection with the Novartis Agreement. Offsetting these cash receipts was a $19.8 million milestone payment to a third party in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, and cash used to fund our efforts to advance our Fovista Phase 3 program, including increased spending on clinical trial costs and manufacturing activity for Fovista.\nWe expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase substantially compared to prior periods and for the foreseeable future for the reasons described below under \"-Funding Requirements\".\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $247.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities totaling $662.0 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $411.6 million and capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our office facilities in New York, New York and the relocation to a new office facility in Princeton, New Jersey. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $427.8 million, which related primarily to the purchase of marketable securities totaling $597.8 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities of $171.6 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $145.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of proceeds of $55.4 million from our follow-on public offering in February 2014, and proceeds of $83.3 million from our royalty agreement with Novo A/S in January 2014.\nFunding Requirements\nOur product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are in clinical development. We expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program. We expect our expenses to increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. For Fovista, our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, is responsible for these commercialization expenses outside the United States. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, and Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. For example, in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, we made a milestone payment of $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics in June 2014. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations.\nWe expect that our expenses will further increase if and as we:\n\u2022 undertake additional clinical development of Fovista, if it is approved, in support of our efforts to broaden the label for Fovista;\n\u2022 conduct additional clinical trials of Zimura that may be required by regulatory authorities, including a second Phase 3 clinical trial for GA, to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\n\u2022 continue to develop tivozanib for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\n\u2022 in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue research and development of, other complementary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technology, for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel;\n\u2022 expand our outsourced manufacturing activities and establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any product candidates;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel and expand our facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $391.9 million. We also had $368.9 million in total liabilities, $338.1 million of which related to the Novo Agreement and deferred revenue associated with the Novartis Agreement.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the potential remaining enrollment-based $30.0 million milestone payment under the Novartis Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned through the end of 2017.\nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the success of our development and commercialization of our product candidates and whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. For example, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials, if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities or corporate staffing. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any delays in completing the clinical trials of Fovista or Zimura, or the development of any of other product candidates that we may develop, our expenses could increase. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations prior than expected.\nMoreover, our current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trials, based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista, process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and potentially seek marketing approval for Fovista and Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of the Fovista Expansion Studies to further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista in wet AMD when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet need;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Zimura clinical programs, including our Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study and our Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study, as well as any additional clinical trials (including a potential second Phase 3 trial for GA) required by regulatory authorities for us to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura;\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews of Fovista and Zimura;\n\u2022 the timing, scope and cost of commercialization activities for Fovista or Zimura if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for either product candidate, including the costs and timing of expanding our outsourced manufacturing activities, including activities to build up our commercial drug supply and to enable and qualify second source suppliers, expanding our commercial operations and establishing product sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, net revenue received from commercial sales of Fovista or Zimura, after milestone payments and royalty payments that we will be obligated to make;\n\u2022 the scope, progress and results of our preclinical studies, formulation development and clinical development plans for tivozanib;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development and/or clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to, and develop, complimentary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technologies; and\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds other than the Novartis Agreement. The remaining potential milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement are subject to our achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial events related to Fovista, none of which can be assured.\nOur future commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of Fovista, Zimura or any other products that we are able to successfully develop, which, depending on the product, may not be available for several years, if at all. In addition, if approved, Fovista or Zimura or any product that we acquire or in-license may not achieve commercial success. If that is the case, we may need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nAdequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may need or may seek to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of assets, including intellectual property rights, as collateral to secure our obligations under the Novo Agreement may limit our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nLicensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis has also granted us options, subject to specified limitations, and to the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products developed by Novartis. We and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products that we or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. We have agreed to exclusively supply Novartis, and Novartis has agreed to exclusively purchase from us, its\nclinical and commercial requirements for the bulk API for Fovista for use in-licensed products in the Novartis Territory. We have agreed not to commercialize any product comprising Fovista or any other anti-PDGF product in the ophthalmic field in the Novartis Territory.\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on all sales of Fovista products.\nNovartis has agreed to pay our manufacturing costs plus a specified percentage margin for commercial supplies of the bulk API for Fovista that we supply to Novartis. If we or Novartis exercise our or its respective rights to obtain access to study data from clinical trials conducted by the other party, the party exercising the option will be obligated to pay the other party's associated past development costs and share equally with such other party any future associated development costs. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize any co-formulated Fovista product in the United States, we will be obligated to pay a specified percentage of Novartis's associated past development costs and share with Novartis any future associated development costs. Novartis and we will also need to negotiate and agree on financial and other terms that would apply to such rights. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop and commercialize a pre-filled syringe product in the United States, we will be obligated to either enter into a supply agreement with Novartis under which we will pay Novartis its manufacturing cost plus a specified percentage margin for supplies of Fovista products in pre-filled syringes that Novartis supplies to us, or obtain supplies of products in pre-filled syringes from a third party manufacturer and pay Novartis a low single-digit percentage of our net sales of such products.\nWe have retained control over the design and execution of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis's responsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials and ongoing Phase 2 trials and future Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in the Novartis Territory following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\nThe Novartis Agreement, unless earlier terminated by Novartis or us, will expire upon the expiration of Novartis's obligation to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed products. Novartis and we each may terminate the Novartis Agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period, if the other party experiences any specified insolvency event, if the other party challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by the terminating party, or if the parties are prevented in any manner that materially adversely affects the progression of the development or commercialization of licensed products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions. Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time without cause, or within a specified period after a change in control of us, as defined in the Novartis Agreement, or for specified safety reasons, effective at the end of a specified period following Novartis's written notice to us of Novartis's election to terminate the agreement. We may also terminate the agreement if Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an alternative anti-PDGF product in the Novartis Territory as more fully described below. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement because specified governmental actions prevent the parties from materially progressing the development or commercialization of licensed products as described above, we will be required to pay a substantial termination fee. Following any termination, all rights to Fovista that we granted to Novartis, including, without limitation, the right to commercialize standalone Fovista products in the Novartis Territory, will revert to us, Novartis will perform specified activities in connection with transitioning to us the rights and responsibilities for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of the standalone Fovista product for countries in the Novartis Territory, and the parties will cooperate on an orderly wind down of development and commercialization activities for other licensed products in the Novartis Territory.\nNovartis has agreed to specified limitations on its ability to in-license, acquire or commercialize any anti-PDGF product that does not contain Fovista, which we refer to as an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product, in the Novartis Territory and, to the extent Novartis develops, in-licenses or acquires such a product, to make such product available to us in the United States under specified option conditions. If we exercise our option, we will be obligated to make certain payments to Novartis, including specified milestone and royalty payments. The amounts of such payments will vary based on the product's stage of clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement, convert Novartis's exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will, subject to specified limitations, be required to pay to us, certain payments based on achievement, with respect to such product, of the milestones that would have otherwise applied to licensed products under the Novartis Agreement.\nThe agreement contains standstill provisions pursuant to which Novartis agrees to certain restrictions relating to our voting securities until marketing approval for a standalone Fovista product is granted in either the United States or the European Union. The agreement contains indemnification and dispute resolution provisions that are customary for agreements of its kind.\nManufacturing and Supply Agreements with Agilent Technologies, Inc.\nClinical API Supply Agreement\nIn May 2014, we entered into a Clinical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our clinical requirements in specified jurisdictions of Fovista API. The clinical supply agreement has an initial five-year term, which\nis subject to automatic renewal absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the clinical supply agreement. The clinical supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis with the price reduced as the volume ordered increases. We may terminate the clinical supply agreement or any statement of work thereunder upon 12 months prior written notice to Agilent and Agilent may terminate the clinical supply agreement if we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of API for Fovista. Each party also has the right to terminate the clinical supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The clinical supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nCommercial API Supply Agreement\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our commercial requirements in all jurisdictions of Fovista API. The commercial supply agreement has an initial term that runs for seven years from the date of our first commercial sale of Fovista, and which is subject to one two-year automatic renewal period, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The commercial supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of Fovista API ordered increases. We may cancel any purchase order under the commercial supply agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the commercial supply agreement with no financial penalty in the event that we cannot commercialize Fovista due to regulatory or other medical, scientific or legal reasons. Agilent may terminate the commercial supply agreement in the event that we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of Fovista API. Each party also has the right to terminate the commercial supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The commercial supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nFinancing Agreement with Novo A/S\nIn May 2013, we entered into the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which we had the ability to obtain financing in three tranches in an amount of up to $125.0 million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage on worldwide sales of Fovista, with the royalty percentage determined by the amount of funding provided by Novo A/S. The three tranches of financing, in which Novo A/S purchased three low single-digit royalty interests and paid us $125.0 million in the aggregate, closed in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014.\nThe royalty payment period begins on the commercial launch of Fovista and ends, on a country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of the twelfth anniversary of the commercial launch of Fovista, the expiration of certain patent rights covering Fovista, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Fovista, in each applicable country. Royalty payments will be payable quarterly in arrears during the royalty period. Our obligations under the Novo Agreement may also apply to certain other anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, products we may develop.\nWe used a portion of the proceeds that we initially received under the Novo Agreement to repay in full an aggregate of $14.4 million of outstanding principal, interest and fees under our venture debt facility and are using the remaining proceeds primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for Fovista and for general corporate expenses.\nThe Novo Agreement requires the establishment by Novo A/S and us of a joint oversight committee in relation to the development of Fovista in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to have a representative on our board of directors. The Novo Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain covenants relating to the operation of our business, including covenants requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue our development of Fovista, to file, prosecute and maintain certain patent rights and, in our reasonable judgment, to pursue claims of infringement of our intellectual property rights. The Novo Agreement also places certain restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to grant security interests in our intellectual property to third parties, to sell, transfer or out-license intellectual property, or to grant others rights to receive royalties on sales of Fovista and certain other products. We reimbursed Novo A/S for specified legal and other expenses and are required to provide Novo A/S with certain continuing information rights. We have agreed to indemnify Novo A/S and its representatives with respect to certain matters, including with respect to any third-party infringement or product liability claims relating to our products. Our obligations under the Novo agreement are secured by a lien on certain of our intellectual property and other rights related to Fovista and other anti-PDGF products we may develop.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due by Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,664 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,133 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,852 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,679 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>29,863 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,332 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,852 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,679 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Operating lease obligations reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with leases for our office space.\n(2)Purchase obligations represent our commitments under purchase orders, including those made under our clinical and commercial supply agreements with Agilent.\n(3)This table does not include (a) any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty, (b) any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known, (c) anticipated expenditures under supply agreements for periods for which we are not yet bound under binding purchase orders, (d) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business that are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above and (e) our royalty purchase liability of $125.0 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the fact that the royalty payment period, if any, is not known.\nIn addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, we may be required, under various agreements, to pay royalties and make milestone payments. In addition to the Novo Agreement, these agreements include the following:\n\u2022 Under our divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC., or OSI Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, for rights to particular anti-PDGF aptamers, including Fovista, we are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals future one-time payments of $12.0 million in the aggregate upon marketing approval in the United States and the European Union of a covered anti-PDGF product. We\nalso are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals a royalty at a low single-digit percentage of net sales of any covered anti-PDGF product we successfully commercialize.\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from any anti-PDGF aptamer, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $14.0 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to Fovista, up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and, for each other anti-PDGF aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, up to an aggregate of approximately $18.8 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from anti-C5 aptamers, for each anti-C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, and up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double-digit percentage of specified non-royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under this license agreement. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\n\u2022 Under a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, for specified pegylation reagents used to manufacture Fovista, we are obligated to make future payments to Nektar of up to an aggregate of $6.5 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones, and an additional payment of $3.0 million if we achieve a specified commercial milestone with respect to Fovista. We are obligated to pay Nektar tiered royalties at low to mid-single-digit percentages of net sales of any licensed product we successfully commercialize, with the royalty percentage determined by our level of licensed product sales, the extent of patent coverage for the licensed product and whether we have granted a third party commercialization rights to the licensed product. In June 2014, we paid Nektar $19.8 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement.\n\u2022 Under an option agreement with AVEO relating to tivozanib, we will be obligated to make milestone payments of $2.0 million upon the submission of an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA and $6.0 million upon the earlier of demonstration of proof of concept in humans and a specified date in January 2017, subject to any exercise by us of our right to terminate the option agreement.\nWe also have letter agreements with certain employees that require the funding of a specific level of payments, if certain events, such as a termination of employment in connection with a change in control or termination of employment by the employee for good reason or by us without cause, occur. For a description of these obligations, see our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, as filed with the SEC on April 30, 2015.\nIn addition, in the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Expenditures to CROs and CMOs represent significant costs in clinical development. Subject to required notice periods and our obligations under binding purchase orders, we can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and even long-term commitments of cash.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under Securities and Exchange

We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates that we may develop. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds other than the Novartis Agreement. The remaining potential milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement are subject to our achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial events related to Fovista, none of which can be assured.\nZimura Clinical Development\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>

We recognized collaboration revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur research and development expenses were $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $55.2 million compared to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $25.3 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the initiation of certain Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials. The increase was also due to a higher milestone payment of $19.8 million that we made in June 2014 in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, as compared to $3.5 million in milestone payments we made in 2013 in connection with the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trials in August 2013. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $4.4 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $5.5 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $4.7 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nIn 2014, we received $83.3 million from Novo A/S under the Novo Agreement, which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. Also in 2014, we received $200.0 million from Novartis upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, a portion of which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. In addition, we received a milestone payment of $50.0 million in 2014 from Novartis which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. As a result of these payments, and after taking into account the utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards and utilization of our research and development tax credits, we reported taxable income for tax purposes in 2014. We made income tax payments of $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. We incurred tax losses for 2015 and as such, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets has been released, where appropriate. See Note 9 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nCollaboration Revenue\nThe provision for income taxes recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $36.5 million. This primarily relates to the payments we received from Novartis and Novo A/S in 2014, a significant portion of which contributed to an increase in taxable income for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record a provision for income taxes due to our significant operating losses.\nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the success of our development and commercialization of our product candidates and whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. For example, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials, if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities or corporate staffing. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any delays in completing the clinical trials of Fovista or Zimura, or the development of any of other product candidates that we may develop, our expenses could increase. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations prior than expected.\n\u2022 OPH1008 Fovista Imaging Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to investigate the role of multi-modal imaging in assessing anatomic responses to various wet AMD treatment regimens of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin).\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel;\n\u2022 Under our divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC., or OSI Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, for rights to particular anti-PDGF aptamers, including Fovista, we are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals future one-time payments of $12.0 million in the aggregate upon marketing approval in the United States and the European Union of a covered anti-PDGF product.

Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Zimura clinical programs, including our Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study and our Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study, as well as any additional clinical trials (including a potential second Phase 3 trial for GA) required by regulatory authorities for us to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\nWhen management believes the license to our intellectual property and products has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. When management believes such a license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nCommercial API Supply Agreement\nOur research and development expenses were $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $42.6 million compared to $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $19.8 million milestone payment we made in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which represented a significant portion of our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $40.6 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $3.3 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing and clinical trial costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $9.0 million increase to share-based compensation costs\n\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under the Novo Agreement have been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Because there is a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our balance sheet. As we make royalty payments to Novo A/S in accordance with the Novo Agreement, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such\nNovartis has agreed to pay our manufacturing costs plus a specified percentage margin for commercial supplies of the bulk API for Fovista that we supply to Novartis. If we or Novartis exercise our or its respective rights to obtain access to study data from clinical trials conducted by the other party, the party exercising the option will be obligated to pay the other party's associated past development costs and share equally with such other party any future associated development costs. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize any co-formulated Fovista product in the United States, we will be obligated to pay a specified percentage of Novartis's associated past development costs and share with Novartis any future associated development costs. Novartis and we will also need to negotiate and agree on financial and other terms that would apply to such rights. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop and commercialize a pre-filled syringe product in the United States, we will be obligated to either enter into a supply agreement with Novartis under which we will pay Novartis its manufacturing cost plus a specified percentage margin for supplies of Fovista products in pre-filled syringes that Novartis supplies to us, or obtain supplies of products in pre-filled syringes from a third party manufacturer and pay Novartis a low single-digit percentage of our net sales of such products.\n\u2022 in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue research and development of, other complementary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technology, for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\nWe may in the future seek to pursue additional clinical trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of Fovista in wet AMD as well as other ophthalmic conditions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista consists of three separate Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $24.8 million, $13.0 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $49.8 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.6 years. We expect our share-based compensation for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, of which, $50.0 million was received in October 2014 and $50.0 million was received in April 2015. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million under one of our license agreements. We are entitled to certain additional future payments from Novartis based on the continued clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of Fovista. See \"Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\" below for further information.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura;\n\u2022 OPH1005 Fovista Anti-Fibrosis Study. During the third quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), to study subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in May 2015 with a total of 101 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial are followed over a 24-month period.\nWe used a portion of the proceeds that we initially received under the Novo Agreement to repay in full an aggregate of $14.4 million of outstanding principal, interest and fees under our venture debt facility and are using the remaining proceeds primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for Fovista and for general corporate expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $10.6 million, compared to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $3.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $2.7 million, an increase of $1.4 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for pre-launch commercialization activities, professional services and consulting fees of $2.0 million.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista;\nleast the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and seek marketing approval for Fovista or Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $391.9 million. We also had $368.9 million in total liabilities, $338.1 million of which related to the Novo Agreement and deferred revenue associated with the Novartis Agreement.\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\nIncome Taxes\nfor the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials, are evaluating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The third trial, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, is evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our development strategy for Fovista is to be agnostic with respect to the choice of the anti-VEGF drug administered in combination with Fovista.\nIn addition to our ongoing Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, we have initiated additional clinical trials to evaluate the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients. We refer to these trials collectively as the Fovista Expansion Studies. They include:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at\nclinical and commercial requirements for the bulk API for Fovista for use in-licensed products in the Novartis Territory. We have agreed not to commercialize any product comprising Fovista or any other anti-PDGF product in the ophthalmic field in the Novartis Territory.\n\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, net revenue received from commercial sales of Fovista or Zimura, after milestone payments and royalty payments that we will be obligated to make;\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenues from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments, research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The terms of this agreement and other potential collaboration or commercialization agreements we may enter into generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical, clinical or commercial material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; payments for manufactured material; and royalties on future product sales.\nOctober 2015 with a total of 64 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial followed over an 18-month period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 the timing, scope and cost of commercialization activities for Fovista or Zimura if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for either product candidate, including the costs and timing of expanding our outsourced manufacturing activities, including activities to build up our commercial drug supply and to enable and qualify second source suppliers, expanding our commercial operations and establishing product sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on all sales of Fovista products.\nWe do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista;\nand a $6.3 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nWe have retained control over the design and execution of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis's responsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials and ongoing Phase 2 trials and future Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in the Novartis Territory following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $111.1 million and related primarily to the receipt of $250.0 million in connection with the Novartis Agreement. Offsetting these cash receipts was a $19.8 million milestone payment to a third party in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, and cash used to fund our efforts to advance our Fovista Phase 3 program, including increased spending on clinical trial costs and manufacturing activity for Fovista.\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone under the Novartis Agreement, or\nIn November 2015, we were informed by Novartis that Genentech, Inc., a Roche wholly-owned subsidiary, elected to exercise its option to participate in the financial arrangements relating to Novartis' rights under the Novartis Agreement. Roche's option originated from a pre-existing agreement between Roche and Novartis. The ex-U.S. commercialization agreement between Ophthotech and Novartis and its financial terms remained unchanged as a result of the exercise of the opt-in right. We continue to retain sole rights to Fovista in the United States.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. See \"Risk Factors.\" This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research\nOverview\nIn May 2014, we entered into a Clinical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our clinical requirements in specified jurisdictions of Fovista API. The clinical supply agreement has an initial five-year term, which\nThe Novo Agreement requires the establishment by Novo A/S and us of a joint oversight committee in relation to the development of Fovista in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to have a representative on our board of directors. The Novo Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain covenants relating to the operation of our business, including covenants requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue our development of Fovista, to file, prosecute and maintain certain patent rights and, in our reasonable judgment, to pursue claims of infringement of our intellectual property rights. The Novo Agreement also places certain restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to grant security interests in our intellectual property to third parties, to sell, transfer or out-license intellectual property, or to grant others rights to receive royalties on sales of Fovista and certain other products. We reimbursed Novo A/S for specified legal and other expenses and are required to provide Novo A/S with certain continuing information rights. We have agreed to indemnify Novo A/S and its representatives with respect to certain matters, including with respect to any third-party infringement or product liability claims relating to our products. Our obligations under the Novo agreement are secured by a lien on certain of our intellectual property and other rights related to Fovista and other anti-PDGF products we may develop.\nInterest Income\nClinical API Supply Agreement\nFovista Phase 3 Clinical Program\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we allocated share-based compensation as follows:\nIn addition, in the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Expenditures to CROs and CMOs represent significant costs in clinical development. Subject to required notice periods and our obligations under binding purchase orders, we can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and even long-term commitments of cash.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners.\nInterest Income\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may need or may seek to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of assets, including intellectual property rights, as collateral to secure our obligations under the Novo Agreement may limit our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the potential remaining enrollment-based $30.0 million milestone payment under the Novartis Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned through the end of 2017.\nOur key objective and plan is to make Fovista commercially available to physicians to treat their patients with wet AMD as quickly as possible, subject to a favorable data outcome from the Phase 3 clinical program. We are continuing to explore various regulatory filing options. We plan to initially submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis.\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $33.4 million, an increase of $19.2 million compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $4.6 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $7.0 million increase to personnel costs. These increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, as well as the hiring of additional management and corporate staffing, costs related to an executive retirement and other one-time post-employment costs. Also contributing to the increase were increased professional services and consulting fees, infrastructure costs, insurance costs and travel costs.\nResults of Operations\nOur product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are in clinical development. We expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program. We expect our expenses to increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. For Fovista, our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, is responsible for these commercialization expenses outside the United States. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, and Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. For example, in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, we made a milestone payment of $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics in June 2014. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated, a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. We plan to enroll approximately 300 patients in the initial stage of the trial. During this stage, patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive monthly injections of 1.0 mg of Zimura per eye, monthly injections of 2.0 mg of Zimura per eye or monthly sham injections as the control arm. At month 18, we plan to conduct an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Zimura compared to sham. Upon review of this interim analysis, a determination will be made whether to continue the trial and whether to expand the trial by enrolling additional patients. Patients in the trial will receive monthly injections for 24 months.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nLicensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we achieved in September 2014 and received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we achieved in March 2015 and received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis also is obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on sales of Fovista products.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 Under a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, for specified pegylation reagents used to manufacture Fovista, we are obligated to make future payments to Nektar of up to an aggregate of $6.5 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones, and an additional payment of $3.0 million if we achieve a specified commercial milestone with respect to Fovista. We are obligated to pay Nektar tiered royalties at low to mid-single-digit percentages of net sales of any licensed product we successfully commercialize, with the royalty percentage determined by our level of licensed product sales, the extent of patent coverage for the licensed product and whether we have granted a third party commercialization rights to the licensed product. In June 2014, we paid Nektar $19.8 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement.\n\u2022 clinical trial results;\nFinancing Agreement with Novo A/S\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense.\nWe are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016, with initial, top-line data from this trial to be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates. This trial is investigating Fovista in combination with either Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our Phase 2b trial utilized Lucentis as the only anti-VEGF drug because Eylea was not yet approved and Avastin's non-inferiority status compared to Lucentis was not yet established at the time the Phase 2b clinical trial commenced. Therefore, in order to gain more experience with Fovista when administered in combination with Eylea or Avastin prior to starting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial started later (May 2014) than the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials (August 2013). This time period of approximately nine months allowed us to perform initial preclinical and clinical assessments and ensure compatibility of Eylea or Avastin when administered in combination with Fovista.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Using the relative selling price method, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we allocated $38.1 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation.\nCash Flows\n\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenue from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments and research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of certain milestone and other payments, if any, that we may receive from Novartis and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until the end of 2017 at the earliest. If we fail to complete the development of Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates we may develop, in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\noperations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding under our royalty purchase and sale agreement with Novo A/S, which we refer to as the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. We received net proceeds from our initial public offering of $175.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on public offering of $55.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We have received $125.0 million of funding under the Novo Agreement, which constitutes the full amount of funding under that agreement. We also received an upfront payment of $200.0 million from Novartis upon the execution of the Novartis Agreement and enrollment-based milestone payments of $50.0 million in October 2014 and $50.0 million in April 2015.\nThe royalty payment period begins on the commercial launch of Fovista and ends, on a country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of the twelfth anniversary of the commercial launch of Fovista, the expiration of certain patent rights covering Fovista, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Fovista, in each applicable country. Royalty payments will be payable quarterly in arrears during the royalty period. Our obligations under the Novo Agreement may also apply to certain other anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, products we may develop.\nIn addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, we may be required, under various agreements, to pay royalties and make milestone payments. In addition to the Novo Agreement, these agreements include the following:\n\u2022 expand our outsourced manufacturing activities and establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any product candidates;\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities and as a result of increased personnel, including management personnel to support our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, expanded infrastructure, increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company and increased insurance premiums, among other factors.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) for the treatment of wet AMD.\nWe expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase substantially compared to prior periods and for the foreseeable future for the reasons described below under \"-Funding Requirements\".\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, or $100.0 million in aggregate, under the Novartis Agreement. We recognized revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of the Fovista Expansion Studies to further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista in wet AMD when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet need;\n\u2022 OPH1006 Fovista Treatment Burden Reduction Study. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) to investigate the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in\nseparate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\n\nAt the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe anticipate that we will incur significant research and development expenses in connection with conducting our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and, if such trials are successful, seeking marketing approval for Fovista. We also expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through our Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially, in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as a result of the pursuit of our Zimura development programs. We expect these research and development expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. In addition, we expect that we will incur significant expenses related to manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. Our most advanced product candidate is Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib), which is in Phase 3 clinical development for use in combination with anti-VEGF drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. We have completed one Phase 1 and one Phase 2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab), have completed patient enrollment for two Phase 3 clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis and expect to complete enrollment in a third Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) or Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab) in 2016. We have completed enrollment in two additional Phase 2a clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), one of which is studying the potential of Fovista to reduce subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients and the other of which is investigating the optimized regimen of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, as well as the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We are also developing our product candidate Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol) as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. We are also investigating the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option for a license.\nManufacturing and Supply Agreements with Agilent Technologies, Inc.\nWe also have letter agreements with certain employees that require the funding of a specific level of payments, if certain events, such as a termination of employment in connection with a change in control or termination of employment by the employee for good reason or by us without cause, occur. For a description of these obligations, see our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, as filed with the SEC on April 30, 2015.\n\u2022 the scope, progress and results of our preclinical studies, formulation development and clinical development plans for tivozanib;\n\u2022 Under an option agreement with AVEO relating to tivozanib, we will be obligated to make milestone payments of $2.0 million upon the submission of an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA and $6.0 million upon the earlier of demonstration of proof of concept in humans and a specified date in January 2017, subject to any exercise by us of our right to terminate the option agreement.\nresponsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in the Phase 3 trials already initiated and in other Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in the Novartis Territory initiated following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\n\u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $247.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities totaling $662.0 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $411.6 million and capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our office facilities in New York, New York and the relocation to a new office facility in Princeton, New Jersey. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $427.8 million, which related primarily to the purchase of marketable securities totaling $597.8 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities of $171.6 million.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\n\u2022 continue to develop tivozanib for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\nis subject to automatic renewal absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the clinical supply agreement. The clinical supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis with the price reduced as the volume ordered increases. We may terminate the clinical supply agreement or any statement of work thereunder upon 12 months prior written notice to Agilent and Agilent may terminate the clinical supply agreement if we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of API for Fovista. Each party also has the right to terminate the clinical supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The clinical supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nand Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made.\nOverview of Funding History and Requirements\nWe aggregate our milestones into three categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, and (iii) commercial milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase or when a contractually specified clinical trial enrollment target is attained. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission of an application for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis has also granted us options, subject to specified limitations, and to the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products developed by Novartis. We and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products that we or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. We have agreed to exclusively supply Novartis, and Novartis has agreed to exclusively purchase from us, its\nAdequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\u2022 OPH1007 Fovista in Combination with Avastin Discontinuous Regimen Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with Avastin during the maintenance phase of wet AMD treatment compared to a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of Avastin monotherapy.\nNovartis Agreement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our expected tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $36.5 million, which primarily related to taxable income that resulted from payments we received under the Novartis Agreement and the Novo Agreement in 2014.\nFovista Expansion Studies\nMoreover, our current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trials, based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista, process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and potentially seek marketing approval for Fovista and Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $78.5 million and relates primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista expansion studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses. These expenditures were offset by a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone payment we received in connection with the Novartis Agreement in April 2015.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nWe expect that our expenses will further increase if and as we:\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nCurrently, we have the following ongoing clinical trials for Zimura:\nSources of Liquidity\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from any anti-PDGF aptamer, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $14.0 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to Fovista, up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and, for each other anti-PDGF aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, up to an aggregate of approximately $18.8 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our commercial requirements in all jurisdictions of Fovista API. The commercial supply agreement has an initial term that runs for seven years from the date of our first commercial sale of Fovista, and which is subject to one two-year automatic renewal period, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The commercial supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of Fovista API ordered increases. We may cancel any purchase order under the commercial supply agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the commercial supply agreement with no financial penalty in the event that we cannot commercialize Fovista due to regulatory or other medical, scientific or legal reasons. Agilent may terminate the commercial supply agreement in the event that we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of Fovista API. Each party also has the right to terminate the commercial supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The commercial supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, commercial and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\n\u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\nWe did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe were incorporated and commenced active operations in 2007. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring rights to product candidates, business planning, raising capital and developing Fovista and Zimura. We acquired our rights to Fovista from (OSI) Eyetech, Inc., or Eyetech, in July 2007. The acquisition included an assignment of license rights and obligations under an agreement with Archemix Corp. We have licensed rights to our product candidate Zimura from Archemix Corp. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $405.5 million. Our net loss was $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in 2016 and potentially 2017. We have not generated any revenues from product sales and have financed our\nThere was no other loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to other loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Amounts recorded as other loss were due to the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability recorded in the first half of 2013. Upon completion of our initial public offering on September 30, 2013, the preferred stock warrants were converted to common stock warrants and are now treated as permanent equity.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program, as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp. and Nektar Therapeutics, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations. Furthermore, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur costs associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our facilities. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Funding Requirements\" for a discussion of factors affecting our future capital requirements.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews of Fovista and Zimura;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development and/or clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 undertake additional clinical development of Fovista, if it is approved, in support of our efforts to broaden the label for Fovista;\nalso are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals a royalty at a low single-digit percentage of net sales of any covered anti-PDGF product we successfully commercialize.\n\nWe completed patient enrollment in one of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trial in November 2015. The Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials are investigating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy and are identical with respect to the trial design in the first year. Therefore, the databases from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials will be locked and analyzed together, which will allow for the pooled analysis of certain relevant endpoints in accordance with the statistical analysis plan. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nNovartis has agreed to specified limitations on its ability to in-license, acquire or commercialize any anti-PDGF product that does not contain Fovista, which we refer to as an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product, in the Novartis Territory and, to the extent Novartis develops, in-licenses or acquires such a product, to make such product available to us in the United States under specified option conditions. If we exercise our option, we will be obligated to make certain payments to Novartis, including specified milestone and royalty payments. The amounts of such payments will vary based on the product's stage of clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement, convert Novartis's exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will, subject to specified limitations, be required to pay to us, certain payments based on achievement, with respect to such product, of the milestones that would have otherwise applied to licensed products under the Novartis Agreement.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nRevenues from clinical and development and regulatory milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. With regards to the Novartis Agreement, we have concluded that the clinical and development milestones and certain reimbursement approval milestones are not substantive and that the marketing approval milestones are substantive. Milestone payments received that are not considered substantive are included in the allocable arrangement consideration and are recognized as revenue in proportion to the relative-selling price allocation established at the inception of the arrangement. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from anti-C5 aptamers, for each anti-C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, and up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double-digit percentage of specified non-royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under this license agreement. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\nRevenue\n\u2022 Zimura PCV Study. In late 2014, we commenced a very small, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial investigating Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. Our initial, preliminary analysis of the data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $41.3 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $38.4 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities.\n\u2022 our ability, together with any commercialization partner's ability, to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate we may develop could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of Fovista or any other product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nThe Novartis Agreement, unless earlier terminated by Novartis or us, will expire upon the expiration of Novartis's obligation to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed products. Novartis and we each may terminate the Novartis Agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period, if the other party experiences any specified insolvency event, if the other party challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by the terminating party, or if the parties are prevented in any manner that materially adversely affects the progression of the development or commercialization of licensed products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions. Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time without cause, or within a specified period after a change in control of us, as defined in the Novartis Agreement, or for specified safety reasons, effective at the end of a specified period following Novartis's written notice to us of Novartis's election to terminate the agreement. We may also terminate the agreement if Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an alternative anti-PDGF product in the Novartis Territory as more fully described below. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement because specified governmental actions prevent the parties from materially progressing the development or commercialization of licensed products as described above, we will be required to pay a substantial termination fee. Following any termination, all rights to Fovista that we granted to Novartis, including, without limitation, the right to commercialize standalone Fovista products in the Novartis Territory, will revert to us, Novartis will perform specified activities in connection with transitioning to us the rights and responsibilities for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of the standalone Fovista product for countries in the Novartis Territory, and the parties will cooperate on an orderly wind down of development and commercialization activities for other licensed products in the Novartis Territory.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.3 million, of which $38.4 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of Fovista, Zimura or any other products that we are able to successfully develop, which, depending on the product, may not be available for several years, if at all. In addition, if approved, Fovista or Zimura or any product that we acquire or in-license may not achieve commercial success. If that is the case, we may need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $145.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of proceeds of $55.4 million from our follow-on public offering in February 2014, and proceeds of $83.3 million from our royalty agreement with Novo A/S in January 2014.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\n(1)Operating lease obligations reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with leases for our office space.\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to, and develop, complimentary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technologies; and\n(2)Purchase obligations represent our commitments under purchase orders, including those made under our clinical and commercial supply agreements with Agilent.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\nIn May 2013, we entered into the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which we had the ability to obtain financing in three tranches in an amount of up to $125.0 million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage on worldwide sales of Fovista, with the royalty percentage determined by the amount of funding provided by Novo A/S. The three tranches of financing, in which Novo A/S purchased three low single-digit royalty interests and paid us $125.0 million in the aggregate, closed in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\n\u2022 the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies;\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (\"TPE\") of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We use BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our BESP, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\namounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nFunding Requirements\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.2 million compared to net interest expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a result of a significant increase in our investment portfolio average balances during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The amounts recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to interest expense associated with our venture debt facility that we entered into in June 2012. The debt facility was paid off in May 2013 and as such, there was no corresponding interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million compared to interest income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.", "item_7_text": "We have retained control over the design and execution of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis's\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nOther Loss\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel and expand our facilities.\n\u2022 conduct additional clinical trials of Zimura that may be required by regulatory authorities, including a second Phase 3 clinical trial for GA, to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully file, prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights, together with associated expenses.\nCollaboration Revenue\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical testing and manufacturing of Fovista and Zimura, as well as costs associated with the preclinical development of other product candidates and formulations. Our research and development expenses consist of:\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates that we may develop. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds other than the Novartis Agreement. The remaining potential milestone payments under the Novartis Agreement are subject to our achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial events related to Fovista, none of which can be assured.\nZimura Clinical Development\n\nRoyalty Purchase Liability\nFinancial Operations Overview\nThe agreement contains standstill provisions pursuant to which Novartis agrees to certain restrictions relating to our voting securities until marketing approval for a standalone Fovista product is granted in either the United States or the European Union. The agreement contains indemnification and dispute resolution provisions that are customary for agreements of its kind.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $391.9 million and no debt. We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTo date, the large majority of our research and development work has been related to Fovista and Zimura. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the development of and seek marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura and, possibly, other product candidates.\n$100.0 million in the aggregate. We recognized collaboration revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nShare-Based Compensation\nOur research and development expenses were $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $55.2 million compared to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $25.3 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the initiation of certain Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials. The increase was also due to a higher milestone payment of $19.8 million that we made in June 2014 in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, as compared to $3.5 million in milestone payments we made in 2013 in connection with the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trials in August 2013. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $4.4 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $5.5 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $4.7 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nIn 2014, we received $83.3 million from Novo A/S under the Novo Agreement, which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. Also in 2014, we received $200.0 million from Novartis upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, a portion of which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. In addition, we received a milestone payment of $50.0 million in 2014 from Novartis which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. As a result of these payments, and after taking into account the utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards and utilization of our research and development tax credits, we reported taxable income for tax purposes in 2014. We made income tax payments of $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. We incurred tax losses for 2015 and as such, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets has been released, where appropriate. See Note 9 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nCollaboration Revenue\nThe provision for income taxes recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $36.5 million. This primarily relates to the payments we received from Novartis and Novo A/S in 2014, a significant portion of which contributed to an increase in taxable income for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record a provision for income taxes due to our significant operating losses.\nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the success of our development and commercialization of our product candidates and whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. For example, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials, if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities or corporate staffing. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any delays in completing the clinical trials of Fovista or Zimura, or the development of any of other product candidates that we may develop, our expenses could increase. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations prior than expected.\n\u2022 OPH1008 Fovista Imaging Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to investigate the role of multi-modal imaging in assessing anatomic responses to various wet AMD treatment regimens of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin).\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel;\n\u2022 Under our divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC., or OSI Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, for rights to particular anti-PDGF aptamers, including Fovista, we are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals future one-time payments of $12.0 million in the aggregate upon marketing approval in the United States and the European Union of a covered anti-PDGF product. We\nSee the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section on page 149 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our current and future financial resources and our expectations regarding our research and development expenses and funding requirements.\n(3)This table does not include (a) any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty, (b) any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known, (c) anticipated expenditures under supply agreements for periods for which we are not yet bound under binding purchase orders, (d) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business that are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above and (e) our royalty purchase liability of $125.0 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the fact that the royalty payment period, if any, is not known.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Zimura clinical programs, including our Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study and our Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study, as well as any additional clinical trials (including a potential second Phase 3 trial for GA) required by regulatory authorities for us to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\nWhen management believes the license to our intellectual property and products has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. When management believes such a license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nCommercial API Supply Agreement\nOur research and development expenses were $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $42.6 million compared to $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $19.8 million milestone payment we made in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which represented a significant portion of our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $40.6 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $3.3 million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing and clinical trial costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $9.0 million increase to share-based compensation costs\n\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under the Novo Agreement have been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Because there is a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our balance sheet. As we make royalty payments to Novo A/S in accordance with the Novo Agreement, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such\nNovartis has agreed to pay our manufacturing costs plus a specified percentage margin for commercial supplies of the bulk API for Fovista that we supply to Novartis. If we or Novartis exercise our or its respective rights to obtain access to study data from clinical trials conducted by the other party, the party exercising the option will be obligated to pay the other party's associated past development costs and share equally with such other party any future associated development costs. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize any co-formulated Fovista product in the United States, we will be obligated to pay a specified percentage of Novartis's associated past development costs and share with Novartis any future associated development costs. Novartis and we will also need to negotiate and agree on financial and other terms that would apply to such rights. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop and commercialize a pre-filled syringe product in the United States, we will be obligated to either enter into a supply agreement with Novartis under which we will pay Novartis its manufacturing cost plus a specified percentage margin for supplies of Fovista products in pre-filled syringes that Novartis supplies to us, or obtain supplies of products in pre-filled syringes from a third party manufacturer and pay Novartis a low single-digit percentage of our net sales of such products.\n\u2022 in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue research and development of, other complementary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technology, for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\nWe may in the future seek to pursue additional clinical trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of Fovista in wet AMD as well as other ophthalmic conditions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista consists of three separate Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $24.8 million, $13.0 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $49.8 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.6 years. We expect our share-based compensation for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, of which, $50.0 million was received in October 2014 and $50.0 million was received in April 2015. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million under one of our license agreements. We are entitled to certain additional future payments from Novartis based on the continued clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of Fovista. See \"Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\" below for further information.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura;\n\u2022 OPH1005 Fovista Anti-Fibrosis Study. During the third quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), to study subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in May 2015 with a total of 101 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial are followed over a 24-month period.\nWe used a portion of the proceeds that we initially received under the Novo Agreement to repay in full an aggregate of $14.4 million of outstanding principal, interest and fees under our venture debt facility and are using the remaining proceeds primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for Fovista and for general corporate expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $10.6 million, compared to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $3.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $2.7 million, an increase of $1.4 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for pre-launch commercialization activities, professional services and consulting fees of $2.0 million.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista;\nleast the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and seek marketing approval for Fovista or Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $391.9 million. We also had $368.9 million in total liabilities, $338.1 million of which related to the Novo Agreement and deferred revenue associated with the Novartis Agreement.\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\nIncome Taxes\nfor the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials, are evaluating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The third trial, referred to as the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, is evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our development strategy for Fovista is to be agnostic with respect to the choice of the anti-VEGF drug administered in combination with Fovista.\nIn addition to our ongoing Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, we have initiated additional clinical trials to evaluate the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients. We refer to these trials collectively as the Fovista Expansion Studies. They include:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at\nclinical and commercial requirements for the bulk API for Fovista for use in-licensed products in the Novartis Territory. We have agreed not to commercialize any product comprising Fovista or any other anti-PDGF product in the ophthalmic field in the Novartis Territory.\n\n\u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approval, net revenue received from commercial sales of Fovista or Zimura, after milestone payments and royalty payments that we will be obligated to make;\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenues from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments, research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The terms of this agreement and other potential collaboration or commercialization agreements we may enter into generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical, clinical or commercial material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; payments for manufactured material; and royalties on future product sales.\nOctober 2015 with a total of 64 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial followed over an 18-month period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 the timing, scope and cost of commercialization activities for Fovista or Zimura if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for either product candidate, including the costs and timing of expanding our outsourced manufacturing activities, including activities to build up our commercial drug supply and to enable and qualify second source suppliers, expanding our commercial operations and establishing product sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on all sales of Fovista products.\nWe do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\n\u2022 the costs and timing of manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista;\nand a $6.3 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.\nWe have retained control over the design and execution of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis's responsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials and ongoing Phase 2 trials and future Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in the Novartis Territory following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $111.1 million and related primarily to the receipt of $250.0 million in connection with the Novartis Agreement. Offsetting these cash receipts was a $19.8 million milestone payment to a third party in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, and cash used to fund our efforts to advance our Fovista Phase 3 program, including increased spending on clinical trial costs and manufacturing activity for Fovista.\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone under the Novartis Agreement, or\nIn November 2015, we were informed by Novartis that Genentech, Inc., a Roche wholly-owned subsidiary, elected to exercise its option to participate in the financial arrangements relating to Novartis' rights under the Novartis Agreement. Roche's option originated from a pre-existing agreement between Roche and Novartis. The ex-U.S. commercialization agreement between Ophthotech and Novartis and its financial terms remained unchanged as a result of the exercise of the opt-in right. We continue to retain sole rights to Fovista in the United States.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. See \"Risk Factors.\" This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research\nOverview\nIn May 2014, we entered into a Clinical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our clinical requirements in specified jurisdictions of Fovista API. The clinical supply agreement has an initial five-year term, which\nThe Novo Agreement requires the establishment by Novo A/S and us of a joint oversight committee in relation to the development of Fovista in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to have a representative on our board of directors. The Novo Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain covenants relating to the operation of our business, including covenants requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue our development of Fovista, to file, prosecute and maintain certain patent rights and, in our reasonable judgment, to pursue claims of infringement of our intellectual property rights. The Novo Agreement also places certain restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to grant security interests in our intellectual property to third parties, to sell, transfer or out-license intellectual property, or to grant others rights to receive royalties on sales of Fovista and certain other products. We reimbursed Novo A/S for specified legal and other expenses and are required to provide Novo A/S with certain continuing information rights. We have agreed to indemnify Novo A/S and its representatives with respect to certain matters, including with respect to any third-party infringement or product liability claims relating to our products. Our obligations under the Novo agreement are secured by a lien on certain of our intellectual property and other rights related to Fovista and other anti-PDGF products we may develop.\nInterest Income\nClinical API Supply Agreement\nFovista Phase 3 Clinical Program\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we allocated share-based compensation as follows:\nIn addition, in the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Expenditures to CROs and CMOs represent significant costs in clinical development. Subject to required notice periods and our obligations under binding purchase orders, we can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and even long-term commitments of cash.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners.\nInterest Income\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may need or may seek to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of assets, including intellectual property rights, as collateral to secure our obligations under the Novo Agreement may limit our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the potential remaining enrollment-based $30.0 million milestone payment under the Novartis Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned through the end of 2017.\nOur key objective and plan is to make Fovista commercially available to physicians to treat their patients with wet AMD as quickly as possible, subject to a favorable data outcome from the Phase 3 clinical program. We are continuing to explore various regulatory filing options. We plan to initially submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis.\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $33.4 million, an increase of $19.2 million compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $4.6 million increase to share-based compensation costs and a $7.0 million increase to personnel costs. These increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company infrastructure, as well as the hiring of additional management and corporate staffing, costs related to an executive retirement and other one-time post-employment costs. Also contributing to the increase were increased professional services and consulting fees, infrastructure costs, insurance costs and travel costs.\nResults of Operations\nOur product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are in clinical development. We expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program. We expect our expenses to increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. For Fovista, our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, is responsible for these commercialization expenses outside the United States. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, and Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. For example, in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, we made a milestone payment of $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics in June 2014. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated, a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. We plan to enroll approximately 300 patients in the initial stage of the trial. During this stage, patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive monthly injections of 1.0 mg of Zimura per eye, monthly injections of 2.0 mg of Zimura per eye or monthly sham injections as the control arm. At month 18, we plan to conduct an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Zimura compared to sham. Upon review of this interim analysis, a determination will be made whether to continue the trial and whether to expand the trial by enrolling additional patients. Patients in the trial will receive monthly injections for 24 months.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nLicensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $130.0 million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0 million of which we achieved in September 2014 and received in October 2014 and $50.0 million of which we achieved in March 2015 and received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis also is obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on sales of Fovista products.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u2022 Under a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, for specified pegylation reagents used to manufacture Fovista, we are obligated to make future payments to Nektar of up to an aggregate of $6.5 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones, and an additional payment of $3.0 million if we achieve a specified commercial milestone with respect to Fovista. We are obligated to pay Nektar tiered royalties at low to mid-single-digit percentages of net sales of any licensed product we successfully commercialize, with the royalty percentage determined by our level of licensed product sales, the extent of patent coverage for the licensed product and whether we have granted a third party commercialization rights to the licensed product. In June 2014, we paid Nektar $19.8 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement.\n\u2022 clinical trial results;\nFinancing Agreement with Novo A/S\n\u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense.\nWe are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016, with initial, top-line data from this trial to be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates. This trial is investigating Fovista in combination with either Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our Phase 2b trial utilized Lucentis as the only anti-VEGF drug because Eylea was not yet approved and Avastin's non-inferiority status compared to Lucentis was not yet established at the time the Phase 2b clinical trial commenced. Therefore, in order to gain more experience with Fovista when administered in combination with Eylea or Avastin prior to starting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trial started later (May 2014) than the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials (August 2013). This time period of approximately nine months allowed us to perform initial preclinical and clinical assessments and ensure compatibility of Eylea or Avastin when administered in combination with Fovista.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Using the relative selling price method, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we allocated $38.1 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation.\nCash Flows\n\n\u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\nIn the future, we may generate additional revenue from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments and research and development activity-related payments, payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of certain milestone and other payments, if any, that we may receive from Novartis and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until the end of 2017 at the earliest. If we fail to complete the development of Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates we may develop, in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\noperations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding under our royalty purchase and sale agreement with Novo A/S, which we refer to as the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. We received net proceeds from our initial public offering of $175.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on public offering of $55.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We have received $125.0 million of funding under the Novo Agreement, which constitutes the full amount of funding under that agreement. We also received an upfront payment of $200.0 million from Novartis upon the execution of the Novartis Agreement and enrollment-based milestone payments of $50.0 million in October 2014 and $50.0 million in April 2015.\nThe royalty payment period begins on the commercial launch of Fovista and ends, on a country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of the twelfth anniversary of the commercial launch of Fovista, the expiration of certain patent rights covering Fovista, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Fovista, in each applicable country. Royalty payments will be payable quarterly in arrears during the royalty period. Our obligations under the Novo Agreement may also apply to certain other anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, products we may develop.\nIn addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, we may be required, under various agreements, to pay royalties and make milestone payments. In addition to the Novo Agreement, these agreements include the following:\n\u2022 expand our outsourced manufacturing activities and establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any product candidates;\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to support increases in our research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities and as a result of increased personnel, including management personnel to support our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, expanded infrastructure, increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company and increased insurance premiums, among other factors.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\n\u2022 Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) for the treatment of wet AMD.\nWe expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase substantially compared to prior periods and for the foreseeable future for the reasons described below under \"-Funding Requirements\".\nPrior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, or $100.0 million in aggregate, under the Novartis Agreement. We recognized revenue of approximately $51.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0 million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\n\u2022 the scope, progress, costs and results of the Fovista Expansion Studies to further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista in wet AMD when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet need;\n\u2022 OPH1006 Fovista Treatment Burden Reduction Study. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) to investigate the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in\nseparate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\n\nAt the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe anticipate that we will incur significant research and development expenses in connection with conducting our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and, if such trials are successful, seeking marketing approval for Fovista. We also expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through our Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially, in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as a result of the pursuit of our Zimura development programs. We expect these research and development expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. In addition, we expect that we will incur significant expenses related to manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. Our most advanced product candidate is Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib), which is in Phase 3 clinical development for use in combination with anti-VEGF drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. We have completed one Phase 1 and one Phase 2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab), have completed patient enrollment for two Phase 3 clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis and expect to complete enrollment in a third Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) or Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab) in 2016. We have completed enrollment in two additional Phase 2a clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), one of which is studying the potential of Fovista to reduce subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients and the other of which is investigating the optimized regimen of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, as well as the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We are also developing our product candidate Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol) as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. We are also investigating the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option for a license.\nManufacturing and Supply Agreements with Agilent Technologies, Inc.\nWe also have letter agreements with certain employees that require the funding of a specific level of payments, if certain events, such as a termination of employment in connection with a change in control or termination of employment by the employee for good reason or by us without cause, occur. For a description of these obligations, see our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, as filed with the SEC on April 30, 2015.\n\u2022 the scope, progress and results of our preclinical studies, formulation development and clinical development plans for tivozanib;\n\u2022 Under an option agreement with AVEO relating to tivozanib, we will be obligated to make milestone payments of $2.0 million upon the submission of an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA and $6.0 million upon the earlier of demonstration of proof of concept in humans and a specified date in January 2017, subject to any exercise by us of our right to terminate the option agreement.\nresponsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in the Phase 3 trials already initiated and in other Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in the Novartis Territory initiated following the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.\n\u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $247.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities totaling $662.0 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $411.6 million and capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our office facilities in New York, New York and the relocation to a new office facility in Princeton, New Jersey. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $427.8 million, which related primarily to the purchase of marketable securities totaling $597.8 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities of $171.6 million.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.\n\u2022 continue to develop tivozanib for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases;\nis subject to automatic renewal absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the clinical supply agreement. The clinical supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis with the price reduced as the volume ordered increases. We may terminate the clinical supply agreement or any statement of work thereunder upon 12 months prior written notice to Agilent and Agilent may terminate the clinical supply agreement if we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of API for Fovista. Each party also has the right to terminate the clinical supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The clinical supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nand Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made.\nOverview of Funding History and Requirements\nWe aggregate our milestones into three categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, and (iii) commercial milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase or when a contractually specified clinical trial enrollment target is attained. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission of an application for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis has also granted us options, subject to specified limitations, and to the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products developed by Novartis. We and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products that we or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. We have agreed to exclusively supply Novartis, and Novartis has agreed to exclusively purchase from us, its\nAdequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\u2022 OPH1007 Fovista in Combination with Avastin Discontinuous Regimen Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with Avastin during the maintenance phase of wet AMD treatment compared to a discontinuous, bi-monthly regimen of Avastin monotherapy.\nNovartis Agreement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our expected tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $36.5 million, which primarily related to taxable income that resulted from payments we received under the Novartis Agreement and the Novo Agreement in 2014.\nFovista Expansion Studies\nMoreover, our current Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase 3 clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for the Fovista Phase 3 Eylea/Avastin Trials, based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista, process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and potentially seek marketing approval for Fovista and Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $78.5 million and relates primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista expansion studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses. These expenditures were offset by a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone payment we received in connection with the Novartis Agreement in April 2015.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nWe expect that our expenses will further increase if and as we:\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nCurrently, we have the following ongoing clinical trials for Zimura:\nSources of Liquidity\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from any anti-PDGF aptamer, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $14.0 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to Fovista, up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and, for each other anti-PDGF aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, up to an aggregate of approximately $18.8 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nIn September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our commercial requirements in all jurisdictions of Fovista API. The commercial supply agreement has an initial term that runs for seven years from the date of our first commercial sale of Fovista, and which is subject to one two-year automatic renewal period, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The commercial supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of Fovista API ordered increases. We may cancel any purchase order under the commercial supply agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the commercial supply agreement with no financial penalty in the event that we cannot commercialize Fovista due to regulatory or other medical, scientific or legal reasons. Agilent may terminate the commercial supply agreement in the event that we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of Fovista API. Each party also has the right to terminate the commercial supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The commercial supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, commercial and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\n\u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\nWe did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe were incorporated and commenced active operations in 2007. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring rights to product candidates, business planning, raising capital and developing Fovista and Zimura. We acquired our rights to Fovista from (OSI) Eyetech, Inc., or Eyetech, in July 2007. The acquisition included an assignment of license rights and obligations under an agreement with Archemix Corp. We have licensed rights to our product candidate Zimura from Archemix Corp. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $405.5 million. Our net loss was $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in 2016 and potentially 2017. We have not generated any revenues from product sales and have financed our\nThere was no other loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to other loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Amounts recorded as other loss were due to the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability recorded in the first half of 2013. Upon completion of our initial public offering on September 30, 2013, the preferred stock warrants were converted to common stock warrants and are now treated as permanent equity.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase 3 clinical program, as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US, LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp. and Nektar Therapeutics, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations. Furthermore, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur costs associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our facilities. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Funding Requirements\" for a discussion of factors affecting our future capital requirements.\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews of Fovista and Zimura;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development and/or clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 undertake additional clinical development of Fovista, if it is approved, in support of our efforts to broaden the label for Fovista;\nalso are obligated to pay to OSI Pharmaceuticals a royalty at a low single-digit percentage of net sales of any covered anti-PDGF product we successfully commercialize.\n\nWe completed patient enrollment in one of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trial in November 2015. The Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials are investigating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy and are identical with respect to the trial design in the first year. Therefore, the databases from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials will be locked and analyzed together, which will allow for the pooled analysis of certain relevant endpoints in accordance with the statistical analysis plan. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase 3 Lucentis Trials to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nNovartis has agreed to specified limitations on its ability to in-license, acquire or commercialize any anti-PDGF product that does not contain Fovista, which we refer to as an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product, in the Novartis Territory and, to the extent Novartis develops, in-licenses or acquires such a product, to make such product available to us in the United States under specified option conditions. If we exercise our option, we will be obligated to make certain payments to Novartis, including specified milestone and royalty payments. The amounts of such payments will vary based on the product's stage of clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement, convert Novartis's exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will, subject to specified limitations, be required to pay to us, certain payments based on achievement, with respect to such product, of the milestones that would have otherwise applied to licensed products under the Novartis Agreement.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nRevenues from clinical and development and regulatory milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. With regards to the Novartis Agreement, we have concluded that the clinical and development milestones and certain reimbursement approval milestones are not substantive and that the marketing approval milestones are substantive. Milestone payments received that are not considered substantive are included in the allocable arrangement consideration and are recognized as revenue in proportion to the relative-selling price allocation established at the inception of the arrangement. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\u2022 Under a license agreement with Archemix with respect to pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from anti-C5 aptamers, for each anti-C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, and up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double-digit percentage of specified non-royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under this license agreement. No royalties are payable to Archemix under this license agreement.\nRevenue\n\u2022 Zimura PCV Study. In late 2014, we commenced a very small, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial investigating Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. Our initial, preliminary analysis of the data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $41.3 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $38.4 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities.\n\u2022 our ability, together with any commercialization partner's ability, to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate we may develop could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of Fovista or any other product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nThe Novartis Agreement, unless earlier terminated by Novartis or us, will expire upon the expiration of Novartis's obligation to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed products. Novartis and we each may terminate the Novartis Agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period, if the other party experiences any specified insolvency event, if the other party challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by the terminating party, or if the parties are prevented in any manner that materially adversely affects the progression of the development or commercialization of licensed products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions. Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time without cause, or within a specified period after a change in control of us, as defined in the Novartis Agreement, or for specified safety reasons, effective at the end of a specified period following Novartis's written notice to us of Novartis's election to terminate the agreement. We may also terminate the agreement if Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an alternative anti-PDGF product in the Novartis Territory as more fully described below. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement because specified governmental actions prevent the parties from materially progressing the development or commercialization of licensed products as described above, we will be required to pay a substantial termination fee. Following any termination, all rights to Fovista that we granted to Novartis, including, without limitation, the right to commercialize standalone Fovista products in the Novartis Territory, will revert to us, Novartis will perform specified activities in connection with transitioning to us the rights and responsibilities for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of the standalone Fovista product for countries in the Novartis Territory, and the parties will cooperate on an orderly wind down of development and commercialization activities for other licensed products in the Novartis Territory.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.3 million, of which $38.4 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $2.0 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $0.9 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of Fovista, Zimura or any other products that we are able to successfully develop, which, depending on the product, may not be available for several years, if at all. In addition, if approved, Fovista or Zimura or any product that we acquire or in-license may not achieve commercial success. If that is the case, we may need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $145.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of proceeds of $55.4 million from our follow-on public offering in February 2014, and proceeds of $83.3 million from our royalty agreement with Novo A/S in January 2014.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\n(1)Operating lease obligations reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with leases for our office space.\n\u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to, and develop, complimentary products, product candidates or technologies, including drug delivery technologies; and\n(2)Purchase obligations represent our commitments under purchase orders, including those made under our clinical and commercial supply agreements with Agilent.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\nIn May 2013, we entered into the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which we had the ability to obtain financing in three tranches in an amount of up to $125.0 million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage on worldwide sales of Fovista, with the royalty percentage determined by the amount of funding provided by Novo A/S. The three tranches of financing, in which Novo A/S purchased three low single-digit royalty interests and paid us $125.0 million in the aggregate, closed in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\n\u2022 the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies;\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (\"TPE\") of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We use BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our BESP, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\namounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nFunding Requirements\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.2 million compared to net interest expense of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2014 was a result of a significant increase in our investment portfolio average balances during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The amounts recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to interest expense associated with our venture debt facility that we entered into in June 2012. The debt facility was paid off in May 2013 and as such, there was no corresponding interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million compared to interest income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 17:

points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Ophthotech is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for back of the eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
