MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWhen reading the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this report. Unless noted otherwise, all references to FBL Financial Group, Inc. (we or the Company) include all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (Farm Bureau Life) and Greenfields Life Insurance Company.\nIn this discussion and analysis, we explain our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and where appropriate, factors that management believes may affect future performance, including:\n\u2022our revenues and expenses in the periods presented,\n\u2022changes in revenues and expenses between periods,\n\u2022sources of earnings and changes in stockholders' equity,\n\u2022impact of these items on our overall financial condition and\n\u2022expected sources and uses of cash.\nWe have organized our discussion and analysis as follows:\n\u2022First, we discuss our business and drivers of profitability.\n\u2022We then describe the business environment in which we operate including factors that affect operating results.\n\u2022We highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022We then review the results of operations beginning with an overview of the total Company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment.\n\u2022Finally, we discuss critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards. The critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult or complex judgment.\nMerger Agreement\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, Merger Agreement,\u201d on January 11, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by our board of directors, FBPCIC will acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares that are not currently owned or controlled by FBPCIC or IFBF, for $56.00 per Common Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain specified closing conditions, including approval by the Company's shareholders as described in Part I, Item 1, expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, clearance by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The obtaining of financing is not a condition to the obligations of FBPCIC or Merger Sub to effect the Merger.\nOverview and Profitability\nWe operate predominantly in the life insurance industry through our principal subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life. Farm Bureau Life markets individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts to Farm Bureau members and other individuals and businesses in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States through an exclusive agency force. Other subsidiaries provide external wealth management services as well as investment management and other support services to our affiliated insurance companies. In addition, we manage two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies.\nWe analyze operations by reviewing financial information regarding our primary products that are aggregated in Annuity and Life Insurance product segments. In addition, our Corporate and Other segment includes our wealth management business, various support operations, corporate capital and other product lines that are not currently underwritten by the Company. We analyze our segment results based on pre-tax adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of certain items that are included in pre-tax net income. Pre-tax adjusted operating income is the same basis used for segment reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We also analyze operations using adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis, which excludes the initial impact from tax law changes. Adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis is not a measure used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of performance. We have included a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure herein. See Note 13 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding how we define our segments and pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nWe also include within our analysis premiums collected,\u201d another measure that is not used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of agent productivity. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding this measure and its relationship to GAAP revenues.\nWe periodically revise key assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance in force acquired, deferred sales inducements, unearned revenue reserve for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products, as applicable, through an unlocking\u201d process. These assumptions typically consist of withdrawal and lapse rates, rider utilization, earned spreads and mortality with revisions based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. The impact of unlocking is recorded in the current period as an increase or decrease to amortization of the respective balances. While the unlocking process can take place at any time, as needs dictate, the process typically takes place during the third quarter. See the discussion that follows for further details of the unlocking impact on our results in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOur profitability is primarily a factor of:\n\u2022The volume of our life insurance and annuity business in force, which is driven by the level of our sales and the persistency of the business written.\n\u2022The amount of spread (excess of net investment income earned over interest credited) we earn on contract holders' general account balances.\n\u2022Our ability to price our life insurance products to earn acceptable margins over the cost of providing benefits and the expenses of acquiring and administering the products. Competitive conditions, mortality experience, persistency, benefit utilization, investment results and our ability to maintain expenses in accordance with pricing assumptions drive our margins on the life products. On many products, we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges.\n\u2022Our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns while providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and minimizing the risk of defaults or impairments of invested assets.\n\u2022Our ability to manage the level of our operating expenses.\n\u2022Actual experience and changes in assumptions for expected surrender and withdrawal rates, mortality and spreads used in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nOur profitability is also impacted by changes in accounting guidance that affect the timing of profit recognition. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for details on adopted and pending accounting pronouncements.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\nOur business generally benefits from moderate to strong economic expansion. Conversely, a lackluster economy characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, muted corporate earnings growth and lower business investment could adversely impact the demand for our products in the future. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims, lapses or surrenders of policies during such times. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the U.S. economy during 2020. Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 the United States experienced significant economic disruption as businesses closed and consumer access to goods and services became limited due to regulated or voluntary quarantine measures. As a result, the financial markets reacted negatively, impacting corporate liquidity and market interest rates. After the initial shock, the U.S. economy improved with the aid of significant economic stimulus measures, resulting in the stabilization of financial markets.\nThe following are key measures which partially illustrate the impact from COVID-19 on the economy:\n\u2022U.S. gross domestic product decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% during 2020, compared to an increase of 2.2% during 2019 based on estimates.\n\u2022U.S. unemployment increased to 6.7% at December 31, 2020 based on estimates, compared to 3.5% at December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note decreased to 0.93% at December 31, 2020 from 1.92% at December 31, 2019.\nFBL Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created several operational challenges during 2020. Our initial focus was to quickly transition to working at home, safeguarding employees and reducing the risk of business interruption. Social distancing impacted our sales process between our agents and client/members. The launch of our accelerated underwriting process during the third quarter 2020, led to some processing delays with a third-party provider, which the vendor attributed to be partially due to COVID-19. We took action to address the delays for our client/members and worked with the vendor to remediate the accelerated underwriting process.\nFinancial results\nWe believe COVID-19 and the impact it had on our economy contributed to the following financial results during 2020:\n\u2022As the economic downturn and lack of consumer mobility put strain on certain issuers, net realized capital losses and the change in allowance for credit losses totaled $16.3 million during 2020 compared to net realized capital gains including other-than-temporary impairment losses of $7.6 million during 2019. The majority of these losses were incurred during the first quarter 2020.\n\u2022We incurred death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, with COVID-19 reported as a cause of death totaling $11.2 million during 2020.\n\u2022We incurred a pre-tax unlocking charge of $6.7 million during 2020, driven largely by a $13.1 million pre-tax charge associated with an expectation of lower future investment portfolio interest rates.\n\u2022Collected annuity premium decreased to $182.3 million during 2020, compared to $252.0 million collected during 2019. These decreases were attributable to COVID-19 through fewer sales opportunities, decreased interest crediting rates and economic uncertainty.\nManagement took several actions to address these challenges.\n\u2022Expense management was a focus, which partially offset the pandemic's financial impact.\n\u2022We conducted tactical sales of investments to reduce exposure to certain industries impacted by the economic downturn.\n\u2022Product actions were taken to improve profitability.\nFinancial position\nLower fixed maturity interest rates driven by lower U.S. Treasury interest rates resulted in an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities during 2020. The increase in fair value of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, resulted in an increase in our book value per common share to $69.24 at December 31, 2020 from $60.12 at December 31, 2019.\nOur capital position remains strong, with Farm Bureau Life's company action level risk-based capital ratio was 528% at December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position remains strong with cash being generated by operations and financing activities. In addition, a significant portion of our liquid fixed maturity securities are in an unrealized gain position. See the Investments\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d discussions that follow.\nResults of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2020\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change over prior year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to FBL Financial Group, Inc. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial impact of the Tax Act (1) </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(617) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proposed acquisition transaction expenses (2) </td> <td>2,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains/losses on investments (3) </td> <td>12,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,813) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(312) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(161) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives (3) </td> <td>4,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,703) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(283) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(144) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income (4) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax adjusted operating income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity segment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life Insurance segment </td> <td>36,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other segment </td> <td>8,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax adjusted operating income </td> <td>106,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes on adjusted operating income </td> <td>(14,646) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,584) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,629) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income (4) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share -

See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\n(2)Amount represents the transaction expenses relating to FBL Financial Group's proposed merger transaction.\n(3)Amounts are net of adjustments, as applicable, to amortization of unearned revenue reserves and deferred acquisition costs, as well as changes in interest sensitive product reserves and income taxes attributable to these items.\n(4)Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of earnings, see Overview section above for additional information.\n(5)Average invested assets, including investments held as securities and indebtedness of related parties and cash equivalents, is the average of investment balances at the beginning of the reporting period and as of the end of each quarter throughout the reporting period. Average invested assets are used in the calculation of the annualized investment yield.\n(6)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n(7)Amounts represent the estimated effect of market performance of policyholder funds invested in the separate accounts on the value of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserve, net of tax.\n(8)Includes prepayment fee income and adjustments to the amortization of premium or discounts from changes in our payment speed assumptions on mortgage and other asset-backed securities.\nNet income in 2020, compared to 2019, was negatively impacted by changes in net realized gains/losses from investments, the change in fair value of derivatives and expenses incurred during 2020 related to the proposed Merger. Net income and adjusted operating income decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, primarily due to COVID-19, the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets. These decreases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by an increase in equity income and a reduction in other underwriting expenses and a benefit from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nNet income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to changes in net realized gains/losses from investments and changes in fair value of derivatives. Net income and adjusted operating income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs from the impact of market performance on our variable business and increased earnings from an increase in the volume of business in force. These increases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by increases in death benefits and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets.\nFootnotes applicable to the segment discussion that follows are as follows:\n(1)Premiums collected is a non-GAAP measure of sales production, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\n(2)Average invested assets, including applicable investments held as securities and indebtedness of related parties and cash equivalents, is the average of investment balances at the beginning of the reporting period and as of the end of each quarter throughout the reporting period. Average invested assets are used in the calculation of the annualized investment yield.\n(3)Includes prepayment fee income and adjustments to the amortization of premium or discounts from changes in our payment speed assumptions on mortgage and other asset-backed securities.\n(4)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n(5)Annualized average crediting rates consist of annualized interest credited and index credits applied to policyholders during the reporting period, along with amortization of call option costs and proceeds from sales or maturing call options associated with the call options that back our indexed products as a percentage of the simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning of the reporting period and end of the reporting period, adjusted for interest credited during the period. Annualized average crediting rates along with annualized average investment yields provides a view of spread margin earned on the underlying products.\n(6)Average aggregate individual annuity account value is a measure used to monitor business growth in our individual fixed and indexed annuity product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n(7)Individual annuity withdrawal rate represents withdrawal benefits incurred during the reporting period, excluding internal exchanges, as a percent of the simple average of related policy reserves at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The individual annuity withdrawal rate is a measure customer retention.\n(8)Average aggregate interest sensitive life account value is a measure used to monitor business growth in our universal life product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n(9)Life insurance lapse and surrender rate represents the face amount of policyholder lapses and surrenders, incurred during the reporting period, as a percent of the simple average of related insurance in force at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The life insurance lapse and surrender rate is a measure of customer retention.\n(10)Average aggregate interest sensitive account value is a measure used to monitor business volume of our variable universal life and variable annuity product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n(11)Amounts represent

other underwriting expenses, partially offset by lower spread income earned. Pre-tax adjusted operating income decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower spread income earned and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions.\nThe average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force decreased slightly in 2020, compared to 2019, as withdrawals and surrenders exceeded annuity premiums. The average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to continued sales and the crediting of interest. Growth in our indexed annuity business in force continues to drive increases in interest sensitive product charges. Premiums collected decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to decreased sales of our fixed rate deferred and indexed annuity products, as sales were negatively impacted by crediting and cap rate reductions in response to declining portfolio yields. Individual fixed rate deferred annuity collected premiums were $82.8 million in 2020, $118.6 million in 2019 and $139.0 million in 2018. Indexed annuity collected premiums were $93.2 million in 2020, $128.2 million in 2019 and $137.6 million in 2018. To increase spread income given lower fixed and indexed annuity sales, we increased the issuance of funding agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) during 2020. Outstanding funding agreements with FHLB, which are included in policyholder liabilities, totaled $585.2 million at December 31, 2020, $488.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $446.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe individual annuity withdrawal rate decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, partially due to the suspension of required minimum distributions by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The individual annuity\nwithdrawal rate increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to certain policies reaching the end of their interest rate guarantee period and the competitiveness of our current crediting rates relative to other financial products.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected income earned on the underlying business. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses and mortality assumptions. The impact of improved persistency also resulted in less amortization during 2020, compared with 2019. Unlocking in 2019 was driven by a change in our withdrawal rate assumptions. The impact of unlocking interest sensitive benefit reserve assumptions during 2020, was due primarily to a revision of our expectation of policyholder utilization of the guaranteed living withdrawal benefit rider on index annuities. No unlocking was considered to be necessary for interest sensitive benefit reserves during 2019 or 2018.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of Unlocking on Pre-tax Adjusted Operating Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales inducements reported in interest sensitive product benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(195) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred acquisition costs </td> <td>(1,189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,668) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in reserves reported in interest sensitive product benefits </td> <td>5,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) to pre-tax adjusted operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,863) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Annuity segment was a $1.9 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.6 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income.\nThe annualized yield on average invested assets for individual annuities decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior periods, primarily due to lower yields on new investment acquisitions from premium receipts and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing investments, compared with the average existing portfolio yield. The decrease in 2020, compared to 2019, was partially offset by higher other investment-related income while we recognized a decrease in other investment-related income in 2019 compared to 2018. See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to crediting and cap rate actions taken in 2020 in response to a declining portfolio yield and a change in our mix of business in force, partially offset by increased amortization of call option costs supporting our index annuity products. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td>

Insurance segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, partially offset by reduced other underwriting expenses and a benefit from the impact of an increase in the volume of business\nin force. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Life Insurance segment increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and the impact from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nResults for 2018 were unfavorably impacted by the correction of an immaterial error related to a closed block of interest sensitive whole life business. The immaterial error arose and accumulated over several years, with none of those previous years being materially impacted. Remediation required an adjustment to existing in force business account values as well as adjustment to benefit payments for terminated business. The correction resulted in a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million, consisting of $3.5 million related to delayed benefit payments and $2.0 million of accrued interest. The change in estimate and accrued interest resulted in an increase to 2018 interest sensitive product benefits interest credited of $2.0 million, interest sensitive death benefits of $3.3 million and traditional life future policy benefits of $0.2 million.\nDeath benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, vary from year-to-year due to changes in claim counts and average claim size. In 2020, death benefits in the Life Insurance segment include COVID-19 related claims, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaling $8.8 million.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected profits on the underlying business, which included increased mortality in 2020. Amortization, as well as reserves held on certain interest sensitive products, also changed due to the impact of unlocking. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses, premium persistency and mortality assumptions. The 2020 unlocking charge was primarily due to updating our assumptions related to spread income, with the expectation of lower market interest rates than previously assumed. During 2019, unlocking also included the extension of the deferred acquisition cost amortization period for our participating whole life insurance business based on an increase in persistency rates.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of Unlocking on Pre-tax Adjusted Operating Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of unearned revenue reserve reported in interest sensitive product charges and other income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(386) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales inducements reported in interest sensitive product benefits </td> <td>(1,207) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales inducements reported in traditional life insurance benefits </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred acquisition costs </td> <td>(5,556) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in reserves reported in interest sensitive product benefits </td> <td>(7,270) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,755) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) to pre-tax adjusted operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,123) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,327) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to prior periods, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Life Insurance segment was a $3.6 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.4 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income. Excluding the impact of the voluntary early retirement program in 2018, other underwriting expenses increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to expenses associated with system enhancements and various other general expense increases associated with the growth of our business.\nThe annualized yield on average invested assets for interest sensitive life insurance products decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to lower yields on new investment acquisitions from premium receipts and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing investments, compared with the average existing portfolio yield and lower other investment-related income. See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our interest sensitive life insurance products increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs supporting our indexed universal life products and a change in the mix of business.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Other income and other expenses increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to expanding our wealth management business. The expansion of our wealth management business has increased administrative costs along with the costs of implementing a new delivery platform to allow for additional product offerings and an enhanced customer experience. Revenues associated with our wealth management expansion have increased modestly as we continue to expand this business increasing to $4.6 million in 2020 compared to $2.2 million in 2019 and $0.5 million in 2018. Expenses, including commissions, associated with our wealth management expansion have increased to $11.1 million during 2020 compared to $7.1 million in 2019 and $3.4 million in 2018. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees resulting in a $1.1 million increase in other expenses in the Corporate and Other segment.\nEquity Income\nEquity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses attributable to our ownership interest in partnerships, joint ventures and certain companies over which we exhibit some control but have a minority ownership interest. We consistently use the most recent financial information available to account for equity income. Several of these entities are investment companies whose operating results are derived primarily from unrealized and realized gains and losses generated by their investment portfolios.\nThe level of gains and losses for these entities normally fluctuates from period to period depending on the prevailing economic environment, changes in the value of underlying investments held by the investment partnerships, the timing and success of initial public offerings or exit strategies, and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures. Equity income, net of related taxes was $5.9 million in 2020, $3.5 million in 2019 and $4.4 million in 2018. Equity income included in the Corporate segment in 2020 includes a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million from one transaction in an investment partnership. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further information.\nIncome Taxes on Adjusted Operating Income\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted operating income was 13.7% for 2020, 13.6% for 2019 and 13.9% for 2018. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments and tax-exempt investment income.

The improvement in the mortgage loan allowance for credit losses primarily reflects a reduction in mortgage loan investments since December 31, 2019, as well as improvement in the loss factors used to estimate the allowance. See Note 2 Investment Operations\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the allowance for credit losses.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2019 included an asset-backed bond due to a decline in expected cash flows.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2018 included an energy sector bond due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, an asset backed security due to concerns regarding the company's recovery plan, and a construction sector bond due to a missed bond payment. We also increased our valuation allowance on a mortgage loan due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\nFinancial Condition\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio increased 6.5% to $9,684.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $9,091.6 million at December 31, 2019. The portfolio increase is primarily due to a $421.9 million increase in the net unrealized appreciation of fixed maturities. The increase in unrealized appreciation is the result of a decrease in market interest rates driven by a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates. Additional details regarding securities in an unrealized gain or loss position at December 31, 2020 are included in the discussion that follows and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Details regarding investment allowances/impairments are discussed above in the Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments\u201d section under Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe manage the investment portfolio to optimize risk-adjusted yield within the context of prudent asset-liability management. We evaluate multiple cash flow testing scenarios as part of this process. The Company's investment policy calls for investing primarily in high-quality fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of acquisitions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>376,637 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage- and asset-backed </td> <td> </td> <td>318,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361,674 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States Government and agencies </td> <td> </td> <td>25,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-exempt municipals </td> <td> </td> <td>71,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,630 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable municipals </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,820 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>735,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>818,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective annual yield </td> <td> </td> <td>3.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.74 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit quality </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAIC 1 designation </td> <td> </td> <td>73.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAIC 2 designation </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-investment grade </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average life in years </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the first-call\u201d date. For non-callable bonds, the first-call date is always the maturity date. The weighted-average life is calculated using scheduled pay-downs and expected prepayments for amortizing securities. For non-amortizing securities, the weighted-average life is equal to the stated maturity date.\nA portion of the securities acquired during 2020 and 2019 were acquired with the proceeds from advances on our funding agreements with the FHLB. The securities acquired to support these funding agreements often carry a lower average yield than securities acquired to support our other insurance products, due to the shorter maturity and relatively low interest rate paid on those advances. In addition, certain municipal securities acquired are exempt from federal income taxes, and accordingly have a higher actual return than reflected in the yields stated above. The average yield of the securities acquired, excluding the securities supporting the funding agreements and using a tax-adjusted yield for the municipal securities, was 3.39% in 2020 and 3.84% in 2019.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Portfolio Summary\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities - available for sale: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,139,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,763,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>144A private placement </td> <td>1,823,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,699,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private placement </td> <td>320,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed maturities - available for sale </td> <td>8,283,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,702,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities </td> <td>88,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans </td> <td>994,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,011,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy loans </td> <td>195,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments </td> <td>63,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments </td> <td>58,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,684,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,091,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, 96.1% (based on carrying value) of the available-for-sale fixed maturities were investment grade debt securities, defined as being in the highest two National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) designations. Non-investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers.

unrealized losses.\nMortgage and Asset-Backed Securities\nMortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are purchased when we believe these types of investments provide superior risk-adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans. These securities are diversified as to collateral types, cash flow characteristics and maturity.\nThe repayment pattern on mortgage and other asset-backed securities is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities because the repayment terms are tied to underlying debt obligations that are subject to prepayments. The prepayment speeds (e.g., the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages) can vary based on a number of economic factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. These factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy.\nAt each balance sheet date, we review and update our expectation of future prepayment speeds and the book value of the mortgage and other asset-backed securities purchased at a premium or discount is reset, if needed. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for more detail on accounting for the amortization of premium and accrual of discount on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.\nOur direct exposure to the Alt-A home equity and subprime first-lien sectors is limited to investments in structured securities collateralized by senior tranches of residential mortgage loans. We also have a partnership interest in one fund at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, that owns securities backed by Alt-A home equity, subprime first-lien and adjustable rate mortgage collateral. The fund is reported as securities and indebtedness of related parties in our consolidated balance sheets with a fair value of $0.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2019. We do not own any direct investments in subprime lenders.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities by Collateral Type </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nof Fixed Maturities </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nof Fixed Maturities </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government agency </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime </td> <td>384,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>405,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A </td> <td>56,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime </td> <td>118,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage </td> <td>991,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,136,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>969,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,045,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateralized loan obligation </td> <td>219,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-mortgage </td> <td>399,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>376,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>381,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,373,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,593,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,293,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,432,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe mortgage- and asset-backed securities can be summarized into three broad categories: residential, commercial and other asset-backed securities.\nThe residential mortgage-backed portfolio includes government agency pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities. With a government agency pass through security, we receive a pro-rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans. CMOs consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches\u201d with varying stated maturities that provide sequential retirement of the bonds. While each tranche receives monthly interest payments, a subsequent tranche is not entitled to receive payment of principal until the entire principal of the preceding tranche is paid off. We primarily invest in sequential tranches, which allow us to manage cash flow stability and prepayment risk by the level of tranche in which we invest. In addition, to provide call protection and more stable average lives, we invest in CMOs such as planned amortization class (PAC) and targeted amortization class (TAC) securities. PAC bonds provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds and provide some protection against prepayment risk. TAC bonds provide protection from a rise in the prepayment rate due to falling interest rates. We generally do not purchase certain types of CMOs that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to excessive prepayment risk.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

agency-backed securities with a carrying value of $911.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $845.5 million at December 31, 2019. Also included in the CMBS portfolio are military housing bonds totaling $170.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $163.9 million at December 31, 2019. These bonds are used to fund the construction of multi-family homes on United States military bases. The bonds are backed by a first mortgage lien on residential military housing projects.\nThe other asset-backed securities are backed by both residential and non-residential collateral. The collateral for residential asset-backed securities primarily consists of second lien fixed-rate home equity loans. The cash flows of these securities are less subject to prepayment risk than residential mortgage-backed securities as the borrowers are less likely to refinance than those with only a first lien mortgage. The collateral for non-residential asset-backed securities primarily includes securities backed by credit card receivables, auto dealer receivables, auto installment loans, aircraft leases, middle market and syndicated business loans, timeshare receivables and trade and account receivables. The majority of these securities are high-quality, short-duration assets with limited cash flow variability.\nOur CLO portfolio included in other asset-backed securities is high quality, with all of the securities rated NAIC-1. Internal\nstress testing has indicated that the weighted average constant default rate (CDR) of our portfolio without suffering loss is 17%.\nThe CDR is the constant default rate (annually) that a CLO must suffer before our tranche takes its first dollar loss.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Securities\nState and political subdivision securities totaled $1,416.0 million, or 17.1% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020, and $1,477.2 million, or 19.2% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2019, and include investments in general obligation, revenue and municipal housing bonds. Our investment strategy is to utilize municipal bonds in addition to corporate bonds, as we believe they provide additional diversification and have historically low default rates compared with similarly rated corporate bonds. We evaluate the credit strength of the underlying issues on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, excluding insurance, prior to acquisition. The majority of the municipal bonds we hold are investment grade credits without consideration of insurance. Our municipal bonds are well diversified by type and geography with the top exposure being water and sewer revenue bonds. Our municipal bond holdings were trading at 115.3% of amortized cost at December 31, 2020. We do not hold any Puerto Rico-related bonds. Exposure to the state of Illinois and municipalities within the state accounted for 1.1% of our total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our Illinois-related portfolio holdings were rated investment grade and were valued at 119.4% of amortized cost.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loans totaled $994.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $1,011.7 million at December 31, 2019. Our mortgage loans are diversified as to property type, location and loan size, and are collateralized by the related properties. The total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 212 at December 31, 2020 and 209 at December 31, 2019. In 2020, new loans ranged from $2.8 million to $15.0 million in size, with an average loan size of $6.1 million, an average loan term of 15 years and an average net yield of 3.37%. Our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type. The majority of our mortgage loans amortize principal, with 2.1% that are interest-only loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the average loan-to-value of the current outstanding principal balance using the most recent appraised value was 49.9% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.7 based on the results of our 2019 annual study.

Deferred acquisition costs decreased during the same period primarily due to a $120.2 million increase in the impact of the change in net unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities during the period. Other assets decreased during the same period primarily due to the impact of amortization of LIHTC investments. Assets and liabilities held in separate accounts increased during the same period due to market performance on the underlying investment portfolios.\nFuture policy benefits increased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to an increase in the volume of life business in force. Deferred income taxes increased during the same period primarily due to the tax impact of the change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments.\nStockholders' Equity\nAs discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, stockholders' equity was impacted by capital deployment actions during 2020. We paid a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share on our common stock and increased our regular quarterly common stock dividend by 4.2% to $0.50 per share.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total FBL Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,692,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,485,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stockholders' equity </td> <td>1,689,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Per share impact of accumulated other comprehensive income </td> <td>24.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Since accumulated other comprehensive income fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of investments caused principally by changes in market interest rates, we believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information.\nOur stockholders' equity increased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to the change in unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities during the period and net income, partially offset by dividends paid.\nMarket Risks of Financial Instruments\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and fair value of investments. The yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. The fair value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.\nA majority of our insurance liabilities are backed by fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. The weighted average life of the fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolio, based on fair values, was approximately 11.0 years at December 31, 2020 and 11.3 years at December 31, 2019. Accordingly, the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. The extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors:\n\u2022The average life of the portfolio.\n\u2022The amount and speed at which market interest rates rise or fall.\n\u2022The amount by which bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage- and asset-backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates or decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Cash Flows from Investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 and Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturity securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,179,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>347,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,155,258 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans </td> <td>995,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>654,956 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,174,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>485,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>459,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,810,214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above summarizes cash inflows from the maturity or prepayment of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans that will be available for benefits or reinvestment. These cash flow estimates are based on our existing investment holdings and do not anticipate the effect of new acquisitions or voluntary sales of these securities. The estimates include assumptions for the timing of paydowns on asset-backed and other securities, and accordingly, may not represent actual amounts that will be received during the periods presented or changes to these assumptions during the year. In a declining or low interest rate environment, prepayments and redemptions affecting our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loan investments may increase as issuers and borrowers seek to refinance at a lower rate.\nFor a majority of our products, profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and interest crediting rates on our insurance liabilities. For index products, profitability on the portion of the policyholders' account balance allocated to an index option is generally determined as the difference between interest yields on investments and the cost of call options. For variable annuities and variable universal life policies, profitability on the portion of the policyholder's account balance invested in the fixed general account option, if any, is also affected by the spreads earned. For the variable products, the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts.\nFor a portion of our business in force, we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in response to changes in portfolio yield. However, the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors and contractual guarantees. Surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial services institutions. In addition, if market rates were to stay at a low level for an extended period of time, our spread earnings could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products. See Part 1, Item 1 - Business, Business Segments for the ranges of guaranteed rates and where our products fall within those ranges.\nA prolonged period of low interest rates may result in increased downward pressure on average earned yields for the investment portfolios supporting our annuity and universal life business as higher-yielding fixed maturity securities and mortgages are sold, mature or are prepaid and replaced with lower-yielding investments. Lower investment income may cause us to lower crediting rates on our spread-based annuity and life insurance products, which in turn may reduce their attractiveness to potential customers. Failure to lower crediting rates as portfolio investment yields decline, either by choice, to ensure our spread-based\ninsurance products are competitive within the marketplace or for contractual reasons in the case of products earning guaranteed rates, will result in lower earnings.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Crediting Rates Compared to Guarantees </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Liabilities at December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Above Minimum Guarantee </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discretionary rate setting products with minimum guarantees: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate annuities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,562,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indexed annuities </td> <td>842,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life insurance </td> <td>925,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuities and variable universal life insurance </td> <td>364,861 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total discretionary products </td> <td>4,694,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-discretionary products </td> <td>1,031,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest sensitive product liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,725,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-discretionary products primarily represent funding agreements, guaranteed investment contracts and supplementary contracts involving life contingencies for which we do not have the ability to adjust crediting rates.\nWe design our products to encourage persistency and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to help ensure targeted spreads are earned. In addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our products, certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions. Products such as supplementary contracts with life contingencies are not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal. Depending on the product, surrender charge rates on annuity contracts range up to 10.0% and surrender charge periods range up to 10 years and typically decrease 1.0% to 2.0% for every year the contract is in force.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender and Discretionary Withdrawal Characteristics of Interest Sensitive Products and Supplementary Contracts Without Life Contingencies </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Liabilities at\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charge rate: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to 5% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,158,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 5%, but still subject to surrender charge </td> <td>930,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to surrender charge </td> <td>3,482,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal </td> <td>429,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA major component of our asset-liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the expected cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities. We use models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios. Information from these models is used in the determination of investment strategies. Effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It measures the approximate percentage change in the fair value of a portfolio when interest rates change by 100 basis points at all points on the curve. Key rate duration is a bifurcation of the effective duration that measures the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates within two points on a curve. These measures include the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments. When the estimated effective durations of assets and liabilities are similar, exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk stems from both the longevity of our life block and the interest rate sensitivity of our annuity products. We actively manage the projected cash flows, duration and key rate duration of these assets and liabilities by minimizing the difference between them. While it can be difficult to maintain asset and liability durations that are perfectly matched in a dynamic environment, we have identified various strategies that can be implemented if effective duration or key rate duration mismatches exceed acceptable tolerances.\nIf interest rates had increased 10% from levels at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments would have decreased approximately $75.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $123.2 million at December 31, 2019. These hypothetical changes in value do not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value for a portion of the underlying contracts.\nThe models used to estimate the impact of a 10% change in market interest rates utilize many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations. Key assumptions in the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset-backed securities. The above estimates do not attempt to measure the financial statement impact on the resulting change in deferred acquisition costs, unearned revenue reserves, policyholder liabilities and income taxes. Due to the subjectivity of these assumptions, the actual impact of a 10% change in rates on the fair values would likely be different from that estimated.\nEquity Risk\nEquity price risk is limited due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at December 31, 2020. However, we are exposed to equity price risk in the following ways:\n\u2022Changes in the fair value of our equity securities are reported in earnings.\n\u2022We earn mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts at annual rates ranging from 0% to 1.45% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. As a result, revenues from these sources fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the equity, fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts.\n\u2022We have equity price risk to the extent we may owe amounts under the guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit provisions of our variable annuity contracts. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional discussion of these provisions.\n\u2022We also have equity price risk related to index product reserves related to guarantee living withdrawal benefits.\n\u2022Our profitability would be impacted if there were little or no gains in the entire series of options purchased over the expected life of an indexed product, as we would incur expenses for credited interest over and above our option costs.\n\u2022The amortization of deferred acquisition costs on our variable business can fluctuate with changes in the performance of the underlying separate accounts. See the Corporate and Other Segment discussion above for additional discussion of this amortization.\nCredit Risk\nWe have exposure to credit risk as it relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given entity to make timely payments of principal and interest. See Financial Condition - Investments\u201d for additional information about credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nDuring 2020, our operating activities generated cash flows totaling $229.1 million, consisting of net income of $72.3 million adjusted for non-cash operating revenues and expenses netting to $156.8 million. We used cash of $197.7 million in our investing activities during 2020. The primary uses were $914.0 million of investment acquisitions, mostly in fixed maturity securities, partially offset by $778.5 million in sales, maturities and repayments of investments. Our financing activities used cash of $35.9 million during 2020. The primary financing source was $630.5 million in receipts from interest sensitive products credited to policyholder account balances, offset by $570.1 million for return of policyholder account balances on interest sensitive products and $86.2 million for dividends paid to stockholders. Funding agreements with the FHLB represent $264.5 million of receipts from interest sensitive products and $180.0 million of return of policyholder account balances.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into insurance contracts, financing transactions, lease agreements or other commitments that are necessary or beneficial to our operations. These commitments may obligate us to certain cash flows during future periods. Our policyholder obligations are our largest contractual obligations. The differences between contractual obligations and the balance sheet values of our insurance liabilities are primarily the accumulation of interest and death benefits in excess of related policyholder reserves.\nOn a consolidated basis, we anticipate that funds to meet our short-term and long-term contractual obligations, capital expenditures, cash dividends to stockholders and operating cash needs will come from existing capital and internally-generated funds. We manage our investment portfolio to provide cash flows needed for policyholder obligations in the normal course of business as discussed in the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section above. However, there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since benefits and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment, our financial strength ratings, the economy and other factors that impact policyholder behavior. Farm Bureau Life is a member of the FHLB, which provides a source for additional liquidity if needed. This membership allows us to utilize fixed or floating rate advances offered by the FHLB and secured by qualifying collateral. Our total capacity to utilize such advances is impacted by multiple factors including the market value of eligible collateral, our level of statutory admitted assets and excess reserves and our willingness or capacity to hold activity-based FHLB common stock.\nSources and Uses of Capital Resources\nParent company cash inflows from operations consist primarily of fees that it charges various subsidiaries and affiliates for management of their operations, expense reimbursements and tax settlements from subsidiaries and affiliates, investment income and dividends from subsidiaries, if declared and paid. Revenue sources for the parent company during 2020 included management fees from subsidiaries and affiliates totaling $7.9 million and dividends of $98.5 million. Cash outflows are principally for salaries, taxes and other expenses related to providing management services, dividends on outstanding stock, stock repurchases and interest on our parent company debt.\nWe paid regular cash dividends on our common and preferred stock totaling $49.2 million in 2020, $47.5 million in 2019 and $45.8 million in 2018. In addition, we paid a special $1.50 per common share cash dividend in March 2020, March 2019 and March 2018 totaling $37.0 million, $37.0 million, and $37.3 million, respectively. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company is permitted to declare and pay, and has agreed to declare and pay, quarterly cash dividends of $0.52 per share of common stock. We will also pay the quarterly cash dividend of $0.0075 per Series B redeemable preferred share. The common stock dividend rates are analyzed quarterly and are dependent upon our capital and liquidity positions. In addition, alternative uses of excess capital may impact future dividend levels. Assuming these quarterly dividend rates, the common and preferred dividends would total approximately $50.9 million in 2021. The parent company expects to have sufficient resources and cash flows to meet its interest and dividend payments throughout 2021. The parent company had available cash and investments totaling $44.2 million at December 31, 2020. The parent company expects to rely on available cash resources, dividends from Farm Bureau Life and management fee income to make dividend payments to its stockholders, interest payments on its debt and to fund any capital initiatives such as stock repurchases. In addition, our parent company and Farm Bureau Life have entered into a reciprocal line of credit arrangement, which provides additional liquidity for either entity up to $20.0 million. We had no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2020.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we have periodically taken advantage of opportunities to repurchase our outstanding Class A common stock through Class A common stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors. There was $26.3 million remaining for repurchases at December 31, 2020, under the current $50 million Class A common stock repurchase program. Completion of this program is dependent on market conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the exact timing of any repurchases or the number of shares that we will repurchase. The share repurchase program may be modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. Under the Merger Agreement, we have agreed not to repurchase any additional shares of our capital stock from the date of the Merger Agreement through the closing of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, including pursuant to our equity awards plans. We repurchased 290,144 shares of Class A common stock for $10.0 million in 2020, 66,475 shares of Class A common stock for $4.6 million in 2019 and 232,837 shares of stock Class A common stock for $15.9 million in 2018.\nInterest payments on our debt totaled $4.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Interest payments on our debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 are estimated to be $4.9 million in 2021.\nFarm Bureau Life's cash inflows primarily consist of premiums, deposits to policyholder account balances, income from investments, sales, maturities and calls of investments; and repayments of investment principal. Farm Bureau Life's cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyholder account balances, investment purchases and payment of policy acquisition costs, policyholder benefits, income taxes, current operating expenses and dividends. Life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow that may be measured by the degree to which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred. The remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business. Continuing operations and financing activities from Farm Bureau Life relating to interest sensitive products provided funds totaling $286.1 million in 2020, $235.5 million in 2019 and $268.9 million in 2018.\nFarm Bureau Life's ability to pay dividends to the parent company is limited by law to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus) as of the date the dividend is paid, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the State of Iowa. At December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory unassigned surplus was $494.6 million. There are certain additional limits on the amount of dividends that may be paid within a year without approval of the Insurance Division, Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the Iowa Insurance Division) as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. During 2021, the maximum amount legally available for distribution to the parent company without further regulatory approval is $87.4 million. Timing of such dividends during the year is limited based on the timing of dividends paid within the preceding 12 months.\nWe manage the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital (RBC) ratio, a measure of solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC based on the various risk factors related to an insurance company's capital and surplus, including insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. The insurance regulators monitor the level of RBC against a statutory authorized control level\u201d RBC at which point regulators have the option to assume control of the insurance company. The company action level RBC is 200% of the authorized control level and is the first point at which any action would be triggered. As of December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory total adjusted capital was $696.1 million, resulting in an RBC ratio of 528%, based on company action level capital of $131.8 million.\nMerger Agreement\nUnder the Merger Agreement, described in Part I, Item 1. Business, Merger Agreement,\u201d we are required to pay a termination fee of up to $18.5 million, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, and reimburse the out-of-pocket expenses of FBPCIC, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates up to a maximum of $5.3 million, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nIn accordance with GAAP, premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products, such as ordinary annuities and universal life insurance, are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses. Our insurance subsidiaries receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. For index products, proceeds from call options are earned from a portion of the funds deposited, which are passed through to the contract holders in the form of index credits. Index credits and interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in our consolidated financial statements.\nPremium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits.\nFor variable universal life and variable annuities, premiums received are not reported as revenues. Similar to universal life and ordinary annuities, revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders. Expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances.\nThe costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally commissions), defined as deferred acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. We also record an asset, value of insurance in force acquired, for the cost assigned to insurance contracts when an insurance company is acquired. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in\u201d at the date the policies are issued. For participating traditional life insurance and interest sensitive products, these costs are generally amortized in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is periodically adjusted or unlocked when we revise key assumptions used in the calculation. For example, deferred acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits.\nPension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and/or discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The December 31, 2020 pension obligation was computed based on an average 2.68% discount rate, which was based on yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. The long-term return on plan assets is based on current and projected asset allocations. Declines in comparable bond and equity yields would decrease our net pension asset.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting estimates and the hypothetical effects of changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate, are included in the following table. We have discussed the identification, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Caption </td> <td>Description of Critical Estimate </td> <td>Assumptions / Approach Used </td> <td>Effect if Different\nAssumptions / Approach Used </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities - available for sale </td> <td>Excluding U.S. Government treasury securities, very few of our fixed maturity securities trade on the balance sheet date. For those securities without a trade on the balance sheet date, fair values are determined using valuation processes that require judgment. </td> <td>Fair values are obtained primarily from a variety of independent pricing sources, whose results we evaluate internally. Details regarding valuation techniques and processes are summarized in Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. </td> <td>At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale had a fair value of $8,283.7 million, with gross unrealized gains totaling $1,123.2 million and gross unrealized losses totaling $14.0 million. Due to the large number of fixed maturity securities held, the unique attributes of each security and the complexity of valuation methods, it is not practical to estimate a potential range of fair values for different assumptions and methods that could be used in the valuation process. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities - available for sale </td> <td>We are required to exercise judgment to determine to what extent an unrealized loss is due to credit and establish an allowance for credit losses on a security. Whether a realized loss needs to be recognized in earnings and the amount of the loss primarily depends on whether (1) a decline in fair value is credit related, (2) our intent to sell the security and (3) whether or not we could be required to sell prior to recovery. The amortized cost is not adjusted by the loss reported in earnings if the decline is credit related and the resulting allowance can increase or decrease between reporting periods. If we have the intent to sell the security or we could be required to sell the security prior to recovery the previous amortized cost is adjusted by the loss reported in earnings to provide a new cost basis for the fixed maturity security. </td> <td>We evaluate the operating results of the underlying issuer, near-term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, causes for the decline in value, and other key economic measures and our intent to sell and whether or not we would be required to sell prior to recovery. </td> <td>At December 31, 2020, we had $18.8 million of gross unrealized losses, on which we have established an allowance for credit losses of $4.9 million. The allowance for credit losses we have recorded at December 31, 2020 was established at the fair value of the underlying investments, accordingly this would represent the maximum potential loss for those investments. The allowance represents our best estimate of potential losses across the fixed maturity portfolio. Our maximum additional loss exposure would be $13.9 million which represents the total unrealized portfolio losses not subject to an allowance for credit losses. Details regarding these securities are included in the Financial Condition - Investments\u201d section above.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we believe that all credit allowance losses within the portfolio have been recognized. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Caption </td> <td>Description of Critical Estimate </td> <td>Assumptions / Approach Used </td> <td>Effect if Different\nAssumptions / Approach Used </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred acquisition costs </td> <td>Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following:\n- amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force,\n- yield on investments supporting the liabilities,\n- amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies,\n- amount of policy fees and charges and\n- amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies. </td> <td>Estimates used in the calculation of amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which are revised at least annually, are based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. </td> <td>Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is expected to total approximately $27.2 million for 2021, excluding the impact of new production in 2021.\nBased upon a historical analysis of fluctuations in estimated gross profits, we believe it is reasonably likely that a 10% change in estimated gross profits could occur. A 10% increase in estimated gross profits for 2021 would result in $2.0 million of additional amortization expense. Correspondingly, a 10% decrease in estimated gross profits would result in a $2.0 million reduction of amortization expense. The information above is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future changes in estimated gross profits. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future policy benefits </td> <td>Reserving for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, lapse rates, surrender rates and dividend crediting rates.\n</td> <td>These assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant. </td> <td>Due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of traditional life insurance reserves, it is not practical to perform a sensitivity analysis on the impact of reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions. The cost of performing detailed calculations using different assumption scenarios outweighs the benefit that would be derived.

Pension expense for 2020 totaled $4.1 million.\n</td> <td>To determine our net periodic pension costs for 2020, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.85% and a discount rate of 3.37%. Details regarding the method used to determine the discount rate are summarized in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. </td> <td>The long-term rate of return may fluctuate over time based on asset mix and if investment returns over a long period of time significantly differ from historical returns. The discount rate changes annually as it is based on current yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension obligations. As fluctuations in the expected long-term rate of return and discount rate have been historically moderate and we have no current plans to change our investment strategy significantly, we believe a change of up to 100 basis points is reasonably likely. A 100 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would result in a $1.2 million increase in pension expense and a 100 basis point increase would result in a $1.2 million decrease to pension expense. A 100 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would result in a $2.7 million increase in pension expense while a 100 basis point increase would result in a $2.4 million decrease to pension expense.

No valuation allowance was recorded on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020.\n</td> <td>We utilize tax planning strategies, which require forward-looking assumptions and management judgment, to determine the deductibility of certain items and to assess the need for a valuation allowance.\nDuring periods in which we have deferred tax assets related to unrealized investment losses, we utilize tax planning strategies, including a buy-and-hold investment philosophy for securities experiencing unrealized losses and the sale of appreciated securities to ensure the deductibility of such losses in future periods. </td> <td>At December 31, 2020, we held gross deferred tax assets totaling $45.0 million, primarily related to future policy benefits, employee benefits and loss carryforwards. Utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on our future earnings. No valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets, as we believe future earnings will be sufficient to ensure their utilization. If future earnings are no longer expected to be sufficient, a valuation allowance will need to be established. Given the number of variables that impact the level of future earnings, it is not practicable to estimate a range of possible outcomes to the valuation of the deferred tax assets. Future changes in tax rates and other tax laws may also impact the utilization of deferred tax assets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Changes\nDuring 2020, the company adopted new accounting guidance for the accounting for credit impairments of certain financial instruments.

See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our interest sensitive life insurance products increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs supporting our indexed universal life products and a change in the mix of business.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected profits on the underlying business, which included increased mortality in 2020. Amortization, as well as reserves held on certain interest sensitive products, also changed due to the impact of unlocking. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses, premium persistency and mortality assumptions. The 2020 unlocking charge was primarily due to updating our assumptions related to spread income, with the expectation of lower market interest rates than previously assumed. During 2019, unlocking also included the extension of the deferred acquisition cost amortization period for our participating whole life insurance business based on an increase in persistency rates.\n(1)Amount represents a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other items impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act.

For those securities without a trade on the balance sheet date, fair values are determined using valuation processes that require judgment. Fair values are obtained primarily from a variety of independent pricing sources, whose results we evaluate internally. Details regarding valuation techniques and processes are summarized in Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale had a fair value of $8,283.7 million, with gross unrealized gains totaling $1,123.2 million and gross unrealized losses totaling $14.0 million. Due to the large number of fixed maturity securities held, the unique attributes of each security and the complexity of valuation methods, it is not practical to estimate a potential range of fair values for different assumptions and methods that could be used in the valuation process. Fixed maturities - available for sale We are required to exercise judgment to determine to what extent an unrealized loss is due to credit and establish an allowance for credit losses on a security. Whether a realized loss needs to be recognized in earnings and the amount of the loss primarily depends on whether (1) a decline in fair value is credit related, (2) our intent to sell the security and (3) whether or not we could be required to sell prior to recovery. The amortized cost is not adjusted by the loss reported in earnings if the decline is credit related and the resulting allowance can increase or decrease between reporting periods. If we have the intent to sell the security or we could be required to sell the security prior to recovery the previous amortized cost is adjusted by the loss reported in earnings to provide a new cost basis for the fixed maturity security. We evaluate the operating results of the underlying issuer, near-term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, causes for the decline in value, and other key economic measures and our intent to sell and whether or not we would be required to sell prior to recovery. At December 31, 2020, we had $18.8 million of gross unrealized losses, on which we have established an allowance for credit losses of $4.9 million. The allowance for credit losses we have recorded at December 31, 2020 was established at the fair value of the underlying investments, accordingly this would represent the maximum potential loss for those investments. The allowance represents our best estimate of potential losses across the fixed maturity portfolio. Our maximum additional loss exposure would be $13.9 million which represents the total unrealized portfolio losses not subject to an allowance for credit losses. Details regarding these securities are included in the Financial Condition - Investments\u201d section above. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we believe that all credit allowance losses within the portfolio have been recognized. \nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities by NAIC Designation and Origination Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2004 & Prior </td> <td> </td> <td>2005 to 2008 </td> <td> </td> <td>2009 & After </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAIC Designation </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized\nCost </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nValue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>823,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>934,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>922,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,056,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>851,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>965,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>991,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,136,333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, the company adopted new accounting guidance for the accounting for credit impairments of certain financial instruments. Under the new guidance, credit losses are required to be estimated using an expected loss model under which an allowance for credit losses is established and reflected as a charge to earnings. This change and other accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted are discussed further in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\n\u2022Product actions

totaling $49.2 million in 2020, $47.5 million in 2019 and $45.8 million in 2018. In addition, we paid a special $1.50 per common share cash dividend in March 2020, March 2019 and March 2018 totaling $37.0 million, $37.0 million, and $37.3 million, respectively. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company is permitted to declare and pay, and has agreed to declare and pay, quarterly cash dividends of $0.52 per share of common stock. We will also pay the quarterly cash dividend of $0.0075 per Series B redeemable preferred share. The common stock dividend rates are analyzed quarterly and are dependent upon our capital and liquidity positions. In addition, alternative uses of excess capital may impact future dividend levels. Assuming these quarterly dividend rates, the common and preferred dividends would total approximately $50.9 million in 2021. The parent company expects to have sufficient resources and cash flows to meet its interest and dividend payments throughout 2021. The parent company had available cash and investments totaling $44.2 million at December 31, 2020. The parent company expects to rely on available cash resources, dividends from Farm Bureau Life and management fee income to make dividend payments to its stockholders, interest payments on its debt and to fund any capital initiatives such as stock repurchases. In addition, our parent company and Farm Bureau Life have entered into a reciprocal line of credit arrangement, which provides additional liquidity for either entity up to $20.0 million.

There was $26.3 million remaining for repurchases at December 31, 2020, under the current $50 million Class A common stock repurchase program. Completion of this program is dependent on market conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the exact timing of any repurchases or the number of shares that we will repurchase. The share repurchase program may be modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. Under the Merger Agreement, we have agreed not to repurchase any additional shares of our capital stock from the date of the Merger Agreement through the closing of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, including pursuant to our equity awards plans. We repurchased 290,144 shares of Class A common stock for $10.0 million in 2020, 66,475 shares of Class A common stock for $4.6 million in 2019 and 232,837 shares of stock Class A common stock for $15.9 million in 2018.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change over prior year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to FBL Financial Group, Inc. </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial impact of the Tax Act (1) </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(617) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proposed acquisition transaction expenses (2) </td> <td>2,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains/losses on investments (3) </td> <td>12,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,813) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(312) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(161) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives (3) </td> <td>4,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,703) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(283) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(144) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income (4) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax adjusted operating income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity segment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life Insurance segment </td> <td>36,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other segment </td> <td>8,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax adjusted operating income </td> <td>106,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes on adjusted operating income </td> <td>(14,646) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,584) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,629) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income (4) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share -

Different Assumptions / Approach Used Deferred acquisition costs Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: - amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force, - yield on investments supporting the liabilities, - amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, - amount of policy fees and charges and - amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies. Estimates used in the calculation of amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which are revised at least annually, are based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is expected to total approximately $27.2 million for 2021, excluding the impact of new production in 2021. Based upon a historical analysis of fluctuations in estimated gross profits, we believe it is reasonably likely that a 10% change in estimated gross profits could occur. A 10% increase in estimated gross profits for 2021 would result in $2.0 million of additional amortization expense. Correspondingly, a 10% decrease in estimated gross profits would result in a $2.0 million reduction of amortization expense. The information above is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future changes in estimated gross profits. Future policy benefits Reserving for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, lapse rates, surrender rates and dividend crediting rates. These assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant. Due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of traditional life insurance reserves, it is not practical to perform a sensitivity analysis on the impact of reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions.

We also record an asset, value of insurance in force acquired, for the cost assigned to insurance contracts when an insurance company is acquired. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in\u201d at the date the policies are issued. For participating traditional life insurance and interest sensitive products, these costs are generally amortized in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is periodically adjusted or unlocked when we revise key assumptions used in the calculation. For example, deferred acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\n(1)Premiums collected is a non-GAAP measure of sales production, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other data </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life premiums collected, net of reinsurance (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy liabilities and accruals, end of period </td> <td>3,226,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,082,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,990,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life insurance in force, end of period </td> <td>63,406,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,566,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,968,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested assets, at amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses (2) </td> <td>3,244,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,146,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,033,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investment-related income included in net investment income (3) </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average aggregate interest sensitive life account value (8) </td> <td>908,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>879,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>853,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest sensitive life insurance spread: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized yield on average invested assets (4) </td> <td>4.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized average crediting rate (5) </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spread </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life insurance lapse and surrender rates (9) </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor the financial condition and operations of the issuers of securities rated below investment grade and of the issuers of certain investment grade securities for which we have concerns regarding credit quality that could potentially require a credit allowance.

discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The December 31, 2020 pension obligation was computed based on an average 2.68% discount rate, which was based on yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. The long-term return on plan assets is based on current and projected asset allocations. Declines in comparable bond and equity yields would decrease our net pension asset.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, described in Part I, Item 1.

In addition, certain municipal securities acquired are exempt from federal income taxes, and accordingly have a higher actual return than reflected in the yields stated above. The average yield of the securities acquired, excluding the securities supporting the funding agreements and using a tax-adjusted yield for the municipal securities, was 3.39% in 2020 and 3.84% in 2019.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected other assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>12,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable </td> <td>115,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred acquisition costs </td> <td>176,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets </td> <td>152,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets held in separate accounts </td> <td>674,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>645,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected other liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future policy benefits </td> <td>7,616,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,393,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other policyholder funds </td> <td>602,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes </td> <td>211,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities </td> <td>102,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities held in separate accounts </td> <td>674,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>645,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe level of gains and losses for these entities normally fluctuates from period to period depending on the prevailing economic environment, changes in the value of underlying investments held by the investment partnerships, the timing and success of initial public offerings or exit strategies, and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures.

Our mortgage loans are diversified as to property type, location and loan size, and are collateralized by the related properties. The total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 212 at December 31, 2020 and 209 at December 31, 2019. In 2020, new loans ranged from $2.8 million to $15.0 million in size, with an average loan size of $6.1 million, an average loan term of 15 years and an average net yield of 3.37%. Our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type. The majority of our mortgage loans amortize principal, with 2.1% that are interest-only loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the average loan-to-value of the current outstanding principal balance using the most recent appraised value was 49.9% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.7 based on the results of our 2019 annual study.

The weighted average life of the fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolio, based on fair values, was approximately 11.0 years at December 31, 2020 and 11.3 years at December 31, 2019. Accordingly, the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. The extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors:\nMarket Risks of Financial Instruments\n(2)Average invested assets, including applicable investments held as securities and indebtedness of related parties and cash equivalents, is the average of investment balances at the beginning of the reporting period and as of the end of each quarter throughout the reporting period. Average invested assets are used in the calculation of the annualized investment yield.\nThe table above summarizes cash inflows from the maturity or prepayment of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans that will be available for benefits or reinvestment. These cash flow estimates are based on our existing investment holdings and do not anticipate the effect of new acquisitions or voluntary sales of these securities. The estimates include assumptions for the timing of paydowns on asset-backed and other securities, and accordingly, may not represent actual amounts that will be received during the periods presented or changes to these assumptions during the year. In a declining or low interest rate environment, prepayments and redemptions affecting our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loan investments may increase as issuers and borrowers seek to refinance at a lower rate.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\n\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Quality of Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities with Unrealized Losses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAIC Designation </td> <td> </td> <td>Equivalent Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying Value of Securities with\nGross Unrealized\nLosses </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Unrealized Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>AAA, AA, A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,871) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td>43,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,397) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total investment grade </td> <td> </td> <td>313,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td>BB </td> <td> </td> <td>41,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,317) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>B </td> <td> </td> <td>14,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,364) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>In or near default </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total below investment grade </td> <td> </td> <td>56,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,681) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>370,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,949) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have organized our discussion and analysis as follows:\n\nLower fixed maturity interest rates driven by lower U.S. Treasury interest rates resulted in an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities during 2020. The increase in fair value of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, resulted in an increase in our book value per common share to $69.24 at December 31, 2020 from $60.12 at December 31, 2019.\nInterest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and fair value of investments. The yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. The fair value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender and Discretionary Withdrawal Characteristics of Interest Sensitive Products and Supplementary Contracts Without Life Contingencies </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Liabilities at\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surrender charge rate: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to 5% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,158,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 5%, but still subject to surrender charge </td> <td>930,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to surrender charge </td> <td>3,482,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal </td> <td>429,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits.\nFor a majority of our products, profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and interest crediting rates on our insurance liabilities. For index products, profitability on the portion of the policyholders' account balance allocated to an index option is generally determined as the difference between interest yields on investments and the cost of call options. For variable annuities and variable universal life policies, profitability on the portion of the policyholder's account balance invested in the fixed general account option, if any, is also affected by the spreads earned. For the variable products, the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts.\n\u2022We then review the results of operations beginning with an overview of the total Company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment.\nOur direct exposure to the Alt-A home equity and subprime first-lien sectors is limited to investments in structured securities collateralized by senior tranches of residential mortgage loans. We also have a partnership interest in one fund at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, that owns securities backed by Alt-A home equity, subprime first-lien and adjustable rate mortgage collateral. The fund is reported as securities and indebtedness of related parties in our consolidated balance sheets with a fair value of $0.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2019. We do not own any direct investments in subprime lenders.\n(4)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n\nWe believe COVID-19 and the impact it had on our economy contributed to the following financial results during 2020:\nOther income and other expenses include fees and expenses from sales of brokered products and operating results of our non-insurance subsidiaries, including wealth management services, advisory, management and leasing activities. Other income and other expenses increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to expanding our wealth management business. The expansion of our wealth management business has increased administrative costs along with the costs of implementing a new delivery platform to allow for additional product offerings and an enhanced customer experience. Revenues associated with our wealth management expansion have increased modestly as we continue to expand this business increasing to $4.6 million in 2020 compared to $2.2 million in 2019 and $0.5 million in 2018. Expenses, including commissions, associated with our wealth management expansion have increased to $11.1 million during 2020 compared to $7.1 million in 2019 and $3.4 million in 2018. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees resulting in a $1.1 million increase in other expenses in the Corporate and Other segment.\nEquity price risk is limited due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at December 31, 2020. However, we are exposed to equity price risk in the following ways:\n\n(4)Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of earnings, see Overview section above for additional information.\n\u2022U.S. unemployment increased to 6.7% at December 31, 2020 based on estimates, compared to 3.5% at December 31, 2019.\nEquity Risk\nThe average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force decreased slightly in 2020, compared to 2019, as withdrawals and surrenders exceeded annuity premiums. The average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to continued sales and the crediting of interest. Growth in our indexed annuity business in force continues to drive increases in interest sensitive product charges. Premiums collected decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to decreased sales of our fixed rate deferred and indexed annuity products, as sales were negatively impacted by crediting and cap rate reductions in response to declining portfolio yields. Individual fixed rate deferred annuity collected premiums were $82.8 million in 2020, $118.6 million in 2019 and $139.0 million in 2018. Indexed annuity collected premiums were $93.2 million in 2020, $128.2 million in 2019 and $137.6 million in 2018. To increase spread income given lower fixed and indexed annuity sales, we increased the issuance of funding agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) during 2020. Outstanding funding agreements with FHLB, which are included in policyholder liabilities, totaled $585.2 million at December 31, 2020, $488.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $446.0 million at December 31, 2018.\n\u2022sources of earnings and changes in stockholders' equity,\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted operating income was 13.7% for 2020, 13.6% for 2019 and 13.9% for 2018. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments and tax-exempt investment income. The effective rate for 2019 also differs from the federal statutory rate due to non-recurring tax benefits of $2.5 million resulting from the execution of a tax planning strategy to adjust our tax-basis policy reserves. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information on income taxes.\n\u2022Finally, we discuss critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards. The critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult or complex judgment.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-discretionary products primarily represent funding agreements, guaranteed investment contracts and supplementary contracts involving life contingencies for which we do not have the ability to adjust crediting rates.\n\nbusiness, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Unlocking generally reflects changes in projected earned spreads, separate account performance and withdrawal and mortality assumptions.\nMortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are purchased when we believe these types of investments provide superior risk-adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans. These securities are diversified as to collateral types, cash flow characteristics and maturity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created several operational challenges during 2020. Our initial focus was to quickly transition to working at home, safeguarding employees and reducing the risk of business interruption. Social distancing impacted our sales process between our agents and client/members. The launch of our accelerated underwriting process during the third quarter 2020, led to some processing delays with a third-party provider, which the vendor attributed to be partially due to COVID-19. We took action to address the delays for our client/members and worked with the vendor to remediate the accelerated underwriting process.\nFinancial Condition\nThe change in allowance for credit losses in the finance sector reflects two fixed maturity securities with an allowance established as the difference of the investments' amortized cost and fair value. The improvement in the mortgage loan allowance for credit losses primarily reflects a reduction in mortgage loan investments since December 31, 2019, as well as improvement in the loss factors used to estimate the allowance. See Note 2 Investment Operations\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the allowance for credit losses.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2018 included an energy sector bond due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, an asset backed security due to concerns regarding the company's recovery plan, and a construction sector bond due to a missed bond payment. We also increased our valuation allowance on a mortgage loan due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\u2022U.S. gross domestic product decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% during 2020, compared to an increase of 2.2% during 2019 based on estimates.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected income earned on the underlying business. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses and mortality assumptions. The impact of improved persistency also resulted in less amortization during 2020, compared with 2019. Unlocking in 2019 was driven by a change in our withdrawal rate assumptions. The impact of unlocking interest sensitive benefit reserve assumptions during 2020, was due primarily to a revision of our expectation of policyholder utilization of the guaranteed living withdrawal benefit rider on index annuities. No unlocking was considered to be necessary for interest sensitive benefit reserves during 2019 or 2018.\nWe manage the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital (RBC) ratio, a measure of solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC based on the various risk factors related to an insurance company's capital and surplus, including insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. The insurance regulators monitor the level of RBC against a statutory authorized control level\u201d RBC at which point regulators have the option to assume control of the insurance company. The company action level RBC is 200% of the authorized control level and is the first point at which any action would be triggered. As of December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory total adjusted capital was $696.1 million, resulting in an RBC ratio of 528%, based on company action level capital of $131.8 million.\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to prior periods, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Life Insurance segment was a $3.6 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.4 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income. Excluding the impact of the voluntary early retirement program in 2018, other underwriting expenses increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to expenses associated with system enhancements and various other general expense increases associated with the growth of our business.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2019 included an asset-backed bond due to a decline in expected cash flows.\nWe operate predominantly in the life insurance industry through our principal subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life. Farm Bureau Life markets individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts to Farm Bureau members and other individuals and businesses in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States through an exclusive agency force. Other subsidiaries provide external wealth management services as well as investment management and other support services to our affiliated insurance companies. In addition, we manage two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies.\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Annuity segment was a $1.9 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.6 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income.\n\nFinancial results\n\u2022First, we discuss our business and drivers of profitability.\nWe analyze operations by reviewing financial information regarding our primary products that are aggregated in Annuity and Life Insurance product segments. In addition, our Corporate and Other segment includes our wealth management business, various support operations, corporate capital and other product lines that are not currently underwritten by the Company. We analyze our segment results based on pre-tax adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of certain items that are included in pre-tax net income. Pre-tax adjusted operating income is the same basis used for segment reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We also analyze operations using adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis, which excludes the initial impact from tax law changes. Adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis is not a measure used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of performance. We have included a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure herein. See Note 13 to our consolidated\nIn this discussion and analysis, we explain our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and where appropriate, factors that management believes may affect future performance, including:\nThe residential mortgage-backed portfolio includes government agency pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities. With a government agency pass through security, we receive a pro-rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans. CMOs consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches\u201d with varying stated maturities that provide sequential retirement of the bonds. While each tranche receives monthly interest payments, a subsequent tranche is not entitled to receive payment of principal until the entire principal of the preceding tranche is paid off. We primarily invest in sequential tranches, which allow us to manage cash flow stability and prepayment risk by the level of tranche in which we invest. In addition, to provide call protection and more stable average lives, we invest in CMOs such as planned amortization class (PAC) and targeted amortization class (TAC) securities. PAC bonds provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds and provide some protection against prepayment risk. TAC bonds provide protection from a rise in the prepayment rate due to falling interest rates. We generally do not purchase certain types of CMOs that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to excessive prepayment risk.\nRecent Accounting Changes\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nFootnotes applicable to the segment discussion that follows are as follows:\nOur exposure to interest rate risk stems from both the longevity of our life block and the interest rate sensitivity of our annuity products. We actively manage the projected cash flows, duration and key rate duration of these assets and liabilities by minimizing the difference between them. While it can be difficult to maintain asset and liability durations that are perfectly matched in a dynamic environment, we have identified various strategies that can be implemented if effective duration or key rate duration mismatches exceed acceptable tolerances.\nOur liquidity position remains strong with cash being generated by operations and financing activities. In addition, a significant portion of our liquid fixed maturity securities are in an unrealized gain position. See the Investments\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d discussions that follow.\n(9)Life insurance lapse and surrender rate represents the face amount of policyholder lapses and surrenders, incurred during the reporting period, as a percent of the simple average of related insurance in force at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The life insurance lapse and surrender rate is a measure of customer retention.\nThe other asset-backed securities are backed by both residential and non-residential collateral. The collateral for residential asset-backed securities primarily consists of second lien fixed-rate home equity loans. The cash flows of these securities are less subject to prepayment risk than residential mortgage-backed securities as the borrowers are less likely to refinance than those with only a first lien mortgage. The collateral for non-residential asset-backed securities primarily includes securities backed by credit card receivables, auto dealer receivables, auto installment loans, aircraft leases, middle market and syndicated business loans, timeshare receivables and trade and account receivables. The majority of these securities are high-quality, short-duration assets with limited cash flow variability.\n\u2022our revenues and expenses in the periods presented,\n\n\n\u2022The amount of spread (excess of net investment income earned over interest credited) we earn on contract holders' general account balances.\nDeath benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, vary from year-to-year due to changes in claim counts and average claim size. In 2020, death benefits in the Corporate and Other segment include COVID-19 related claims, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaling $2.4 million.\nMerger Agreement\nOur CLO portfolio included in other asset-backed securities is high quality, with all of the securities rated NAIC-1. Internal\n\u2022We conducted tactical sales of investments to reduce exposure to certain industries impacted by the economic downturn.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of market performance on our variable business. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to favorable market performance on our variable\n\u2022impact of these items on our overall financial condition and\nFor a portion of our business in force, we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in response to changes in portfolio yield. However, the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors and contractual guarantees. Surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial services institutions. In addition, if market rates were to stay at a low level for an extended period of time, our spread earnings could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products. See Part 1, Item 1 - Business, Business Segments for the ranges of guaranteed rates and where our products fall within those ranges.\nNet income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to changes in net realized gains/losses from investments and changes in fair value of derivatives. Net income and adjusted operating income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs from the impact of market performance on our variable business and increased earnings from an increase in the volume of business in force. These increases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by increases in death benefits and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, Merger Agreement,\u201d on January 11, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by our board of directors, FBPCIC will acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares that are not currently owned or controlled by FBPCIC or IFBF, for $56.00 per Common Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain specified closing conditions, including approval by the Company's shareholders as described in Part I, Item 1, expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, clearance by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The obtaining of financing is not a condition to the obligations of FBPCIC or Merger Sub to effect the Merger.\nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Annuity segment increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and a decrease in other underwriting expenses, partially offset by lower spread income earned. Pre-tax adjusted operating income decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower spread income earned and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions.\n(2)Amount represents the transaction expenses relating to FBL Financial Group's proposed merger transaction.\n\u2022Our ability to manage the level of our operating expenses.\n(6)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional analysis of these unrealized losses.\n\n(1)Amount represents a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the initial impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\n\nWe design our products to encourage persistency and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to help ensure targeted spreads are earned. In addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our products, certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions. Products such as supplementary contracts with life contingencies are not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal. Depending on the product, surrender charge rates on annuity contracts range up to 10.0% and surrender charge periods range up to 10 years and typically decrease 1.0% to 2.0% for every year the contract is in force.\n\nIf interest rates had increased 10% from levels at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments would have decreased approximately $75.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $123.2 million at December 31, 2019. These hypothetical changes in value do not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value for a portion of the underlying contracts.\n\u2022We earn mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts at annual rates ranging from 0% to 1.45% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. As a result, revenues from these sources fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the equity, fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, stockholders' equity was impacted by capital deployment actions during 2020. We paid a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share on our common stock and increased our regular quarterly common stock dividend by 4.2% to $0.50 per share.\n\u2022Collected annuity premium decreased to $182.3 million during 2020, compared to $252.0 million collected during 2019. These decreases were attributable to COVID-19 through fewer sales opportunities, decreased interest crediting rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nResults for 2018 were unfavorably impacted by the correction of an immaterial error related to a closed block of interest sensitive whole life business. The immaterial error arose and accumulated over several years, with none of those previous years being materially impacted. Remediation required an adjustment to existing in force business account values as well as adjustment to benefit payments for terminated business. The correction resulted in a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million, consisting of $3.5 million related to delayed benefit payments and $2.0 million of accrued interest. The change in estimate and accrued interest resulted in an increase to 2018 interest sensitive product benefits interest credited of $2.0 million, interest sensitive death benefits of $3.3 million and traditional life future policy benefits of $0.2 million.\nState and Political Subdivision Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products, such as ordinary annuities and universal life insurance, are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses. Our insurance subsidiaries receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. For index products, proceeds from call options are earned from a portion of the funds deposited, which are passed through to the contract holders in the form of index credits. Index credits and interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022We also have equity price risk related to index product reserves related to guarantee living withdrawal benefits.\n\nState and political subdivision securities totaled $1,416.0 million, or 17.1% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020, and $1,477.2 million, or 19.2% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2019, and include investments in general obligation, revenue and municipal housing bonds. Our investment strategy is to utilize municipal bonds in addition to corporate bonds, as we believe they provide additional diversification and have historically low default rates compared with similarly rated corporate bonds. We evaluate the credit strength of the underlying issues on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, excluding insurance, prior to acquisition. The majority of the municipal bonds we hold are investment grade credits without consideration of insurance. Our municipal bonds are well diversified by type and geography with the top exposure being water and sewer revenue bonds. Our municipal bond holdings were trading at 115.3% of amortized cost at December 31, 2020. We do not hold any Puerto Rico-related bonds. Exposure to the state of Illinois and municipalities within the state accounted for 1.1% of our total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our Illinois-related portfolio holdings were rated investment grade and were valued at 119.4% of amortized cost.\n\u2022Our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns while providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and minimizing the risk of defaults or impairments of invested assets.\nCredit Risk\n\nDeath benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, vary from year-to-year due to changes in claim counts and average claim size. In 2020, death benefits in the Life Insurance segment include COVID-19 related claims, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaling $8.8 million.\n\u2022Actual experience and changes in assumptions for expected surrender and withdrawal rates, mortality and spreads used in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nNet income in 2020, compared to 2019, was negatively impacted by changes in net realized gains/losses from investments, the change in fair value of derivatives and expenses incurred during 2020 related to the proposed Merger. Net income and adjusted operating income decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, primarily due to COVID-19, the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets. These decreases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by an increase in equity income and a reduction in other underwriting expenses and a benefit from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nThe models used to estimate the impact of a 10% change in market interest rates utilize many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations. Key assumptions in the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset-backed securities. The above estimates do not attempt to measure the financial statement impact on the resulting change in deferred acquisition costs, unearned revenue reserves, policyholder liabilities and income taxes. Due to the subjectivity of these assumptions, the actual impact of a 10% change in rates on the fair values would likely be different from that estimated.\n\u2022Our profitability would be impacted if there were little or no gains in the entire series of options purchased over the expected life of an indexed product, as we would incur expenses for credited interest over and above our option costs.\n\u2022Our ability to price our life insurance products to earn acceptable margins over the cost of providing benefits and the expenses of acquiring and administering the products. Competitive conditions, mortality experience, persistency, benefit utilization, investment results and our ability to maintain expenses in accordance with pricing assumptions drive our margins on the life products. On many products, we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a summary of fixed maturities by contractual maturity date.\n\u2022The amount by which bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage- and asset-backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates or decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates.\n\u2022The volume of our life insurance and annuity business in force, which is driven by the level of our sales and the persistency of the business written.\n(1)Equivalent ratings are based on those provided by nationally recognized rating agencies with some exceptions for certain residential mortgage, commercial mortgage- and asset-backed securities that are based on the expected loss of the security rather than the probability of default. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the equivalent credit rating.\n\nA major component of our asset-liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the expected cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities. We use models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios. Information from these models is used in the determination of investment strategies. Effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It measures the approximate percentage change in the fair value of a portfolio when interest rates change by 100 basis points at all points on the curve. Key rate duration is a bifurcation of the effective duration that measures the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates within two points on a curve. These measures include the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments. When the estimated effective durations of assets and liabilities are similar, exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities.\nFarm Bureau Life's cash inflows primarily consist of premiums, deposits to policyholder account balances, income from investments, sales, maturities and calls of investments; and repayments of investment principal. Farm Bureau Life's cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyholder account balances, investment purchases and payment of policy acquisition costs, policyholder benefits, income taxes, current operating expenses and dividends. Life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow that may be measured by the degree to which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred. The remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business. Continuing operations and financing activities from Farm Bureau Life relating to interest sensitive products provided funds totaling $286.1 million in 2020, $235.5 million in 2019 and $268.9 million in 2018.\nEquity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses attributable to our ownership interest in partnerships, joint ventures and certain companies over which we exhibit some control but have a minority ownership interest. We consistently use the most recent financial information available to account for equity income. Several of these entities are investment companies whose operating results are derived primarily from unrealized and realized gains and losses generated by their investment portfolios.\nThe level of realized gains (losses) is subject to fluctuation from period to period due to the timing of investment sales and credit losses, changes in the carrying value of investments held at fair value as well as changes in allowances for credit losses. See Financial Condition - Investments\u201d and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for details regarding our unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note decreased to 0.93% at December 31, 2020 from 1.92% at December 31, 2019.\nFor variable universal life and variable annuities, premiums received are not reported as revenues. Similar to universal life and ordinary annuities, revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders. Expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances.\n(8)Includes prepayment fee income and adjustments to the amortization of premium or discounts from changes in our payment speed assumptions on mortgage and other asset-backed securities.\n(1)Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Since accumulated other comprehensive income fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of investments caused principally by changes in market interest rates, we believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information.\nManagement took several actions to address these challenges.\n\u2022expected sources and uses of cash.\nThe following are key measures which partially illustrate the impact from COVID-19 on the economy:\n\nStockholders' Equity\ninsurance products are competitive within the marketplace or for contractual reasons in the case of products earning guaranteed rates, will result in lower earnings.\n(2)Amount represents the transaction expenses relating to FBL Financial Group's proposed merger transaction.\nOur profitability is primarily a factor of:\nEquity Income\n(5)Annualized average crediting rates consist of annualized interest credited and index credits applied to policyholders during the reporting period, along with amortization of call option costs and proceeds from sales or maturing call options associated with the call options that back our indexed products as a percentage of the simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning of the reporting period and end of the reporting period, adjusted for interest credited during the period. Annualized average crediting rates along with annualized average investment yields provides a view of spread margin earned on the underlying products.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the U.S. economy during 2020. Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 the United States experienced significant economic disruption as businesses closed and consumer access to goods and services became limited due to regulated or voluntary quarantine measures. As a result, the financial markets reacted negatively, impacting corporate liquidity and market interest rates. After the initial shock, the U.S. economy improved with the aid of significant economic stimulus measures, resulting in the stabilization of financial markets.\nMortgage and Asset-Backed Securities\nWe have exposure to credit risk as it relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given entity to make timely payments of principal and interest. See Financial Condition - Investments\u201d for additional information about credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 96.1% (based on carrying value) of the available-for-sale fixed maturities were investment grade debt securities, defined as being in the highest two National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) designations. Non-investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers. In addition, the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for investment grade debt securities. We regularly review the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in non-investment grade debt securities (NAIC designations 3 through 6). As of December 31, 2020, no single non-investment grade holding exceeded 0.2% of total investments.\nOur business generally benefits from moderate to strong economic expansion. Conversely, a lackluster economy characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, muted corporate earnings growth and lower business investment could adversely impact the demand for our products in the future. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims, lapses or surrenders of policies during such times. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFinancial position\nThe mortgage- and asset-backed securities can be summarized into three broad categories: residential, commercial and other asset-backed securities.\n(6)Average aggregate individual annuity account value is a measure used to monitor business growth in our individual fixed and indexed annuity product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are primarily sequential securities. CMBS typically have cash flows that are less subject to refinance risk than residential mortgage-backed securities principally due to prepayment restrictions on many of the underlying commercial mortgage loans.\nOur profitability is also impacted by changes in accounting guidance that affect the timing of profit recognition. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for details on adopted and pending accounting pronouncements.\nInvestments\nThe repayment pattern on mortgage and other asset-backed securities is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities because the repayment terms are tied to underlying debt obligations that are subject to prepayments. The prepayment speeds (e.g., the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages) can vary based on a number of economic factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. These factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy.\nResults of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2020\nInterest Rate Risk\nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Corporate and Other segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in expenses and amortization of deferred acquisition costs driven by the impact of market performance on our variable business and a decrease in net investment income, partially offset by an increase in equity income. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Corporate and Other segment decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs driven by the impact of market performance on our variable business, partially offset by the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and increases in expenses and death benefits.\nFarm Bureau Life's ability to pay dividends to the parent company is limited by law to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus) as of the date the dividend is paid, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the State of Iowa. At December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory unassigned surplus was $494.6 million. There are certain additional limits on the amount of dividends that may be paid within a year without approval of the Insurance Division, Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the Iowa Insurance Division) as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. During 2021, the maximum amount legally available for distribution to the parent company without further regulatory approval is $87.4 million. Timing of such dividends during the year is limited based on the timing of dividends paid within the preceding 12 months.\nOur stockholders' equity increased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to the change in unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities during the period and net income, partially offset by dividends paid.\nA prolonged period of low interest rates may result in increased downward pressure on average earned yields for the investment portfolios supporting our annuity and universal life business as higher-yielding fixed maturity securities and mortgages are sold, mature or are prepaid and replaced with lower-yielding investments. Lower investment income may cause us to lower crediting rates on our spread-based annuity and life insurance products, which in turn may reduce their attractiveness to potential customers. Failure to lower crediting rates as portfolio investment yields decline, either by choice, to ensure our spread-based\nIncome taxes on adjustments to net income have been recorded at 21% in 2019 and 2018 as there are no permanent differences between book and taxable income relating to these adjustments. In 2020, there is no income tax offset attributable to the proposed acquisition transaction expenses, as they are not deductible for income tax purposes. Also in 2020, the income tax offset attributable to realized gains (losses) includes an additional tax benefit of $0.3 million related to capital losses expected to be carried back to 2017 when the income tax rate was 35%. Income taxes on all other 2020 adjustments to net income have been recorded at 21%.\n\n\u2022changes in revenues and expenses between periods,\nAt each balance sheet date, we review and update our expectation of future prepayment speeds and the book value of the mortgage and other asset-backed securities purchased at a premium or discount is reset, if needed. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for more detail on accounting for the amortization of premium and accrual of discount on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.\nWe periodically revise key assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance in force acquired, deferred sales inducements, unearned revenue reserve for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products, as applicable, through an unlocking\u201d process. These assumptions typically consist of withdrawal and lapse rates, rider utilization, earned spreads and mortality with revisions based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. The impact of unlocking is recorded in the current period as an increase or decrease to amortization of the respective balances. While the unlocking process can take place at any time, as needs dictate, the process typically takes place during the third quarter. See the discussion that follows for further details of the unlocking impact on our results in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe CDR is the constant default rate (annually) that a CLO must suffer before our tranche takes its first dollar loss.\nOverview and Profitability\n\n(7)Individual annuity withdrawal rate represents withdrawal benefits incurred during the reporting period, excluding internal exchanges, as a percent of the simple average of related policy reserves at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The individual annuity withdrawal rate is a measure customer retention.\n\u2022As the economic downturn and lack of consumer mobility put strain on certain issuers, net realized capital losses and the change in allowance for credit losses totaled $16.3 million during 2020 compared to net realized capital gains including other-than-temporary impairment losses of $7.6 million during 2019. The majority of these losses were incurred during the first quarter 2020.\nLiquidity\nWe also include within our analysis premiums collected,\u201d another measure that is not used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of agent productivity. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding this measure and its relationship to GAAP revenues.\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding how we define our segments and pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nin force. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Life Insurance segment increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and the impact from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nThe annualized yield on average invested assets for individual annuities decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior periods, primarily due to lower yields on new investment acquisitions from premium receipts and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing investments, compared with the average existing portfolio yield. The decrease in 2020, compared to 2019, was partially offset by higher other investment-related income while we recognized a decrease in other investment-related income in 2019 compared to 2018. See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to crediting and cap rate actions taken in 2020 in response to a declining portfolio yield and a change in our mix of business in force, partially offset by increased amortization of call option costs supporting our index annuity products. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs.\nParent company cash inflows from operations consist primarily of fees that it charges various subsidiaries and affiliates for management of their operations, expense reimbursements and tax settlements from subsidiaries and affiliates, investment income and dividends from subsidiaries, if declared and paid. Revenue sources for the parent company during 2020 included management fees from subsidiaries and affiliates totaling $7.9 million and dividends of $98.5 million. Cash outflows are principally for salaries, taxes and other expenses related to providing management services, dividends on outstanding stock, stock repurchases and interest on our parent company debt.\n\n Balance Sheet Caption Description of Critical Estimate Assumptions / Approach Used Effect if Different Assumptions / Approach Used Other assets/liabilities The determination of net periodic pension cost and related accrued/prepaid pension expense requires the use of estimates as to the expected return on plan assets, discount rate on plan liabilities and other accrual assumptions. Pension expense for 2020 totaled $4.1 million. To determine our net periodic pension costs for 2020, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.85% and a discount rate of 3.37%. Details regarding the method used to determine the discount rate are summarized in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The long-term rate of return may fluctuate over time based on asset mix and if investment returns over a long period of time significantly differ from historical returns. The discount rate changes annually as it is based on current yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension obligations. As fluctuations in the expected long-term rate of return and discount rate have been historically moderate and we have no current plans to change our investment strategy significantly, we believe a change of up to 100 basis points is reasonably likely. A 100 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would result in a $1.2 million increase in pension expense and a 100 basis point increase would result in a $1.2 million decrease to pension expense. A 100 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would result in a $2.7 million increase in pension expense while a 100 basis point increase would result in a $2.4 million decrease to pension expense. The information above is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future changes in the long-term rate of return or discount rates. Deferred income taxes The amount of deferred tax assets we hold is dependent on our estimate of the future deductibility of certain items. A valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. No valuation allowance was recorded on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020. We utilize tax planning strategies, which require forward-looking assumptions and management judgment, to determine the deductibility of certain items and to assess the need for a valuation allowance. During periods in which we have deferred tax assets related to unrealized investment losses, we utilize tax planning strategies, including a buy-and-hold investment philosophy for securities experiencing unrealized losses and the sale of appreciated securities to ensure the deductibility of such losses in future periods. At December 31, 2020, we held gross deferred tax assets totaling $45.0 million, primarily related to future policy benefits, employee benefits and loss carryforwards. Utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on our future earnings. No valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets, as we believe future earnings will be sufficient to ensure their utilization. If future earnings are no longer expected to be sufficient, a valuation allowance will need to be established. Given the number of variables that impact the level of future earnings, it is not practicable to estimate a range of possible outcomes to the valuation of the deferred tax assets. Future changes in tax rates and other tax laws may also impact the utilization of deferred tax assets. \nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Life Insurance segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, partially offset by reduced other underwriting expenses and a benefit from the impact of an increase in the volume of business\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting estimates and the hypothetical effects of changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate, are included in the following table. We have discussed the identification, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n(3)The items excluded from adjusted operating income impact the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserve. Certain interest sensitive reserves as well as income taxes are also impacted.\nCash Flows\n\n\n\u2022Changes in the fair value of our equity securities are reported in earnings.\n\u2022We have equity price risk to the extent we may owe amounts under the guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit provisions of our variable annuity contracts. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional discussion of these provisions.", "item_7_text": "\u2022The amortization of deferred acquisition costs on our variable business can fluctuate with changes in the performance of the underlying separate accounts. See the Corporate and Other Segment discussion above for additional discussion of this amortization.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to normal fluctuations in timing of payments made and received. Deferred acquisition costs decreased during the same period primarily due to a $120.2 million increase in the impact of the change in net unrealized appreciation on fixed maturity securities during the period. Other assets decreased during the same period primarily due to the impact of amortization of LIHTC investments. Assets and liabilities held in separate accounts increased during the same period due to market performance on the underlying investment portfolios.\n\n\nThe annualized yield on average invested assets for interest sensitive life insurance products decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to lower yields on new investment acquisitions from premium receipts and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing investments, compared with the average existing portfolio yield and lower other investment-related income. See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our interest sensitive life insurance products increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs supporting our indexed universal life products and a change in the mix of business.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected profits on the underlying business, which included increased mortality in 2020. Amortization, as well as reserves held on certain interest sensitive products, also changed due to the impact of unlocking. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses, premium persistency and mortality assumptions. The 2020 unlocking charge was primarily due to updating our assumptions related to spread income, with the expectation of lower market interest rates than previously assumed. During 2019, unlocking also included the extension of the deferred acquisition cost amortization period for our participating whole life insurance business based on an increase in persistency rates.\n(1)Amount represents a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other items impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\n(10)Average aggregate interest sensitive account value is a measure used to monitor business volume of our variable universal life and variable annuity product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n\n\u2022We then describe the business environment in which we operate including factors that affect operating results.\nOur investment portfolio increased 6.5% to $9,684.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $9,091.6 million at December 31, 2019. The portfolio increase is primarily due to a $421.9 million increase in the net unrealized appreciation of fixed maturities. The increase in unrealized appreciation is the result of a decrease in market interest rates driven by a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates. Additional details regarding securities in an unrealized gain or loss position at December 31, 2020 are included in the discussion that follows and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Details regarding investment allowances/impairments are discussed above in the Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments\u201d section under Results of Operations.\u201d\nDuring 2020, our operating activities generated cash flows totaling $229.1 million, consisting of net income of $72.3 million adjusted for non-cash operating revenues and expenses netting to $156.8 million. We used cash of $197.7 million in our investing activities during 2020. The primary uses were $914.0 million of investment acquisitions, mostly in fixed maturity securities, partially offset by $778.5 million in sales, maturities and repayments of investments. Our financing activities used cash of $35.9 million during 2020. The primary financing source was $630.5 million in receipts from interest sensitive products credited to policyholder account balances, offset by $570.1 million for return of policyholder account balances on interest sensitive products and $86.2 million for dividends paid to stockholders. Funding agreements with the FHLB represent $264.5 million of receipts from interest sensitive products and $180.0 million of return of policyholder account balances.\nWe manage the investment portfolio to optimize risk-adjusted yield within the context of prudent asset-liability management. We evaluate multiple cash flow testing scenarios as part of this process. The Company's investment policy calls for investing primarily in high-quality fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans.\n Balance Sheet Caption Description of Critical Estimate Assumptions / Approach Used Effect if Different Assumptions / Approach Used Fixed maturities - available for sale Excluding U.S. Government treasury securities, very few of our fixed maturity securities trade on the balance sheet date. For those securities without a trade on the balance sheet date, fair values are determined using valuation processes that require judgment. Fair values are obtained primarily from a variety of independent pricing sources, whose results we evaluate internally. Details regarding valuation techniques and processes are summarized in Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale had a fair value of $8,283.7 million, with gross unrealized gains totaling $1,123.2 million and gross unrealized losses totaling $14.0 million. Due to the large number of fixed maturity securities held, the unique attributes of each security and the complexity of valuation methods, it is not practical to estimate a potential range of fair values for different assumptions and methods that could be used in the valuation process. Fixed maturities - available for sale We are required to exercise judgment to determine to what extent an unrealized loss is due to credit and establish an allowance for credit losses on a security. Whether a realized loss needs to be recognized in earnings and the amount of the loss primarily depends on whether (1) a decline in fair value is credit related, (2) our intent to sell the security and (3) whether or not we could be required to sell prior to recovery. The amortized cost is not adjusted by the loss reported in earnings if the decline is credit related and the resulting allowance can increase or decrease between reporting periods. If we have the intent to sell the security or we could be required to sell the security prior to recovery the previous amortized cost is adjusted by the loss reported in earnings to provide a new cost basis for the fixed maturity security. We evaluate the operating results of the underlying issuer, near-term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, causes for the decline in value, and other key economic measures and our intent to sell and whether or not we would be required to sell prior to recovery. At December 31, 2020, we had $18.8 million of gross unrealized losses, on which we have established an allowance for credit losses of $4.9 million. The allowance for credit losses we have recorded at December 31, 2020 was established at the fair value of the underlying investments, accordingly this would represent the maximum potential loss for those investments. The allowance represents our best estimate of potential losses across the fixed maturity portfolio. Our maximum additional loss exposure would be $13.9 million which represents the total unrealized portfolio losses not subject to an allowance for credit losses. Details regarding these securities are included in the Financial Condition - Investments\u201d section above. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we believe that all credit allowance losses within the portfolio have been recognized. \nDuring 2020, the company adopted new accounting guidance for the accounting for credit impairments of certain financial instruments. Under the new guidance, credit losses are required to be estimated using an expected loss model under which an allowance for credit losses is established and reflected as a charge to earnings. This change and other accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted are discussed further in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\n\u2022Product actions were taken to improve profitability.\n(11)Amounts represent the estimated effect of market performance of policyholder funds invested in the separate accounts on actual and expected profits and the related impact on the value of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserve.\nIncome Taxes on Adjusted Operating Income\n\nContractual Obligations\nWe paid regular cash dividends on our common and preferred stock totaling $49.2 million in 2020, $47.5 million in 2019 and $45.8 million in 2018. In addition, we paid a special $1.50 per common share cash dividend in March 2020, March 2019 and March 2018 totaling $37.0 million, $37.0 million, and $37.3 million, respectively. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company is permitted to declare and pay, and has agreed to declare and pay, quarterly cash dividends of $0.52 per share of common stock. We will also pay the quarterly cash dividend of $0.0075 per Series B redeemable preferred share. The common stock dividend rates are analyzed quarterly and are dependent upon our capital and liquidity positions. In addition, alternative uses of excess capital may impact future dividend levels. Assuming these quarterly dividend rates, the common and preferred dividends would total approximately $50.9 million in 2021. The parent company expects to have sufficient resources and cash flows to meet its interest and dividend payments throughout 2021. The parent company had available cash and investments totaling $44.2 million at December 31, 2020. The parent company expects to rely on available cash resources, dividends from Farm Bureau Life and management fee income to make dividend payments to its stockholders, interest payments on its debt and to fund any capital initiatives such as stock repurchases. In addition, our parent company and Farm Bureau Life have entered into a reciprocal line of credit arrangement, which provides additional liquidity for either entity up to $20.0 million. We had no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2020.\n\n(8)Average aggregate interest sensitive life account value is a measure used to monitor business growth in our universal life product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n\u2022The average life of the portfolio.\nMortgage Loans\n\nThe table above summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the first-call\u201d date. For non-callable bonds, the first-call date is always the maturity date. The weighted-average life is calculated using scheduled pay-downs and expected prepayments for amortizing securities. For non-amortizing securities, the weighted-average life is equal to the stated maturity date.\nFuture policy benefits increased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to an increase in the volume of life business in force. Deferred income taxes increased during the same period primarily due to the tax impact of the change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments.\n(3)Includes prepayment fee income and adjustments to the amortization of premium or discounts from changes in our payment speed assumptions on mortgage and other asset-backed securities.\n(7)Amounts represent the estimated effect of market performance of policyholder funds invested in the separate accounts on the value of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserve, net of tax.\n(3)Amounts are net of adjustments, as applicable, to amortization of unearned revenue reserves and deferred acquisition costs, as well as changes in interest sensitive product reserves and income taxes attributable to these items.\nFBL Operations\n(1) The CMBS portfolio included government agency-backed securities with a carrying value of $911.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $845.5 million at December 31, 2019. Also included in the CMBS portfolio are military housing bonds totaling $170.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $163.9 million at December 31, 2019. These bonds are used to fund the construction of multi-family homes on United States military bases. The bonds are backed by a first mortgage lien on residential military housing projects.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, we have periodically taken advantage of opportunities to repurchase our outstanding Class A common stock through Class A common stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors. There was $26.3 million remaining for repurchases at December 31, 2020, under the current $50 million Class A common stock repurchase program. Completion of this program is dependent on market conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the exact timing of any repurchases or the number of shares that we will repurchase. The share repurchase program may be modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. Under the Merger Agreement, we have agreed not to repurchase any additional shares of our capital stock from the date of the Merger Agreement through the closing of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, including pursuant to our equity awards plans. We repurchased 290,144 shares of Class A common stock for $10.0 million in 2020, 66,475 shares of Class A common stock for $4.6 million in 2019 and 232,837 shares of stock Class A common stock for $15.9 million in 2018.\nOn a consolidated basis, we anticipate that funds to meet our short-term and long-term contractual obligations, capital expenditures, cash dividends to stockholders and operating cash needs will come from existing capital and internally-generated funds. We manage our investment portfolio to provide cash flows needed for policyholder obligations in the normal course of business as discussed in the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section above. However, there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since benefits and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment, our financial strength ratings, the economy and other factors that impact policyholder behavior. Farm Bureau Life is a member of the FHLB, which provides a source for additional liquidity if needed. This membership allows us to utilize fixed or floating rate advances offered by the FHLB and secured by qualifying collateral. Our total capacity to utilize such advances is impacted by multiple factors including the market value of eligible collateral, our level of statutory admitted assets and excess reserves and our willingness or capacity to hold activity-based FHLB common stock.\n Balance Sheet Caption Description of Critical Estimate Assumptions / Approach Used Effect if Different Assumptions / Approach Used Deferred acquisition costs Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of future gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: - amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force, - yield on investments supporting the liabilities, - amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, - amount of policy fees and charges and - amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies. Estimates used in the calculation of amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which are revised at least annually, are based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is expected to total approximately $27.2 million for 2021, excluding the impact of new production in 2021. Based upon a historical analysis of fluctuations in estimated gross profits, we believe it is reasonably likely that a 10% change in estimated gross profits could occur. A 10% increase in estimated gross profits for 2021 would result in $2.0 million of additional amortization expense. Correspondingly, a 10% decrease in estimated gross profits would result in a $2.0 million reduction of amortization expense. The information above is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future changes in estimated gross profits. Future policy benefits Reserving for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the policies, mortality experience, lapse rates, surrender rates and dividend crediting rates. These assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of products, these assumptions are generally held constant. Due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of traditional life insurance reserves, it is not practical to perform a sensitivity analysis on the impact of reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions. The cost of performing detailed calculations using different assumption scenarios outweighs the benefit that would be derived. We believe our assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. \nPremium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits.\n\u2022We incurred death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, with COVID-19 reported as a cause of death totaling $11.2 million during 2020.\nThe costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally commissions), defined as deferred acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. We also record an asset, value of insurance in force acquired, for the cost assigned to insurance contracts when an insurance company is acquired. For nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in\u201d at the date the policies are issued. For participating traditional life insurance and interest sensitive products, these costs are generally amortized in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. This amortization is periodically adjusted or unlocked when we revise key assumptions used in the calculation. For example, deferred acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity.\n(1)Premiums collected is a non-GAAP measure of sales production, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\nWe monitor the financial condition and operations of the issuers of securities rated below investment grade and of the issuers of certain investment grade securities for which we have concerns regarding credit quality that could potentially require a credit allowance. See additional details regarding write downs and our methodology for evaluating investments for credit allowance in Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\n(1)Amount represents a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other items impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\nOur capital position remains strong, with Farm Bureau Life's company action level risk-based capital ratio was 528% at December 31, 2020.\nSources and Uses of Capital Resources\nPension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and/or discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The December 31, 2020 pension obligation was computed based on an average 2.68% discount rate, which was based on yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. The long-term return on plan assets is based on current and projected asset allocations. Declines in comparable bond and equity yields would decrease our net pension asset.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, described in Part I, Item 1. Business, Merger Agreement,\u201d we are required to pay a termination fee of up to $18.5 million, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, and reimburse the out-of-pocket expenses of FBPCIC, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates up to a maximum of $5.3 million, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances.\nA portion of the securities acquired during 2020 and 2019 were acquired with the proceeds from advances on our funding agreements with the FHLB. The securities acquired to support these funding agreements often carry a lower average yield than securities acquired to support our other insurance products, due to the shorter maturity and relatively low interest rate paid on those advances. In addition, certain municipal securities acquired are exempt from federal income taxes, and accordingly have a higher actual return than reflected in the yields stated above. The average yield of the securities acquired, excluding the securities supporting the funding agreements and using a tax-adjusted yield for the municipal securities, was 3.39% in 2020 and 3.84% in 2019.\nThe level of gains and losses for these entities normally fluctuates from period to period depending on the prevailing economic environment, changes in the value of underlying investments held by the investment partnerships, the timing and success of initial public offerings or exit strategies, and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures. Equity income, net of related taxes was $5.9 million in 2020, $3.5 million in 2019 and $4.4 million in 2018. Equity income included in the Corporate segment in 2020 includes a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million from one transaction in an investment partnership.

Average invested assets are used in the calculation of the annualized investment yield.\n\n\nstress testing has indicated that the weighted average constant default rate (CDR) of our portfolio without suffering loss is 17%.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into insurance contracts, financing transactions, lease agreements or other commitments that are necessary or beneficial to our operations. These commitments may obligate us to certain cash flows during future periods. Our policyholder obligations are our largest contractual obligations. The differences between contractual obligations and the balance sheet values of our insurance liabilities are primarily the accumulation of interest and death benefits in excess of related policyholder reserves.\n\n\u2022We highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen reading the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this report. Unless noted otherwise, all references to FBL Financial Group, Inc. (we or the Company) include all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (Farm Bureau Life) and Greenfields Life Insurance Company.\nwithdrawal rate increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to certain policies reaching the end of their interest rate guarantee period and the competitiveness of our current crediting rates relative to other financial products.\nMerger Agreement\n\u2022We incurred a pre-tax unlocking charge of $6.7 million during 2020, driven largely by a $13.1 million pre-tax charge associated with an expectation of lower future investment portfolio interest rates.\n\u2022Expense management was a focus, which partially offset the pandemic's financial impact.\n\nInterest payments on our debt totaled $4.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Interest payments on our debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 are estimated to be $4.9 million in 2021.\nMortgage loans totaled $994.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $1,011.7 million at December 31, 2019. Our mortgage loans are diversified as to property type, location and loan size, and are collateralized by the related properties. The total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding was 212 at December 31, 2020 and 209 at December 31, 2019. In 2020, new loans ranged from $2.8 million to $15.0 million in size, with an average loan size of $6.1 million, an average loan term of 15 years and an average net yield of 3.37%. Our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type. The majority of our mortgage loans amortize principal, with 2.1% that are interest-only loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the average loan-to-value of the current outstanding principal balance using the most recent appraised value was 49.9% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.7 based on the results of our 2019 annual study. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our mortgage loans.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA majority of our insurance liabilities are backed by fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. The weighted average life of the fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolio, based on fair values, was approximately 11.0 years at December 31, 2020 and 11.3 years at December 31, 2019. Accordingly, the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. The extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors:\nMarket Risks of Financial Instruments\n(2)Average invested assets, including applicable investments held as securities and indebtedness of related parties and cash equivalents, is the average of investment balances at the beginning of the reporting period and as of the end of each quarter throughout the reporting period. Average invested assets are used in the calculation of the annualized investment yield.\nThe table above summarizes cash inflows from the maturity or prepayment of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans that will be available for benefits or reinvestment. These cash flow estimates are based on our existing investment holdings and do not anticipate the effect of new acquisitions or voluntary sales of these securities. The estimates include assumptions for the timing of paydowns on asset-backed and other securities, and accordingly, may not represent actual amounts that will be received during the periods presented or changes to these assumptions during the year. In a declining or low interest rate environment, prepayments and redemptions affecting our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loan investments may increase as issuers and borrowers seek to refinance at a lower rate.\nImpact of Recent Business Environment\n\nWe have organized our discussion and analysis as follows:\n\nLower fixed maturity interest rates driven by lower U.S. Treasury interest rates resulted in an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities during 2020. The increase in fair value of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, resulted in an increase in our book value per common share to $69.24 at December 31, 2020 from $60.12 at December 31, 2019.\nInterest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and fair value of investments. The yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. The fair value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase.\n\nDeath and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits.\nFor a majority of our products, profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and interest crediting rates on our insurance liabilities. For index products, profitability on the portion of the policyholders' account balance allocated to an index option is generally determined as the difference between interest yields on investments and the cost of call options. For variable annuities and variable universal life policies, profitability on the portion of the policyholder's account balance invested in the fixed general account option, if any, is also affected by the spreads earned. For the variable products, the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts.\n\u2022We then review the results of operations beginning with an overview of the total Company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment.\nOur direct exposure to the Alt-A home equity and subprime first-lien sectors is limited to investments in structured securities collateralized by senior tranches of residential mortgage loans. We also have a partnership interest in one fund at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, that owns securities backed by Alt-A home equity, subprime first-lien and adjustable rate mortgage collateral. The fund is reported as securities and indebtedness of related parties in our consolidated balance sheets with a fair value of $0.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2019. We do not own any direct investments in subprime lenders.\n(4)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n\nWe believe COVID-19 and the impact it had on our economy contributed to the following financial results during 2020:\nOther income and other expenses include fees and expenses from sales of brokered products and operating results of our non-insurance subsidiaries, including wealth management services, advisory, management and leasing activities. Other income and other expenses increased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to expanding our wealth management business. The expansion of our wealth management business has increased administrative costs along with the costs of implementing a new delivery platform to allow for additional product offerings and an enhanced customer experience. Revenues associated with our wealth management expansion have increased modestly as we continue to expand this business increasing to $4.6 million in 2020 compared to $2.2 million in 2019 and $0.5 million in 2018. Expenses, including commissions, associated with our wealth management expansion have increased to $11.1 million during 2020 compared to $7.1 million in 2019 and $3.4 million in 2018. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees resulting in a $1.1 million increase in other expenses in the Corporate and Other segment.\nEquity price risk is limited due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at December 31, 2020. However, we are exposed to equity price risk in the following ways:\n\n(4)Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of earnings, see Overview section above for additional information.\n\u2022U.S. unemployment increased to 6.7% at December 31, 2020 based on estimates, compared to 3.5% at December 31, 2019.\nEquity Risk\nThe average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force decreased slightly in 2020, compared to 2019, as withdrawals and surrenders exceeded annuity premiums. The average aggregate account value for individual annuity contracts in force increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to continued sales and the crediting of interest. Growth in our indexed annuity business in force continues to drive increases in interest sensitive product charges. Premiums collected decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to decreased sales of our fixed rate deferred and indexed annuity products, as sales were negatively impacted by crediting and cap rate reductions in response to declining portfolio yields. Individual fixed rate deferred annuity collected premiums were $82.8 million in 2020, $118.6 million in 2019 and $139.0 million in 2018. Indexed annuity collected premiums were $93.2 million in 2020, $128.2 million in 2019 and $137.6 million in 2018. To increase spread income given lower fixed and indexed annuity sales, we increased the issuance of funding agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) during 2020. Outstanding funding agreements with FHLB, which are included in policyholder liabilities, totaled $585.2 million at December 31, 2020, $488.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $446.0 million at December 31, 2018.\n\u2022sources of earnings and changes in stockholders' equity,\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted operating income was 13.7% for 2020, 13.6% for 2019 and 13.9% for 2018. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments and tax-exempt investment income. The effective rate for 2019 also differs from the federal statutory rate due to non-recurring tax benefits of $2.5 million resulting from the execution of a tax planning strategy to adjust our tax-basis policy reserves. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information on income taxes.\n\u2022Finally, we discuss critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards. The critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult or complex judgment.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-discretionary products primarily represent funding agreements, guaranteed investment contracts and supplementary contracts involving life contingencies for which we do not have the ability to adjust crediting rates.\n\nbusiness, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Unlocking generally reflects changes in projected earned spreads, separate account performance and withdrawal and mortality assumptions.\nMortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are purchased when we believe these types of investments provide superior risk-adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans. These securities are diversified as to collateral types, cash flow characteristics and maturity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created several operational challenges during 2020. Our initial focus was to quickly transition to working at home, safeguarding employees and reducing the risk of business interruption. Social distancing impacted our sales process between our agents and client/members. The launch of our accelerated underwriting process during the third quarter 2020, led to some processing delays with a third-party provider, which the vendor attributed to be partially due to COVID-19. We took action to address the delays for our client/members and worked with the vendor to remediate the accelerated underwriting process.\nFinancial Condition\nThe change in allowance for credit losses in the finance sector reflects two fixed maturity securities with an allowance established as the difference of the investments' amortized cost and fair value. The improvement in the mortgage loan allowance for credit losses primarily reflects a reduction in mortgage loan investments since December 31, 2019, as well as improvement in the loss factors used to estimate the allowance. See Note 2 Investment Operations\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the allowance for credit losses.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2018 included an energy sector bond due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, an asset backed security due to concerns regarding the company's recovery plan, and a construction sector bond due to a missed bond payment. We also increased our valuation allowance on a mortgage loan due to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\u2022U.S. gross domestic product decreased at an annual rate of 3.5% during 2020, compared to an increase of 2.2% during 2019 based on estimates.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements changed in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to unlocking actuarial assumptions and changes in actual and expected income earned on the underlying business. Unlocking generally reflects changes in our projected earned spreads, policy lapses and mortality assumptions. The impact of improved persistency also resulted in less amortization during 2020, compared with 2019. Unlocking in 2019 was driven by a change in our withdrawal rate assumptions. The impact of unlocking interest sensitive benefit reserve assumptions during 2020, was due primarily to a revision of our expectation of policyholder utilization of the guaranteed living withdrawal benefit rider on index annuities. No unlocking was considered to be necessary for interest sensitive benefit reserves during 2019 or 2018.\nWe manage the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital (RBC) ratio, a measure of solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC based on the various risk factors related to an insurance company's capital and surplus, including insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. The insurance regulators monitor the level of RBC against a statutory authorized control level\u201d RBC at which point regulators have the option to assume control of the insurance company. The company action level RBC is 200% of the authorized control level and is the first point at which any action would be triggered. As of December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory total adjusted capital was $696.1 million, resulting in an RBC ratio of 528%, based on company action level capital of $131.8 million.\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to prior periods, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Life Insurance segment was a $3.6 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.4 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income. Excluding the impact of the voluntary early retirement program in 2018, other underwriting expenses increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to expenses associated with system enhancements and various other general expense increases associated with the growth of our business.\nFixed maturity other-than-temporary credit losses for 2019 included an asset-backed bond due to a decline in expected cash flows.\nWe operate predominantly in the life insurance industry through our principal subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life. Farm Bureau Life markets individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts to Farm Bureau members and other individuals and businesses in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States through an exclusive agency force. Other subsidiaries provide external wealth management services as well as investment management and other support services to our affiliated insurance companies. In addition, we manage two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies.\nOther underwriting expenses decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to various expense management actions including deferral of projects, reduction in the use of consultants and limiting replacement of employees that left the company. In addition, travel expenses were lower due to COVID-related travel restrictions. In 2018, we offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain employees. The impact of the program to the Annuity segment was a $1.9 million increase in other underwriting expenses and a $0.6 million increase in investment expenses, which lowered net investment income.\n\nFinancial results\n\u2022First, we discuss our business and drivers of profitability.\nWe analyze operations by reviewing financial information regarding our primary products that are aggregated in Annuity and Life Insurance product segments. In addition, our Corporate and Other segment includes our wealth management business, various support operations, corporate capital and other product lines that are not currently underwritten by the Company. We analyze our segment results based on pre-tax adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of certain items that are included in pre-tax net income. Pre-tax adjusted operating income is the same basis used for segment reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We also analyze operations using adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis, which excludes the initial impact from tax law changes. Adjusted operating income on a post-tax basis is not a measure used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of performance. We have included a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure herein. See Note 13 to our consolidated\nIn this discussion and analysis, we explain our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and where appropriate, factors that management believes may affect future performance, including:\nThe residential mortgage-backed portfolio includes government agency pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities. With a government agency pass through security, we receive a pro-rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans. CMOs consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches\u201d with varying stated maturities that provide sequential retirement of the bonds. While each tranche receives monthly interest payments, a subsequent tranche is not entitled to receive payment of principal until the entire principal of the preceding tranche is paid off. We primarily invest in sequential tranches, which allow us to manage cash flow stability and prepayment risk by the level of tranche in which we invest. In addition, to provide call protection and more stable average lives, we invest in CMOs such as planned amortization class (PAC) and targeted amortization class (TAC) securities. PAC bonds provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds and provide some protection against prepayment risk. TAC bonds provide protection from a rise in the prepayment rate due to falling interest rates. We generally do not purchase certain types of CMOs that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to excessive prepayment risk.\nRecent Accounting Changes\nThe following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nFootnotes applicable to the segment discussion that follows are as follows:\nOur exposure to interest rate risk stems from both the longevity of our life block and the interest rate sensitivity of our annuity products. We actively manage the projected cash flows, duration and key rate duration of these assets and liabilities by minimizing the difference between them. While it can be difficult to maintain asset and liability durations that are perfectly matched in a dynamic environment, we have identified various strategies that can be implemented if effective duration or key rate duration mismatches exceed acceptable tolerances.\nOur liquidity position remains strong with cash being generated by operations and financing activities. In addition, a significant portion of our liquid fixed maturity securities are in an unrealized gain position. See the Investments\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d discussions that follow.\n(9)Life insurance lapse and surrender rate represents the face amount of policyholder lapses and surrenders, incurred during the reporting period, as a percent of the simple average of related insurance in force at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The life insurance lapse and surrender rate is a measure of customer retention.\nThe other asset-backed securities are backed by both residential and non-residential collateral. The collateral for residential asset-backed securities primarily consists of second lien fixed-rate home equity loans. The cash flows of these securities are less subject to prepayment risk than residential mortgage-backed securities as the borrowers are less likely to refinance than those with only a first lien mortgage. The collateral for non-residential asset-backed securities primarily includes securities backed by credit card receivables, auto dealer receivables, auto installment loans, aircraft leases, middle market and syndicated business loans, timeshare receivables and trade and account receivables. The majority of these securities are high-quality, short-duration assets with limited cash flow variability.\n\u2022our revenues and expenses in the periods presented,\n\n\n\u2022The amount of spread (excess of net investment income earned over interest credited) we earn on contract holders' general account balances.\nDeath benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, vary from year-to-year due to changes in claim counts and average claim size. In 2020, death benefits in the Corporate and Other segment include COVID-19 related claims, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaling $2.4 million.\nMerger Agreement\nOur CLO portfolio included in other asset-backed securities is high quality, with all of the securities rated NAIC-1. Internal\n\u2022We conducted tactical sales of investments to reduce exposure to certain industries impacted by the economic downturn.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of market performance on our variable business. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to favorable market performance on our variable\n\u2022impact of these items on our overall financial condition and\nFor a portion of our business in force, we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in response to changes in portfolio yield. However, the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors and contractual guarantees. Surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial services institutions. In addition, if market rates were to stay at a low level for an extended period of time, our spread earnings could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products. See Part 1, Item 1 - Business, Business Segments for the ranges of guaranteed rates and where our products fall within those ranges.\nNet income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to changes in net realized gains/losses from investments and changes in fair value of derivatives. Net income and adjusted operating income increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs from the impact of market performance on our variable business and increased earnings from an increase in the volume of business in force. These increases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by increases in death benefits and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, Merger Agreement,\u201d on January 11, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into the Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by our board of directors, FBPCIC will acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares that are not currently owned or controlled by FBPCIC or IFBF, for $56.00 per Common Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain specified closing conditions, including approval by the Company's shareholders as described in Part I, Item 1, expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, clearance by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The obtaining of financing is not a condition to the obligations of FBPCIC or Merger Sub to effect the Merger.\nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Annuity segment increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and a decrease in other underwriting expenses, partially offset by lower spread income earned. Pre-tax adjusted operating income decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower spread income earned and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions.\n(2)Amount represents the transaction expenses relating to FBL Financial Group's proposed merger transaction.\n\u2022Our ability to manage the level of our operating expenses.\n(6)Annualized yield is the actual investment earnings during the year divided by average invested assets. Annualized yield is used as a measure of investment performance during the reporting periods.\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional analysis of these unrealized losses.\n\n(1)Amount represents a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the initial impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\n\nWe design our products to encourage persistency and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to help ensure targeted spreads are earned. In addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our products, certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions. Products such as supplementary contracts with life contingencies are not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal. Depending on the product, surrender charge rates on annuity contracts range up to 10.0% and surrender charge periods range up to 10 years and typically decrease 1.0% to 2.0% for every year the contract is in force.\n\nIf interest rates had increased 10% from levels at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments would have decreased approximately $75.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $123.2 million at December 31, 2019. These hypothetical changes in value do not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value for a portion of the underlying contracts.\n\u2022We earn mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts at annual rates ranging from 0% to 1.45% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. As a result, revenues from these sources fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the equity, fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, stockholders' equity was impacted by capital deployment actions during 2020. We paid a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share on our common stock and increased our regular quarterly common stock dividend by 4.2% to $0.50 per share.\n\u2022Collected annuity premium decreased to $182.3 million during 2020, compared to $252.0 million collected during 2019. These decreases were attributable to COVID-19 through fewer sales opportunities, decreased interest crediting rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nResults for 2018 were unfavorably impacted by the correction of an immaterial error related to a closed block of interest sensitive whole life business. The immaterial error arose and accumulated over several years, with none of those previous years being materially impacted. Remediation required an adjustment to existing in force business account values as well as adjustment to benefit payments for terminated business. The correction resulted in a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million, consisting of $3.5 million related to delayed benefit payments and $2.0 million of accrued interest. The change in estimate and accrued interest resulted in an increase to 2018 interest sensitive product benefits interest credited of $2.0 million, interest sensitive death benefits of $3.3 million and traditional life future policy benefits of $0.2 million.\nState and Political Subdivision Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products, such as ordinary annuities and universal life insurance, are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues. Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses. Our insurance subsidiaries receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited. For index products, proceeds from call options are earned from a portion of the funds deposited, which are passed through to the contract holders in the form of index credits. Index credits and interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022We also have equity price risk related to index product reserves related to guarantee living withdrawal benefits.\n\nState and political subdivision securities totaled $1,416.0 million, or 17.1% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020, and $1,477.2 million, or 19.2% of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2019, and include investments in general obligation, revenue and municipal housing bonds. Our investment strategy is to utilize municipal bonds in addition to corporate bonds, as we believe they provide additional diversification and have historically low default rates compared with similarly rated corporate bonds. We evaluate the credit strength of the underlying issues on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, excluding insurance, prior to acquisition. The majority of the municipal bonds we hold are investment grade credits without consideration of insurance. Our municipal bonds are well diversified by type and geography with the top exposure being water and sewer revenue bonds. Our municipal bond holdings were trading at 115.3% of amortized cost at December 31, 2020. We do not hold any Puerto Rico-related bonds. Exposure to the state of Illinois and municipalities within the state accounted for 1.1% of our total fixed maturities at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our Illinois-related portfolio holdings were rated investment grade and were valued at 119.4% of amortized cost.\n\u2022Our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns while providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and minimizing the risk of defaults or impairments of invested assets.\nCredit Risk\n\nDeath benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, vary from year-to-year due to changes in claim counts and average claim size. In 2020, death benefits in the Life Insurance segment include COVID-19 related claims, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaling $8.8 million.\n\u2022Actual experience and changes in assumptions for expected surrender and withdrawal rates, mortality and spreads used in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nNet income in 2020, compared to 2019, was negatively impacted by changes in net realized gains/losses from investments, the change in fair value of derivatives and expenses incurred during 2020 related to the proposed Merger. Net income and adjusted operating income decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to an increase in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, primarily due to COVID-19, the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and less spread income earned from lower yields on invested assets. These decreases in net income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by an increase in equity income and a reduction in other underwriting expenses and a benefit from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nThe models used to estimate the impact of a 10% change in market interest rates utilize many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations. Key assumptions in the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset-backed securities. The above estimates do not attempt to measure the financial statement impact on the resulting change in deferred acquisition costs, unearned revenue reserves, policyholder liabilities and income taxes. Due to the subjectivity of these assumptions, the actual impact of a 10% change in rates on the fair values would likely be different from that estimated.\n\u2022Our profitability would be impacted if there were little or no gains in the entire series of options purchased over the expected life of an indexed product, as we would incur expenses for credited interest over and above our option costs.\n\u2022Our ability to price our life insurance products to earn acceptable margins over the cost of providing benefits and the expenses of acquiring and administering the products. Competitive conditions, mortality experience, persistency, benefit utilization, investment results and our ability to maintain expenses in accordance with pricing assumptions drive our margins on the life products. On many products, we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a summary of fixed maturities by contractual maturity date.\n\u2022The amount by which bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage- and asset-backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates or decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates.\n\u2022The volume of our life insurance and annuity business in force, which is driven by the level of our sales and the persistency of the business written.\n(1)Equivalent ratings are based on those provided by nationally recognized rating agencies with some exceptions for certain residential mortgage, commercial mortgage- and asset-backed securities that are based on the expected loss of the security rather than the probability of default. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the equivalent credit rating.\n\nA major component of our asset-liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the expected cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities. We use models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios. Information from these models is used in the determination of investment strategies. Effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It measures the approximate percentage change in the fair value of a portfolio when interest rates change by 100 basis points at all points on the curve. Key rate duration is a bifurcation of the effective duration that measures the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates within two points on a curve. These measures include the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments. When the estimated effective durations of assets and liabilities are similar, exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities.\nFarm Bureau Life's cash inflows primarily consist of premiums, deposits to policyholder account balances, income from investments, sales, maturities and calls of investments; and repayments of investment principal. Farm Bureau Life's cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyholder account balances, investment purchases and payment of policy acquisition costs, policyholder benefits, income taxes, current operating expenses and dividends. Life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow that may be measured by the degree to which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred. The remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business. Continuing operations and financing activities from Farm Bureau Life relating to interest sensitive products provided funds totaling $286.1 million in 2020, $235.5 million in 2019 and $268.9 million in 2018.\nEquity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses attributable to our ownership interest in partnerships, joint ventures and certain companies over which we exhibit some control but have a minority ownership interest. We consistently use the most recent financial information available to account for equity income. Several of these entities are investment companies whose operating results are derived primarily from unrealized and realized gains and losses generated by their investment portfolios.\nThe level of realized gains (losses) is subject to fluctuation from period to period due to the timing of investment sales and credit losses, changes in the carrying value of investments held at fair value as well as changes in allowances for credit losses. See Financial Condition - Investments\u201d and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for details regarding our unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note decreased to 0.93% at December 31, 2020 from 1.92% at December 31, 2019.\nFor variable universal life and variable annuities, premiums received are not reported as revenues. Similar to universal life and ordinary annuities, revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders. Expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances.\n(8)Includes prepayment fee income and adjustments to the amortization of premium or discounts from changes in our payment speed assumptions on mortgage and other asset-backed securities.\n(1)Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Since accumulated other comprehensive income fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of investments caused principally by changes in market interest rates, we believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information.\nManagement took several actions to address these challenges.\n\u2022expected sources and uses of cash.\nThe following are key measures which partially illustrate the impact from COVID-19 on the economy:\n\nStockholders' Equity\ninsurance products are competitive within the marketplace or for contractual reasons in the case of products earning guaranteed rates, will result in lower earnings.\n(2)Amount represents the transaction expenses relating to FBL Financial Group's proposed merger transaction.\nOur profitability is primarily a factor of:\nEquity Income\n(5)Annualized average crediting rates consist of annualized interest credited and index credits applied to policyholders during the reporting period, along with amortization of call option costs and proceeds from sales or maturing call options associated with the call options that back our indexed products as a percentage of the simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning of the reporting period and end of the reporting period, adjusted for interest credited during the period. Annualized average crediting rates along with annualized average investment yields provides a view of spread margin earned on the underlying products.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the U.S. economy during 2020. Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 the United States experienced significant economic disruption as businesses closed and consumer access to goods and services became limited due to regulated or voluntary quarantine measures. As a result, the financial markets reacted negatively, impacting corporate liquidity and market interest rates. After the initial shock, the U.S. economy improved with the aid of significant economic stimulus measures, resulting in the stabilization of financial markets.\nMortgage and Asset-Backed Securities\nWe have exposure to credit risk as it relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given entity to make timely payments of principal and interest. See Financial Condition - Investments\u201d for additional information about credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 96.1% (based on carrying value) of the available-for-sale fixed maturities were investment grade debt securities, defined as being in the highest two National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) designations. Non-investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers. In addition, the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for investment grade debt securities. We regularly review the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in non-investment grade debt securities (NAIC designations 3 through 6). As of December 31, 2020, no single non-investment grade holding exceeded 0.2% of total investments.\nOur business generally benefits from moderate to strong economic expansion. Conversely, a lackluster economy characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, muted corporate earnings growth and lower business investment could adversely impact the demand for our products in the future. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims, lapses or surrenders of policies during such times. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFinancial position\nThe mortgage- and asset-backed securities can be summarized into three broad categories: residential, commercial and other asset-backed securities.\n(6)Average aggregate individual annuity account value is a measure used to monitor business growth in our individual fixed and indexed annuity product lines and is calculated using a simple average of policyholder account values as of the beginning and end of the reporting period.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are primarily sequential securities. CMBS typically have cash flows that are less subject to refinance risk than residential mortgage-backed securities principally due to prepayment restrictions on many of the underlying commercial mortgage loans.\nOur profitability is also impacted by changes in accounting guidance that affect the timing of profit recognition. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for details on adopted and pending accounting pronouncements.\nInvestments\nThe repayment pattern on mortgage and other asset-backed securities is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities because the repayment terms are tied to underlying debt obligations that are subject to prepayments. The prepayment speeds (e.g., the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages) can vary based on a number of economic factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. These factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy.\nResults of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2020\nInterest Rate Risk\nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Corporate and Other segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in expenses and amortization of deferred acquisition costs driven by the impact of market performance on our variable business and a decrease in net investment income, partially offset by an increase in equity income. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Corporate and Other segment decreased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs driven by the impact of market performance on our variable business, partially offset by the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and increases in expenses and death benefits.\nFarm Bureau Life's ability to pay dividends to the parent company is limited by law to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus) as of the date the dividend is paid, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the State of Iowa. At December 31, 2020, Farm Bureau Life's statutory unassigned surplus was $494.6 million. There are certain additional limits on the amount of dividends that may be paid within a year without approval of the Insurance Division, Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the Iowa Insurance Division) as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. During 2021, the maximum amount legally available for distribution to the parent company without further regulatory approval is $87.4 million. Timing of such dividends during the year is limited based on the timing of dividends paid within the preceding 12 months.\nOur stockholders' equity increased at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to the change in unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities during the period and net income, partially offset by dividends paid.\nA prolonged period of low interest rates may result in increased downward pressure on average earned yields for the investment portfolios supporting our annuity and universal life business as higher-yielding fixed maturity securities and mortgages are sold, mature or are prepaid and replaced with lower-yielding investments. Lower investment income may cause us to lower crediting rates on our spread-based annuity and life insurance products, which in turn may reduce their attractiveness to potential customers. Failure to lower crediting rates as portfolio investment yields decline, either by choice, to ensure our spread-based\nIncome taxes on adjustments to net income have been recorded at 21% in 2019 and 2018 as there are no permanent differences between book and taxable income relating to these adjustments. In 2020, there is no income tax offset attributable to the proposed acquisition transaction expenses, as they are not deductible for income tax purposes. Also in 2020, the income tax offset attributable to realized gains (losses) includes an additional tax benefit of $0.3 million related to capital losses expected to be carried back to 2017 when the income tax rate was 35%. Income taxes on all other 2020 adjustments to net income have been recorded at 21%.\n\n\u2022changes in revenues and expenses between periods,\nAt each balance sheet date, we review and update our expectation of future prepayment speeds and the book value of the mortgage and other asset-backed securities purchased at a premium or discount is reset, if needed. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for more detail on accounting for the amortization of premium and accrual of discount on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.\nWe periodically revise key assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance in force acquired, deferred sales inducements, unearned revenue reserve for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products, as applicable, through an unlocking\u201d process. These assumptions typically consist of withdrawal and lapse rates, rider utilization, earned spreads and mortality with revisions based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience. The impact of unlocking is recorded in the current period as an increase or decrease to amortization of the respective balances. While the unlocking process can take place at any time, as needs dictate, the process typically takes place during the third quarter. See the discussion that follows for further details of the unlocking impact on our results in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe CDR is the constant default rate (annually) that a CLO must suffer before our tranche takes its first dollar loss.\nOverview and Profitability\n\n(7)Individual annuity withdrawal rate represents withdrawal benefits incurred during the reporting period, excluding internal exchanges, as a percent of the simple average of related policy reserves at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The individual annuity withdrawal rate is a measure customer retention.\n\u2022As the economic downturn and lack of consumer mobility put strain on certain issuers, net realized capital losses and the change in allowance for credit losses totaled $16.3 million during 2020 compared to net realized capital gains including other-than-temporary impairment losses of $7.6 million during 2019. The majority of these losses were incurred during the first quarter 2020.\nLiquidity\nWe also include within our analysis premiums collected,\u201d another measure that is not used in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but is a common life insurance industry measure of agent productivity. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding this measure and its relationship to GAAP revenues.\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding how we define our segments and pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nin force. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Life Insurance segment increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions and the impact from an increase in the volume of business in force.\nThe annualized yield on average invested assets for individual annuities decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to the prior periods, primarily due to lower yields on new investment acquisitions from premium receipts and reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing investments, compared with the average existing portfolio yield. The decrease in 2020, compared to 2019, was partially offset by higher other investment-related income while we recognized a decrease in other investment-related income in 2019 compared to 2018. See the Financial Condition\u201d section that follows for additional information regarding the yields obtained on investment acquisitions. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to crediting and cap rate actions taken in 2020 in response to a declining portfolio yield and a change in our mix of business in force, partially offset by increased amortization of call option costs supporting our index annuity products. Annualized average crediting rates on our individual annuity products increased in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased amortization of call option costs.\nParent company cash inflows from operations consist primarily of fees that it charges various subsidiaries and affiliates for management of their operations, expense reimbursements and tax settlements from subsidiaries and affiliates, investment income and dividends from subsidiaries, if declared and paid. Revenue sources for the parent company during 2020 included management fees from subsidiaries and affiliates totaling $7.9 million and dividends of $98.5 million. Cash outflows are principally for salaries, taxes and other expenses related to providing management services, dividends on outstanding stock, stock repurchases and interest on our parent company debt.\n\n Balance Sheet Caption Description of Critical Estimate Assumptions / Approach Used Effect if Different Assumptions / Approach Used Other assets/liabilities The determination of net periodic pension cost and related accrued/prepaid pension expense requires the use of estimates as to the expected return on plan assets, discount rate on plan liabilities and other accrual assumptions. Pension expense for 2020 totaled $4.1 million. To determine our net periodic pension costs for 2020, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.85% and a discount rate of 3.37%. Details regarding the method used to determine the discount rate are summarized in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The long-term rate of return may fluctuate over time based on asset mix and if investment returns over a long period of time significantly differ from historical returns. The discount rate changes annually as it is based on current yields for high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension obligations. As fluctuations in the expected long-term rate of return and discount rate have been historically moderate and we have no current plans to change our investment strategy significantly, we believe a change of up to 100 basis points is reasonably likely. A 100 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would result in a $1.2 million increase in pension expense and a 100 basis point increase would result in a $1.2 million decrease to pension expense. A 100 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would result in a $2.7 million increase in pension expense while a 100 basis point increase would result in a $2.4 million decrease to pension expense. The information above is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future changes in the long-term rate of return or discount rates. Deferred income taxes The amount of deferred tax assets we hold is dependent on our estimate of the future deductibility of certain items. A valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. No valuation allowance was recorded on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020. We utilize tax planning strategies, which require forward-looking assumptions and management judgment, to determine the deductibility of certain items and to assess the need for a valuation allowance. During periods in which we have deferred tax assets related to unrealized investment losses, we utilize tax planning strategies, including a buy-and-hold investment philosophy for securities experiencing unrealized losses and the sale of appreciated securities to ensure the deductibility of such losses in future periods. At December 31, 2020, we held gross deferred tax assets totaling $45.0 million, primarily related to future policy benefits, employee benefits and loss carryforwards. Utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on our future earnings. No valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets, as we believe future earnings will be sufficient to ensure their utilization. If future earnings are no longer expected to be sufficient, a valuation allowance will need to be established. Given the number of variables that impact the level of future earnings, it is not practicable to estimate a range of possible outcomes to the valuation of the deferred tax assets. Future changes in tax rates and other tax laws may also impact the utilization of deferred tax assets. \nPre-tax adjusted operating income for the Life Insurance segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, partially offset by reduced other underwriting expenses and a benefit from the impact of an increase in the volume of business\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting estimates and the hypothetical effects of changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate, are included in the following table. We have discussed the identification, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n(3)The items excluded from adjusted operating income impact the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserve. Certain interest sensitive reserves as well as income taxes are also impacted.\nCash Flows\n\n\n\u2022Changes in the fair value of our equity securities are reported in earnings.\n\u2022We have equity price risk to the extent we may owe amounts under the guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit provisions of our variable annuity contracts.
