Such factors include, among other things, the following:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Future operations and financial results of our tenants, and in turn ours, will likely be materially impacted by numerous factors and future developments related to COVID-19. Such factors and developments include, but are not limited to, the length of time and severity of the spread of the pandemic; the volume of cancelled or rescheduled elective procedures and the volume of COVID-19 patients treated by the operators of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities; measures our tenants are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of government and administrative regulation, including travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, quarantines, the promotion of social distancing, business shutdowns and limitations on business activity; changes in patient volumes at our tenants' hospitals and other healthcare facilities due to patients' general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system; the impact of stimulus on the health care industry and our tenants; changes in patient volumes and payer mix caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions (including increases in uninsured and underinsured patients as the result of business closings and layoffs); potential disruptions to clinical staffing and shortages and disruptions related to supplies required for our tenants' employees and patients, including equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment, or PPE; potential increases to expenses incurred by our tenants related to staffing, supply chain or other expenditures; the impact of our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms; disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact our ability to access capital or increase associated borrowing costs; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher sustained rates of unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer spending and confidence. There may be significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on our hospital properties leased to subsidiaries of UHS to the extent that each hospital continues to experience significant decline in patient volumes and revenues. These factors may result in the inability or unwillingness on the part of some of our tenants to make timely payment of their rent to us at current levels or to seek to amend or terminate their leases which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our occupancy levels and our revenue and cash flow and the value of our properties, and potentially, our ability to maintain our dividend at current levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Due to COVID-19 restrictions and its impact on the economy, we may experience a decrease in prospective tenants which could unfavorably impact the volume of new leases, as well as the renewal rate of existing leases. The COVID-19 pandemic may delay our construction projects which could result in increased costs and delay the timing of opening and rental payments from those projects, although no such delays have yet occurred. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, as well as risks associated with disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact us from a financing perspective; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, COVID-19 vaccinations have begun to be administered and while we expect that administration of vaccines will assist in easing the number of COVID-19 cases, the pace at which this is likely to occur is difficult to predict. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results during 2020, we believe that developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially have a material adverse impact on our future financial results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Recent legislation, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act ( PPPHCE Act\u201d), has provided grant funding to hospitals and other healthcare providers to assist them during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and the federal government may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional stimulus measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance our tenants will receive under the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our tenants' operations or how they will affect operations of our tenants' competitors.

President Biden is expected to undertake executive actions that will strengthen the Legislation and may reverse the policies of the prior administration. The Trump Administration had directed the issuance of final rules (i) enabling the formation of association health plans that would be exempt from certain Legislation requirements such as the provision of essential health benefits; (ii) expanding the availability of short-term, limited duration health insurance, (iii) eliminating cost-sharing reduction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> payments to insurers that would otherwise offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for health plan enrollees at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level; (iv) relaxing requirements for state innovation waivers that could reduce enrollment in the individual and small group markets and lead to additional enrollment in short-term, limited duration insurance and association health plans; (v) incentivizing the use of health reimbursement arrangements by employers to permit employees to purchase health insurance in the individual market, and; (vi) directing the issuance of federal rulemaking by executive agencies to increase transparency of healthcare price and quality information. The uncertainty resulting from these Executive Branch policies has led to reduced Exchange enrollment in 2018 and 2019 and is expected to further worsen the individual and small group market risk pools in future years. It is also anticipated that these policies, to the extent that they remain as implemented, may create additional cost and reimbursement pressures on hospitals, including ours. In addition, while attempts to repeal the entirety of the Legislation have not been successful to date, a key provision of the Legislation was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and on December 14, 2018, a federal U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled the entire Legislation is unconstitutional. That ruling was stayed and has been appealed. On December 18, 2019, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to strike down the Legislation individual mandate as unconstitutional and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court in Texas to determine which Legislation provisions should be stricken with the mandate. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear, during the 2020-2021 term, two consolidated cases, filed by the State of California and the United States House of Representatives, asking the Supreme Court to review the ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was heard on November 10, 2020, and a ruling is expected in 2021. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice announced that it has withdrawn support for the challenge before the Supreme Court. We are unable to predict the final outcome of this matter which has caused greater uncertainty regarding the future status of the Legislation.

All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate: Purchase accounting is applied to the assets and liabilities related to all real estate investments acquired from third parties. In accordance with current accounting guidance, we account for our property acquisitions as acquisitions of assets, which requires the capitalization of acquisition costs to the underlying assets and prohibits the recognition of goodwill or bargain purchase gains. The fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, and acquired ground leases, based in each case on their fair values. Loan premiums, in the case of above market rate assumed loans, or loan discounts, in the case of below market assumed loans, are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate.\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are determined based on comparable land sales for land and replacement costs adjusted for physical and market obsolescence for the improvements. The fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are also determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property based on assumptions that a market participant would use, which is similar to methods used by independent appraisers. In addition, there is intangible value related to having tenants leasing space in the purchased property, which is referred to as in-place lease value. Such value results primarily from the buyer of a leased property avoiding the costs associated with leasing the property and also avoiding rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the hypothetical lease-up period. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases.\nIn allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) estimated fair market lease rates from the perspective of a market participant for the corresponding in-place leases, measured, for above-market leases, over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease and, for below-market leases, over a period equal to the initial term plus any below market fixed rate renewal periods. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values, also referred to as acquired lease obligations, are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial terms of the respective leases.\nAsset Impairment: We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value or third party appraisals.\nIn considering whether to classify a property as held for sale, we consider factors such as whether management has committed to a plan to sell the property, the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition for a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value, the sale of the property is probable, and actions required for management to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will made to the plan. If all the criteria are met, we classify the property as held for sale. Upon being classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization related to the property ceases and it is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assets and related liabilities of the property are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Only those assets held for sale that constitute a strategic shift or that will have a major effect on our operations are classified as discontinued operations.\nAn other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated LLC is recognized when the carrying value of the investment is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value, including projected declines in cash flow. To the extent impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income.\nFederal Income Taxes: No provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to shareholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal, state or local income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis. The excise tax equals 4% of the amount by which 85% of our ordinary income plus 95% of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year, as defined. No provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due.\nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders, will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $19.4 million as compared to $19.0 million during 2019. The $483,000 increase was primarily attributable to:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $2.04 million decrease resulting from lease expirations on two hospital facilities located in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Evansville, Indiana, that occurred on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively (each facility has remained vacant since the respective date of lease expiration);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $2.27 million increase resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $1.95 million decrease resulting from gains recorded during 2019 related to the sale of the Kings Crossing II MOB and the sale of a parcel of land;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $565,000 increase in bonus rentals earned on the three hospital facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $289,000 increase resulting from a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $1.35 million of other combined net increases, including increased net income experienced at various properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues increased $847,000, or 1.1%, during 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was due to: (i) an aggregate net increase of $1.71 million experienced at various properties; (ii) a $565,000 increase in the bonus rentals; (iii) a $311,000 increase resulting from an MOB that was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by; (iv) a $1.74 million decrease resulting from the revenues recorded during 2019 in connection with two hospital facilities that had lease expirations and vacancies in June and September of 2019 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting).\nIncluded in our other operating expenses are expenses related to the consolidated medical office buildings and two vacant hospital facilities (as discussed herein), which totaled $19.8 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating expenses for 2020 and 2019 include expenses associated with the lease expirations at two of our hospital facilities, which are currently vacant, of approximately $677,000 and $370,000 in the aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A large portion of the expenses associated with our consolidated medical office buildings is passed on directly to the tenants either directly as tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses of included in base rental amounts. Tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred and are included as tenant reimbursement revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely recognized measure of performance for Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs\u201d). We believe that FFO and FFO per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. We compute FFO, as reflected on the attached Supplemental Schedules, in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we interpret the definition. FFO adjusts for the effects of gains, such as gains on transactions during the periods presented. To the extent a REIT recognizes a gain or loss with respect to the sale of incidental assets, such as the sale of land peripheral to operating properties, the REIT has the option to exclude or include such gains and losses in the calculation of FFO. We have opted to exclude gains and losses from sales of incidental assets in our calculation of FFO. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO should not be used as: (i) an indication of our financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP; (iii) a measure of our liquidity, or; (iv) an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our reported net income to FFO for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense on consolidated investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense on unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sales of real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,951\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds From Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average number of shares outstanding - Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds From Operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur FFO increased $2.2 million, or $.16 per diluted share, during 2020 as compared to 2019 due to: (i) a favorable impact of $2.3 million, or $.17 per diluted share, resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings; (ii) a favorable impact of $565,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in bonus rentals; (iii) other combined net increases of $1.4 million, or $.10 per diluted share, partially offset by; (iv) an unfavorable impact of $2.0 million, or $.15 per diluted share, related to the above-mentioned vacancies at two of our hospitals as a result of lease expirations on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 (excluding the related interest expense impact).\nDuring 2020, we had a total of 39 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings as indicated in Item 2. Properties, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 30% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (21% related to renewed leases and 9% related to new leases). During 2019, we had a total of 62 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 24% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (17% related to renewed leases and 7% related to new leases).\nRental rates, tenant improvement costs and rental concessions vary from property to property based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the current occupancy and age of our buildings, local overall economic conditions, proximity to hospital campuses and the vacancy rates, rental rates and capacity of our competitors in the market. In connection with lease renewals executed during each year, the weighted-average rental rates, as compared to rental rates on the expired leases, decreased by approximately 1% during 2020 and remained relatively unchanged during 2019. The weighted-average tenant improvement costs associated with new or renewed leases was approximately $18 and $15 per square foot during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average leasing commissions on the new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 3% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2020 and 2% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2019. The average aggregate value of the tenant concessions, generally consisting of rent abatements, provided in connection with new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 0.9% and 0.4% of the future aggregate base rental revenue over the lease terms during 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Until various times during the second quarter of 2018, these properties were temporarily closed and non-operational as we continued to reconstruct and restore them to operational condition. As of June 30, 2018, reconstruction on all of the occupied space in these properties had been completed and operations had resumed.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, pursuant to the terms of a global settlement with our commercial property insurance carrier, we received $5.5 million of additional insurance recovery proceeds bringing the aggregate hurricane-related insurance recoveries to $12.5 million. The aggregate insurance recovery proceeds, which are net of applicable deductibles, covered substantially all of the costs incurred related to the remediation, repair and reconstruction of each of these properties as well business interruption recoveries for the lost income related to each of these properties during the period they were non-operational.\nIncluded in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are hurricane insurance recoveries of approximately $4.5 million consisting of recovery proceeds in excess of the damaged property write-downs. Additionally, during 2018, we recorded approximately $1.2 million of hurricane business interruption insurance recoveries in connection with the damage sustained from Hurricane Harvey. Included in this amount, which covered the period of late August, 2017 through the second quarter of 2018 (after satisfaction of the applicable deductibles), was approximately $500,000 related to the period of August, 2017 through December, 2017.\nOther Operating Results\nInterest Expense:\nReflected below are the components of our interest expense which amounted to $8.3 million during 2020, $10.5 million during 2019 and $10.0 million during 2018 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate caps income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (a.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (288\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (a.)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate swaps expense/(income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (b.)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (c.)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of fair value of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized interest on major projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (a.)\n</td> <td> Represents interest paid to us by the counterparties pursuant to two interest rate caps with a combined notional amount of $60 million, which expired in March 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (b.)\n</td> <td> Represents net interest paid by us to the counterparties pursuant to three interest rates SWAPs with a combined notional amount of $140 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (c.)\n</td> <td> Represents net interest paid to us by the counterparties pursuant to an interest rates SWAPs with a notional amount of $50 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased $2.27 million during 2020 to $8.26 million as compared to $10.53 million during 2019.

The increase was primarily due to: (i) a $717,000 increase in interest expense on our revolving credit agreement resulting from an increase in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement (3.5% during 2019 as compared to 3.3% during 2018), as well as an increase in our average outstanding borrowings ($198.3 million during 2019 as compared to $191.4 million during 2018); (ii) a $58,000 net increase in interest expense related to interest rate swaps/caps; (iii) a $120,000 decrease in mortgage interest expense, resulting primarily from the repayment of a mortgage loans during 2018 and 2019, and; (iv) $99,000 of other combined net decreases in interest expense.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly impact the United States in mid-March, 2020. As a result of various policies implemented by the federal and state governments, and varying by individual state, many non-essential businesses in the nation were closed for varying time periods. We believe that by June 30, 2020, substantially all of our tenants had resumed operations of their businesses.\nTenants representing approximately 99% of our occupied square footage have paid their rents through December 31, 2020. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through December 31, 2020, we believe that the potentially adverse impact that the pandemic may have on our future operations and financial results of our tenants, and in turn ours, will depend upon many factors, most of which are beyond our, or our tenants', ability to control or predict. Since the underlying businesses in each of our properties are operated by the tenants, we can provide no assurance that the businesses will continue to operate in the future, or stay current with their lease obligations.\nSince the bonus rents earned by us on the three acute care hospitals leased to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Universal Health Services, Inc., are computed based upon a computation that compares each hospital's current quarter revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year, we could experience significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on these properties should those hospitals experience significant declines in patient volumes and revenues. These hospitals believe that, to the extent that they experience revenue declines and increased expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as ultimately measured over the life of the pandemic, they are eligible for emergency fund grants as provided for by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n( CARES Act\u201d). Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 include bonus rental attributable to revenues recorded by these three hospitals in connection with CARES Act grants.\nThroughout the common areas of many properties in our portfolio, we have implemented COVID-19 risk mitigating actions such as, enhanced cleaning protocols including supplemental cleaning and sanitizing of high-touch points, limiting points of entry at certain facilities, and coordinating with health care providers to assess or screen patients prior to entering certain of our MOBs.\nDisclosures Related to Certain Hospital Facilities\nPlease refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting, for additional information regarding certain of our hospital facilities including Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus; Evansville, Indiana; Corpus Christi, Texas, and; Kindred Hospital Chicago Central.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we and the operators of our hospital facilities cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our/their ability to contain future expense increases. Depending on general economic and labor market conditions, the operators of our hospital facilities may experience unfavorable labor market conditions, including a shortage of nurses which may cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. Their ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit their ability to increase prices. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us.\nMost of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Our hospital leases require all building operating expenses, including maintenance, real estate taxes and other costs, to be paid by the lessee. In addition, certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions, which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount. In addition, most of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes. These provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation. To the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions, our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $44.2 million during 2020 as compared to $42.7 million during 2019.

As also indicated on our statements of cash flows, non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization expense, amortization related to above/below market leases, amortization of debt premium, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs (as applicable) and gains on sales of real estate assets (as applicable), are the primary differences between our net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each year.\nWe declared and paid dividends of $38.0 million during 2020, $37.4 million during 2019 and $36.8 million during 2018. During 2020, the $44.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.2 million greater than the $38.0 million of dividends paid during 2020. During 2019, the $42.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.2 million greater than the $37.4 million of dividends paid during 2019. During 2018, the $42.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.1 million greater than the $36.8 million of dividends paid during 2018.\nAs indicated in the cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities sections of the statements of cash flows, there were various other sources and uses of cash during each of the last three years. From time to time, various other sources and uses of cash may include items such as investments and advances made to/from LLCs, additions to real estate investments, acquisitions/divestiture of properties, net borrowings/repayments of debt, and proceeds generated from the issuance of equity. Therefore, in any given period, the funding source for our dividend payments is not wholly dependent on the operating cash flow generated by our properties. Rather, our dividends as well as our capital reinvestments into our existing properties, acquisitions of real property and other investments are funded based upon the aggregate net cash inflows or outflows from all sources and uses of cash from the properties we own either in whole or through LLCs, as outlined above.\nIn determining and monitoring our dividend level on a quarterly basis, our management and Board of Trustees consider many factors in determining the amount of dividends to be paid each period. These considerations primarily include: (i) the minimum required amount of dividends to be paid in order to maintain our REIT status; (ii) the current and projected operating results of our properties, including those owned in LLCs, and; (iii) our future capital commitments and debt repayments, including those of our LLCs. Based upon the information discussed above, as well as consideration of projections and forecasts of our future operating cash flows, management and the Board of Trustees have determined that our operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund our dividend payments. Future dividend levels will be determined based upon the factors outlined above with consideration given to our projected future results of operations.\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing $350 million revolving credit agreement (which had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit as of December 31, 2020); (ii) borrowings under or refinancing of existing third-party debt pursuant to mortgage loan agreements entered into by our consolidated and unconsolidated LLCs/LPs; (iii) the issuance of equity pursuant to our at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) equity issuance program, and/or; (iv) the issuance of other long-term debt.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months, including providing sufficient capital to allow us to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nCredit facilities and mortgage debt\nManagement routinely monitors and analyzes the Trust's capital structure in an effort to maintain the targeted balance among capital resources including the level of borrowings pursuant to our $350 million revolving credit facility, the level of borrowings pursuant to non-recourse mortgage debt secured by the real property of our properties and our level of equity including consideration of additional equity issuances pursuant to our ATM equity issuance program. This ongoing analysis considers factors such as the current debt market and interest rate environment, the current/projected occupancy and financial performance of our properties, the current loan-to-value ratio of our properties, the Trust's current stock price, the capital resources required for anticipated acquisitions and the expected capital to be generated by anticipated divestitures. This analysis, together with consideration of the Trust's current balance of revolving credit agreement borrowings, non-recourse mortgage borrowings and equity, assists management in deciding which capital resource to utilize when events such as refinancing of specific debt components occur or additional funds are required to finance the Trust's growth.\nIn June 2020, we entered into the first amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to the revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, an additional tranche of revolving credit commitments in the amount of $50 million, designated as the Revolving B Facility\u201d, was established thereby increasing the aggregate revolving credit commitment to $350 million from $300 million. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in March 2022, provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million, including a $40 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $30 million sublimit for swingline/short-term loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Trust. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in and liens on all equity interests in certain of the Trust's wholly-owned subsidiaries. The remainder of the revolving credit commitments provided under the Credit Agreement that were in effect prior to giving effect to the First Amendment, has been designated as the Revolving A Facility\u201d.\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Revolving A Facility will bear interest, at our option, at one, two, three or six-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.35% or at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.35%. The Credit Agreement defines Base Rate\u201d as the greater of: (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%. A facility fee of 0.15% to 0.35% will be charged on the total commitment of the Revolving A Facility of the Credit Agreement. The margins over LIBOR, Base Rate and the facility fee are based upon our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 1.20%, the margin over the Base Rate was 0.20%, and the facility fee was 0.20%. The Credit Agreement also provides for options to extend the maturity date and borrowing availability for two additional six-month periods for the Revolving A Facility.\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Revolving B Facility will bear interest, at our option, at one, two, three or six months LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.85% to 2.10% or at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.10%. The Credit Agreement defines Base Rate\u201d as the greatest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%. The initial applicable margin is 1.95% for LIBOR loans and 0.95% for Base Rate loans. A facility fee of 0.15% to 0.35% will be charged on the total commitment of the Revolving B Facility of the Credit Agreement. The margins over LIBOR, Base Rate and the facility fee are based upon our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 1.95%, the margin over the Base Rate was 0.95% and the facility fee was 0.20%.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $236.2 million of outstanding borrowings and $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement. We had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The carrying amount and fair value of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement was $236.2 million at December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements. The average amount outstanding under our Credit Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $219.1 million, $198.3 million and $191.4 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 2.4%, 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, including commitment fees and interest rate swaps/caps. At December 31, 2019, we had $213.0 million of outstanding borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit agreement and $87.0 million of available borrowing capacity.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on certain indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and other investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions and dividends and other distributions. The Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants regarding the Trust's ratio of total debt to total assets, the fixed charge coverage ratio, the ratio of total secured debt to total asset value, the ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value, and minimum tangible net worth, as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which may trigger an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all of the covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We also believe that we would remain in compliance if, assuming that the majority of the potential new borrowings will be used to fund investments, the full amount of our commitment was borrowed.\nThe following table includes a summary of the required compliance ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019, giving effect to the covenants contained in the Credit Agreements in effect on the respective dates

Such factors and developments include, but are not limited to, the length of time and severity of the spread of the pandemic; the volume of cancelled or rescheduled elective procedures and the volume of COVID-19 patients treated by the operators of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities; measures our tenants are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of government and administrative regulation, including travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, quarantines, the promotion of social distancing, business shutdowns and limitations on business activity; changes in patient volumes at our tenants' hospitals and other healthcare facilities due to patients' general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system; the impact of stimulus on the health care industry and our tenants; changes in patient volumes and payer mix caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions (including increases in uninsured and underinsured patients as the result of business closings and layoffs); potential disruptions to clinical staffing and shortages and disruptions related to supplies required for our tenants' employees and patients, including equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment, or PPE; potential increases to expenses incurred by our tenants related to staffing, supply chain or other expenditures; the impact of our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms; disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact our ability to access capital or increase associated borrowing costs; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher sustained rates of unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer spending and confidence. There may be significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on our hospital properties leased to subsidiaries of UHS to the extent that each hospital continues to experience significant decline in patient volumes and revenues. These factors may result in the inability or unwillingness on the part of some of our tenants to make timely payment of their rent to us at current levels or to seek to amend or terminate their leases which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our occupancy levels and our revenue and cash flow and the value of our properties, and potentially, our ability to maintain our dividend at current levels. \nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense on consolidated investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense on unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,535\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sales of real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,951\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds From Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average number of shares outstanding - Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds From Operations per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDisclosures Related to Certain Hospital Facilities\n \u2022 The individual and collective impact of the changes made by the CARES Act on REITs and their security holders are uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time;

Changes in market rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of debt, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow. Excludes $39.7 million of combined third-party debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, that is non-recourse to us, at the unconsolidated LLCs in which we hold various non-controlling ownership interests (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). \nIn late August 2017, five of our medical office buildings located in the Houston, Texas area, incurred extensive water damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Until various times during the second quarter of 2018, these properties were temporarily closed and non-operational as we continued to reconstruct and restore them to operational condition. As of June 30, 2018, reconstruction on all of the occupied space in these properties had been completed and operations had resumed.\n \u2022 The potential unfavorable impact on our business of the deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a further worsening of credit and/or capital market conditions, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain capital which may be required to fund the future growth of our business and refinance existing debt with near term maturities. \n \u2022 received $23.3 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \nAs indicated on the following table, we have various mortgages, all of which are non-recourse to us and are not cross-collateralized, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nNet cash used in investing activities was $27.2 million during 2020 as compared to $16.5 million during 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on certain indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and other investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions and dividends and other distributions. The Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants regarding the Trust's ratio of total debt to total assets, the fixed charge coverage ratio, the ratio of total secured debt to total asset value, the ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value, and minimum tangible net worth, as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which may trigger an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all of the covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We also believe that we would remain in compliance if, assuming that the majority of the potential new borrowings will be used to fund investments, the full amount of our commitment was borrowed.\n \u2022 The operators of our facilities face competition from other health care providers, including physician owned facilities and other competing facilities, including certain facilities operated by UHS but the real property of which is not owned by us. Such competition is experienced in markets including, but not limited to, McAllen, Texas, the site of our McAllen Medical Center, a 370-bed acute care hospital, and Riverside County, California, the site of our Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus, a 130-bed acute care hospital. \nManagement routinely monitors and analyzes the Trust's capital structure in an effort to maintain the targeted balance among capital resources including the level of borrowings pursuant to our $350 million revolving credit facility, the level of borrowings pursuant to non-recourse mortgage debt secured by the real property of our properties and our level of equity including consideration of additional equity issuances pursuant to our ATM equity issuance program. This ongoing analysis considers factors such as the current debt market and interest rate environment, the current/projected occupancy and financial performance of our properties, the current loan-to-value ratio of our properties, the Trust's current stock price, the capital resources required for anticipated acquisitions and the expected capital to be generated by anticipated divestitures. This analysis, together with consideration of the Trust's current balance of revolving credit agreement borrowings, non-recourse mortgage borrowings and equity, assists management in deciding which capital resource to utilize when events such as refinancing of specific debt components occur or additional funds are required to finance the Trust's growth.\n (e) Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020, as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements -Lease Accounting, in connection with ground leases at fourteen of our consolidated properties. \nIn allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) estimated fair market lease rates from the perspective of a market participant for the corresponding in-place leases, measured, for above-market leases, over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease and, for below-market leases, over a period equal to the initial term plus any below market fixed rate renewal periods. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values, also referred to as acquired lease obligations, are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial terms of the respective leases.\nAs indicated on our consolidated statements of cash flows, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of $44.2 million during 2020, $42.7 million during 2019 and $42.9 million during 2018. As also indicated on our statements of cash flows, non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization expense, amortization related to above/below market leases, amortization of debt premium, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs (as applicable) and gains on sales of real estate assets (as applicable), are the primary differences between our net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each year.\nDuring 2020, $27.2 million of net cash was used in investing activities as follows:\nThroughout the common areas of many properties in our portfolio, we have implemented COVID-19 risk mitigating actions such as, enhanced cleaning protocols including supplemental cleaning and sanitizing of high-touch points, limiting points of entry at certain facilities, and coordinating with health care providers to assess or screen patients prior to entering certain of our MOBs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $17.4 million during 2020, as compared to $25.1 million during 2019.\nAdditional cash flow and dividends paid information for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n (c.) Represents net interest paid to us by the counterparties pursuant to an interest rates SWAPs with a notional amount of $50 million. \n \u2022 received $318,000 of cash distributions in excess of income received from our unconsolidated LLCs ($2.1 million of cash distributions received less $1.8 million of equity in income of unconsolidated LLCs), and; \nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:\nRental rates, tenant improvement costs and rental concessions vary from property to property based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the current occupancy and age of our buildings, local overall economic conditions, proximity to hospital campuses and the vacancy rates, rental rates and capacity of our competitors in the market. In connection with lease renewals executed during each year, the weighted-average rental rates, as compared to rental rates on the expired leases, remained relatively unchanged during 2019 and decreased 3% during 2018. The weighted-average tenant improvement costs associated with new or renewed leases was approximately $15 and $10 per square foot during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average leasing commissions on the new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 2% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2019 and 4% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2018. The average aggregate value of the tenant concessions, generally consisting of rent abatements, provided in connection with new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 0.4% and 0.5% of the future aggregate base rental revenue over the lease terms during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rent abatements were, or will be, recognized in our results of operations under the straight-line method over the lease term regardless of when payments are due.\n \u2022 $289,000 increase resulting from a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and; \n \u2022 an unfavorable change of approximately $1.6 million due to a decrease in net income plus/minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt premium, stock-based compensation, hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs and gains on sales of real estate assets), as discussed above. This decrease was due primarily to $1.7 million of income recorded during 2018 in connection a lease termination agreement on a single-tenant MOB located in Texas, that terminated a lease that was scheduled to expire in July, 2020; \n \u2022 Government regulations, including changes in the reimbursement levels under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \n \u2022 spent $820,000 to fund equity investments in various unconsolidated LLCs; \n \u2022 Recent legislation, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act ( PPPHCE Act\u201d), has provided grant funding to hospitals and other healthcare providers to assist them during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and the federal government may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional stimulus measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance our tenants will receive under the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our tenants' operations or how they will affect operations of our tenants' competitors. Moreover, we are unable to assess the extent to which anticipated negative impacts on our tenants (and, in turn, us) arising from the COVID-19 pandemic will be offset by amounts or benefits received or to be received under the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act. \n (c) Consists of $236.2 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 under the terms of our $350 million Credit Agreement which matures on March 28, 2022. The amount outstanding approximates fair value as of December 31, 2020. \n \u2022 a favorable change of $711,000 in lease and other receivables; \nIncluded in our other operating expenses are expenses related to the consolidated medical office buildings and two vacant hospital facilities (as discussed herein), which totaled $19.8 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating expenses for 2020 and 2019 include expenses associated with the lease expirations at two of our hospital facilities, which are currently vacant, of approximately $677,000 and $370,000 in the aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A large portion of the expenses associated with our consolidated medical office buildings is passed on directly to the tenants either directly as tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses of included in base rental amounts. Tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred and are included as tenant reimbursement revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $44.2 million during 2020 as compared to $42.7 million during 2019. The $1.6 million net increase was attributable to:\n \u2022 received $13.0 million of proceeds related to a new mortgage note payable refinancing that are non-recourse to us (these proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility); \n \u2022 received $211,000 of net cash from the issuance of shares of beneficial interest; \nEffects of Inflation\n2019:\n \u2022 Failure of UHS or the other operators of our hospital facilities to comply with governmental regulations related to the Medicare and Medicaid licensing and certification requirements could have a material adverse impact on our future revenues and the underlying value of the property. \n \u2022 paid $4.2 million on mortgage notes payable that are non-recourse to us, including the repayment of $2.5 million related to a previously outstanding mortgage note payable on one property that was funded utilizing borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, and; \nCredit facilities and mortgage debt\n \u2022 $2.0 million increase resulting from gains recorded during 2019 related to the sale of the Kings Crossing II MOB and the sale of a parcel of land; \n (g) Consists of equity investment and debt financing commitments remaining in connection with our investment at Forney Medical Plaza II. \n\n purported shareholder class actions and shareholder derivative cases, governmental investigations and regulatory actions and the effects of adverse publicity relating to such matters. Since UHS comprised approximately 33% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, and since a subsidiary of UHS is our Advisor, you are encouraged to obtain and review the disclosures contained in the Legal Proceedings section of Universal Health Services, Inc.'s Forms 10-Q and 10-K, as publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those filings are the sole responsibility of UHS and are not incorporated by reference herein. \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n \u2022 spent approximately $8.3 million for additions to real estate investments, consisting primarily of hurricane related repairs at certain MOBs and tenant improvements at various MOBs; \nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:\nThe mortgages are secured by the real property of the buildings as well as property leases and rents. The mortgages outstanding as of December 31, 2020 had a combined carrying value of approximately $59.2 million and a combined fair value of approximately $62.0 million. At December 31, 2019, we had various mortgages, all of which were non-recourse to us, included in our consolidated balance sheet. The combined outstanding balance of these various mortgages was $61.1 million and these mortgages had a combined fair value of approximately $63.1 million.\n \u2022 received $834,000 of cash distributions in excess of income received from our unconsolidated LLCs ($2.6 million of cash distributions received less $1.8 million of equity in income of unconsolidated LLCs), and; \n \u2022 paid $1.7 million of financing costs related to the revolving credit agreement and a new mortgage note payable that is non-recourse to us. \nIncluded in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are hurricane insurance recoveries of approximately $4.5 million consisting of recovery proceeds in excess of the damaged property write-downs. Additionally, during 2018, we recorded approximately $1.2 million of hurricane business interruption insurance recoveries in connection with the damage sustained from Hurricane Harvey. Included in this amount, which covered the period of late August, 2017 through the second quarter of 2018 (after satisfaction of the applicable deductibles), was approximately $500,000 related to the period of August, 2017 through December, 2017.\n \u2022 $563,000 increase in bonus rental revenue related to the UHS hospital facilities, and; \n \u2022 $434,000 decrease resulting from the June 1, 2019 expiration of a lease on a hospital facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas; \n (a) The mortgages are secured by the real property of the buildings as well as property leases and rents. Property-specific debt is detailed above. \n \u2022 The potential indirect impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law on December 22, 2017, which makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and calculation of taxes, which could potentially impact our tenants and jurisdictions, both positively and negatively, in which we do business, as well as the overall investment thesis for REITs. \nNet cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million during 2019 as compared to $8.0 million during 2018. The factors contributing to the $16.5 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2019 are detailed above.\n \u2022 seven hospital facilities consisting of three acute care, one behavioral health care and three specialty hospitals (two of which are currently vacant); \nBelow is a reconciliation of our reported net income to FFO for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nWe are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis. The excise tax equals 4% of the amount by which 85% of our ordinary income plus 95% of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year, as defined. No provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due.\n \u2022 Due to COVID-19 restrictions and its impact on the economy, we may experience a decrease in prospective tenants which could unfavorably impact the volume of new leases, as well as the renewal rate of existing leases. The COVID-19 pandemic may delay our construction projects which could result in increased costs and delay the timing of opening and rental payments from those projects, although no such delays have yet occurred. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, as well as risks associated with disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact us from a financing perspective; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, COVID-19 vaccinations have begun to be administered and while we expect that administration of vaccines will assist in easing the number of COVID-19 cases, the pace at which this is likely to occur is difficult to predict. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results during 2020, we believe that developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially have a material adverse impact on our future financial results. \n \u2022 paid $1.9 million on mortgage notes payable that are non-recourse to us; \nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity\n \u2022 A continuation in the deterioration in general economic conditions which has resulted in increases in the number of people unemployed and/or insured and likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance; as a result, the operators of our facilities may experience declines in patient volumes which could result in decreased occupancy rates at our medical office buildings. \n \u2022 Should we be unable to comply with the strict income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, utilizing only cash generated by operating activities, we would be required to generate cash from other sources which could adversely affect our financial condition. \n \u2022 $1.95 million decrease resulting from gains recorded during 2019 related to the sale of the Kings Crossing II MOB and the sale of a parcel of land; \nInflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we and the operators of our hospital facilities cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our/their ability to contain future expense increases. Depending on general economic and labor market conditions, the operators of our hospital facilities may experience unfavorable labor market conditions, including a shortage of nurses which may cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. Their ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit their ability to increase prices. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us.\n \u2022 $2.27 million increase resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings; \nRental rates, tenant improvement costs and rental concessions vary from property to property based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the current occupancy and age of our buildings, local overall economic conditions, proximity to hospital campuses and the vacancy rates, rental rates and capacity of our competitors in the market. In connection with lease renewals executed during each year, the weighted-average rental rates, as compared to rental rates on the expired leases, decreased by approximately 1% during 2020 and remained relatively unchanged during 2019. The weighted-average tenant improvement costs associated with new or renewed leases was approximately $18 and $15 per square foot during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average leasing commissions on the new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 3% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2020 and 2% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2019. The average aggregate value of the tenant concessions, generally consisting of rent abatements, provided in connection with new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 0.9% and 0.4% of the future aggregate base rental revenue over the lease terms during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rent abatements were, or will be, recognized in our results of operations under the straight-line method over the lease term regardless of when payments are due.\nResults of Operations\n2019:\n\n \u2022 spent approximately $5.1 million to acquire the Bellin Health Family Medicine Center, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions; \n \u2022 The outcome and effects of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, UHS or the other operators of our facilities. UHS and its subsidiaries are subject to legal actions, \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are determined based on comparable land sales for land and replacement costs adjusted for physical and market obsolescence for the improvements. The fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are also determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property based on assumptions that a market participant would use, which is similar to methods used by independent appraisers. In addition, there is intangible value related to having tenants leasing space in the purchased property, which is referred to as in-place lease value. Such value results primarily from the buyer of a leased property avoiding the costs associated with leasing the property and also avoiding rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the hypothetical lease-up period. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases.\nThe $25.1 million of cash used in financing activities during 2019 consisted of:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $19.4 million as compared to $19.0 million during 2019. The $483,000 increase was primarily attributable to:\nIn determining and monitoring our dividend level on a quarterly basis, our management and Board of Trustees consider many factors in determining the amount of dividends to be paid each period. These considerations primarily include: (i) the minimum required amount of dividends to be paid in order to maintain our REIT status; (ii) the current and projected operating results of our properties, including those owned in LLCs, and; (iii) our future capital commitments and debt repayments, including those of our LLCs. Based upon the information discussed above, as well as consideration of projections and forecasts of our future operating cash flows, management and the Board of Trustees have determined that our operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund our dividend payments.

We are required to build these facilities pursuant to agreements with third parties. \nInterest expense increased $556,000 during 2019 to $10.53 million as compared to $9.98 million during 2018. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a $717,000 increase in interest expense on our revolving credit agreement resulting from an increase in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement (3.5% during 2019 as compared to 3.3% during 2018), as well as an increase in our average outstanding borrowings ($198.3 million during 2019 as compared to $191.4 million during 2018); (ii) a $58,000 net increase in interest expense related to interest rate swaps/caps; (iii) a $120,000 decrease in mortgage interest expense, resulting primarily from the repayment of a mortgage loans during 2018 and 2019, and; (iv) $99,000 of other combined net decreases in interest expense.\n \u2022 $581,000 of other combined net decreases, including an increase in interest expense due primarily to increases in our average outstanding borrowings, and average cost of borrowings, pursuant to our revolving credit agreement. \n2018:\nOther Operating Results\n \u2022 There can be no assurance that if any of the announced or proposed changes described above are implemented there will not be negative financial impact on the operators of our hospitals, which material effects may include a potential decrease in the market for health care services or a decrease in the ability of the operators of our hospitals to receive reimbursement for health care services provided which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the operators of our properties, and, thus, our business. \n2020:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $42.7 million during 2019 as compared to $42.9 million during 2018. The $275,000 decrease was attributable to:\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing $350 million revolving credit agreement (which had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit as of December 31, 2020); (ii) borrowings under or refinancing of existing third-party debt pursuant to mortgage loan agreements entered into by our consolidated and unconsolidated LLCs/LPs; (iii) the issuance of equity pursuant to our at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) equity issuance program, and/or; (iv) the issuance of other long-term debt.\n \u2022 a favorable change of $299,000 in leasing costs paid; \nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, pursuant to the terms of a global settlement with our commercial property insurance carrier, we received $5.5 million of additional insurance recovery proceeds bringing the aggregate hurricane-related insurance recoveries to $12.5 million. The aggregate insurance recovery proceeds, which are net of applicable deductibles, covered substantially all of the costs incurred related to the remediation, repair and reconstruction of each of these properties as well business interruption recoveries for the lost income related to each of these properties during the period they were non-operational.\nThe following table summarizes the schedule of maturities of our outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility ( Credit Agreement\u201d), the outstanding mortgages applicable to our properties recorded on a consolidated basis and our other contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n (d) Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and the loans which are non-recourse to us, remain outstanding until the stated maturity date of the debt agreements at the same interest rates which were in effect as of December 31, 2020. We have the right to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, without penalty. Interest payments are expected to be paid utilizing cash flows from operating activities or borrowings under our revolving Credit Agreement. \n2018:\nPlease see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for completed transactions.\n \u2022 received approximately $2.8 million of combined cash proceeds from the sales of real estate assets consisting of an MOB located in Kingwood, Texas, and a parcel of land. \nAsset Impairment: We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\n \u2022 an unfavorable change of $710,000 in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to the timing of disbursements; \n \u2022 paid $235,000 to repurchase shares of our common stock in connection with income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation. \nIn considering whether to classify a property as held for sale, we consider factors such as whether management has committed to a plan to sell the property, the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition for a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value, the sale of the property is probable, and actions required for management to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will made to the plan. If all the criteria are met, we classify the property as held for sale. Upon being classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization related to the property ceases and it is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assets and related liabilities of the property are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Only those assets held for sale that constitute a strategic shift or that will have a major effect on our operations are classified as discontinued operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $19.0 million as compared to $24.2 million during 2018. The $5.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to:\n \u2022 an unfavorable change of $1.8 million in tenant reserves, deposits and deferred and prepaid rents, primarily resulting from cash received in 2018 from various tenants as reimbursement for their share of the cost of certain tenant improvements; \nYear ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 Changes in, or inadvertent violations of, tax laws and regulations and other factors than can affect REITs and our status as a REIT. \n \u2022 spent $192,000 for hurricane related remediation expenses; \n \u2022 other combined net favorable changes of $796,000. \n \u2022 spent $2.1 million to fund equity investments in unconsolidated LLCs/LPs; \n \u2022 Our ownership interest in five LLCs/LPs in which we hold non-controlling equity interests. In addition, pursuant to the operating and/or partnership agreements of the four LLCs/LPs in which we continue to hold non-controlling ownership interests, the third-party member and the Trust, at any time, potentially subject to certain conditions, have the right to make an offer ( Offering Member\u201d) to the other member(s) ( Non-Offering Member\u201d) in which it either agrees to: (i) sell the entire ownership interest of the Offering Member to the Non-Offering Member ( Offer to Sell\u201d) at a price as determined by the Offering Member ( Transfer Price\u201d), or; (ii) purchase the entire ownership interest of the Non-Offering Member ( Offer to Purchase\u201d) at the equivalent proportionate Transfer Price. The Non-Offering Member has 60 to 90 days to either: (i) purchase the entire ownership interest of the Offering Member at the Transfer Price, or; (ii) sell its entire ownership interest to the Offering Member at the equivalent proportionate Transfer Price.

Our hospital leases require all building operating expenses, including maintenance, real estate taxes and other costs, to be paid by the lessee. In addition, certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions, which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount. In addition, most of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes. These provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation. To the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions, our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.\n2020:\nPlease refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting, for additional information regarding certain of our hospital facilities including Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus; Evansville, Indiana; Corpus Christi, Texas, and; Kindred Hospital Chicago Central.\n \u2022 A favorable change of $2.5 million due to an increase in net income plus/minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation and amortization, amortization related to above/below market leases, amortization of debt premium, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation and gains on sales of real estate assets), as discussed above; \nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value or third party appraisals.\nOur FFO increased $2.2 million, or $.16 per diluted share, during 2020 as compared to 2019 due to: (i) a favorable impact of $2.3 million, or $.17 per diluted share, resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings; (ii) a favorable impact of $565,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in bonus rentals; (iii) other combined net increases of $1.4 million, or $.10 per diluted share, partially offset by; (iv) an unfavorable impact of $2.0 million, or $.15 per diluted share, related to the above-mentioned vacancies at two of our hospitals as a result of lease expirations on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 (excluding the related interest expense impact).\nDuring 2019, $16.5 million of net cash was used in investing activities as follows:\nThe $33.3 million of cash used in financing activities during 2018 consisted of:\nITEM 7.\nWe are a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) that commenced operations in 1986. We invest in healthcare and human service related facilities currently including acute care hospitals, behavioral health care hospitals, specialty hospitals, free-standing emergency departments, childcare centers and medical/office buildings. As of February 25, 2021, we have seventy-two real estate investments or commitments in twenty states consisting of:\n \u2022 Pending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law resulted in across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending on March 1, 2013, including Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued these 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement. The CARES Act suspended payment reductions between May 1 and December 31, 2020, in exchange for extended cuts through 2030. The CAA extended the suspension of payment reductions until March 31, 2021. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward. We also cannot predict the effect these enactments will have on the operators of our properties (including UHS), and thus, our business. \n \u2022 a favorable change of $1.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of disbursements, and; \n \u2022 A substantial portion of our revenues are dependent upon one operator, UHS, which comprised approximately 33%, 31% and 30% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We cannot assure you that subsidiaries of UHS will renew the leases on our three acute care hospitals (two of which are scheduled to expire in December, 2021 and one of which is scheduled to expire in December, 2026) and two FEDs at existing lease rates or fair market value lease rates. In addition, if subsidiaries of UHS exercise their options to purchase the respective leased hospital facilities and FEDs upon expiration of the lease terms or otherwise, our future revenues and results of operations could decrease if we were unable to earn a favorable rate of return on the sale proceeds received, as compared to the rental revenue currently earned pursuant to these leases. Please see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting, for additional information related to a potential transaction with a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS in connection with Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million during 2019, as compared to $33.3 million during 2018. The factors contributing to the $25.1 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2019 are detailed above.\n \u2022 spent $28.3 million for additions to real estate investments, including $22.2 million of construction costs related to a newly constructed, 100-bed behavioral health care hospital located in Clive, Iowa, that was substantially completed and received a temporary certificate of occupancy in late December, 2020, and tenant improvements at various MOBs; \nTenants representing approximately 99% of our occupied square footage have paid their rents through December 31, 2020. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through December 31, 2020, we believe that the potentially adverse impact that the pandemic may have on our future operations and financial results of our tenants, and in turn ours, will depend upon many factors, most of which are beyond our, or our tenants', ability to control or predict. Since the underlying businesses in each of our properties are operated by the tenants, we can provide no assurance that the businesses will continue to operate in the future, or stay current with their lease obligations.\nForward Looking Statements\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n \u2022 $565,000 increase in bonus rentals earned on the three hospital facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS; \n \u2022 An increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. Legislation has already been enacted that has eliminated the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was part of the original Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the Legislation\u201d). President Biden is expected to undertake executive actions that will strengthen the Legislation and may reverse the policies of the prior administration. The Trump Administration had directed the issuance of final rules (i) enabling the formation of association health plans that would be exempt from certain Legislation requirements such as the provision of essential health benefits; (ii) expanding the availability of short-term, limited duration health insurance, (iii) eliminating cost-sharing reduction \n \u2022 Real estate market factors, including without limitation, the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates, changes in interest rates as well as an increase in the development of medical office condominiums in certain markets. \nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders, will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses.\n \u2022 $1.7 million decrease resulting from the income recorded during 2018 in connection with a lease termination agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2018 related to a single tenant MOB located in Texas that terminated a lease that was scheduled to expire in July, 2020; \nThe $17.4 million of cash used in financing activities during 2020 consisted primarily of:\n( CARES Act\u201d). Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 include bonus rental attributable to revenues recorded by these three hospitals in connection with CARES Act grants.\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition, including the operating results of our lessees and the facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS, could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.\nSince the bonus rents earned by us on the three acute care hospitals leased to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Universal Health Services, Inc., are computed based upon a computation that compares each hospital's current quarter revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year, we could experience significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on these properties should those hospitals experience significant declines in patient volumes and revenues. These hospitals believe that, to the extent that they experience revenue declines and increased expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as ultimately measured over the life of the pandemic, they are eligible for emergency fund grants as provided for by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n (a.) All mortgage loans require monthly principal payments through maturity and either fully amortize or include a balloon principal payment upon maturity. \n \u2022 paid $221,000 to repurchase shares of our common stock in connection with income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation; \nAt December 31, 2020, we had $236.2 million of outstanding borrowings and $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement. We had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The carrying amount and fair value of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement was $236.2 million at December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements. The average amount outstanding under our Credit Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $219.1 million, $198.3 million and $191.4 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 2.4%, 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, including commitment fees and interest rate swaps/caps. At December 31, 2019, we had $213.0 million of outstanding borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit agreement and $87.0 million of available borrowing capacity.\nTotal revenues increased $1.0 million, or 1.3%, during 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase was due primarily to: (i) a $563,000 increase in the bonus rental revenue generated on the UHS hospital facilities; (ii) a $718,000 increase resulting from the increased rental rate in connection with a short-term lease covering the period of June 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019 on a hospital facility located in Evansville, Indiana, that was vacated on September 30, 2019 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting), and; (iii) a $428,000 decrease resulting from the June 1, 2019 lease expiration and tenant vacancy at a hospital facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas, (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting).\n \u2022 Lost revenues resulting from the exercise of purchase options, lease expirations and renewals and other transactions (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting for additional disclosure related to lease expirations and subsequent vacancies that occurred during the second and third quarters of 2019 on two hospital facilities. \n \u2022 paid $467,000 of financing costs related to the revolving credit agreement, including amendment fees, and; \nAs of December 31, 2020 we are party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and equity and debt financing commitments. Our outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020 totaled $5.6 million related to Grayson Properties II. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than equity and debt financing commitments.\nDuring 2019, we had a total of 62 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings as indicated in Item 2. Properties, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 24% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (17% related to renewed leases and 7% related to new leases). During 2018, we had a total of 34 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 17% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (14% related to renewed leases and 3% related to new leases).\n \u2022 spent approximately $4.1 million to acquire the Beaumont Medical Sleep Center Building, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions; \nNet cash used in investing activities\n \u2022 paid $38.0 million of dividends; \nReflected below are the components of our interest expense which amounted to $8.3 million during 2020, $10.5 million during 2019 and $10.0 million during 2018 (amounts in thousands):\n payments to insurers that would otherwise offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for health plan enrollees at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level; (iv) relaxing requirements for state innovation waivers that could reduce enrollment in the individual and small group markets and lead to additional enrollment in short-term, limited duration insurance and association health plans; (v) incentivizing the use of health reimbursement arrangements by employers to permit employees to purchase health insurance in the individual market, and; (vi) directing the issuance of federal rulemaking by executive agencies to increase transparency of healthcare price and quality information. The uncertainty resulting from these Executive Branch policies has led to reduced Exchange enrollment in 2018 and 2019 and is expected to further worsen the individual and small group market risk pools in future years. It is also anticipated that these policies, to the extent that they remain as implemented, may create additional cost and reimbursement pressures on hospitals, including ours. In addition, while attempts to repeal the entirety of the Legislation have not been successful to date, a key provision of the Legislation was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and on December 14, 2018, a federal U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled the entire Legislation is unconstitutional. That ruling was stayed and has been appealed. On December 18, 2019, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to strike down the Legislation individual mandate as unconstitutional and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court in Texas to determine which Legislation provisions should be stricken with the mandate. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear, during the 2020-2021 term, two consolidated cases, filed by the State of California and the United States House of Representatives, asking the Supreme Court to review the ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was heard on November 10, 2020, and a ruling is expected in 2021. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice announced that it has withdrawn support for the challenge before the Supreme Court. We are unable to predict the final outcome of this matter which has caused greater uncertainty regarding the future status of the Legislation. If all or any parts of the Legislation are ultimately found to be unconstitutional, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the operators of our properties, and, thus, our business. \nAn other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated LLC is recognized when the carrying value of the investment is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value, including projected declines in cash flow. To the extent impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 Fluctuations in the value of our common stock. \n \u2022 received $229,000 of net cash from the issuance of shares of beneficial interest; \nAs indicated in the cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities sections of the statements of cash flows, there were various other sources and uses of cash during each of the last three years. From time to time, various other sources and uses of cash may include items such as investments and advances made to/from LLCs, additions to real estate investments, acquisitions/divestiture of properties, net borrowings/repayments of debt, and proceeds generated from the issuance of equity. Therefore, in any given period, the funding source for our dividend payments is not wholly dependent on the operating cash flow generated by our properties. Rather, our dividends as well as our capital reinvestments into our existing properties, acquisitions of real property and other investments are funded based upon the aggregate net cash inflows or outflows from all sources and uses of cash from the properties we own either in whole or through LLCs, as outlined above.\n \u2022 repaid $23.4 million on mortgage notes payable that are non-recourse to us (one of which was subsequently refinanced with a new $13.0 million mortgage), and; \n \u2022 received $6.5 million of cash in excess of income from LLCs, including $5.2 million of cash proceeds generated from a construction loan obtained by Grayson Properties II during the second quarter of 2020. \nOur FFO decreased $1.0 million, or $.08 per diluted share, during 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to: (i) a decrease of approximately $1.7 million, or $.12 per diluted share, resulting from a lease termination agreement entered into during 2018 on a single-tenant medical office building located in Texas (this agreement terminated a lease that was scheduled to expire in July, 2020); (ii) a decrease of approximately $500,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from business interruption insurance recovery proceeds recorded during 2018 that related to the period of August through December of 2017; (iii) an increase of approximately $400,000, or $.03 per diluted share, consisting of non-recurring repairs and remediation expenses incurred during 2018 at one of our medical office buildings; (iv) an increase of approximately $563,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in bonus rent from UHS hospital facilities, and; (v) other combined net increase of approximately $275,000, or $.02 per diluted share.\n \u2022 Under the Legislation, hospitals are required to make public a list of their standard charges, and effective January 1, 2019, CMS has required that this disclosure be in machine-readable format and include charges for all hospital items and services and average charges for diagnosis-related groups. On November 27, 2019, CMS published a final rule on Price Transparency Requirements for Hospitals to Make Standard Charges Public.\u201d This rule took effect on January 1, 2021 and requires all hospitals to also make public their payor-specific negotiated rates, minimum negotiated rates, maximum negotiated rates, and cash for all items and services, including individual items and services and service packages, that could be provided by a hospital to a patient. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in daily monetary penalties. \nThe fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be level 2\u201d in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosure in connection with debt instruments. Changes in market rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of debt, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.\n \u2022 spent $2.3 million on the acquisition of the Sand Point Medical Properties building in late December 2020, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions, and; \nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely recognized measure of performance for Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs\u201d). We believe that FFO and FFO per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. We compute FFO, as reflected on the attached Supplemental Schedules, in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we interpret the definition. FFO adjusts for the effects of gains, such as gains on transactions during the periods presented. To the extent a REIT recognizes a gain or loss with respect to the sale of incidental assets, such as the sale of land peripheral to operating properties, the REIT has the option to exclude or include such gains and losses in the calculation of FFO. We have opted to exclude gains and losses from sales of incidental assets in our calculation of FFO. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO should not be used as: (i) an indication of our financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP; (iii) a measure of our liquidity, or; (iv) an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our reported net income to FFO for 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 $1.35 million of other combined net increases, including increased net income experienced at various properties. \n \u2022 paid $35,000 of financing costs. \n \u2022 Our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund future growth of our business. \n \u2022 four free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs\u201d); \n \u2022 Other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nNet cash used in financing activities\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate: Purchase accounting is applied to the assets and liabilities related to all real estate investments acquired from third parties. In accordance with current accounting guidance, we account for our property acquisitions as acquisitions of assets, which requires the capitalization of acquisition costs to the underlying assets and prohibits the recognition of goodwill or bargain purchase gains. The fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, and acquired ground leases, based in each case on their fair values. Loan premiums, in the case of above market rate assumed loans, or loan discounts, in the case of below market assumed loans, are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate.\nFederal Income Taxes: No provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to shareholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal, state or local income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months, including providing sufficient capital to allow us to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nInterest expense decreased $2.27 million during 2020 to $8.26 million as compared to $10.53 million during 2019. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a $2.9 million decrease in the interest expense on our revolving credit agreement resulting from a decrease in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement (1.8% during 2020 as compared to 3.5% during 2019), partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings ($219.1 million during 2020 as compared to $198.3 million during 2019); (ii) a $967,000 net increase in interest expense related to interest rate swaps/caps; (iii) a $101,000 decrease in mortgage interest expense, resulting primarily from the repayment of a mortgage loan during the second quarter of 2019; (iv) a $321,000 decrease in interest expense due to an increase in capitalized interest on major projects, due primarily to the increased construction cost expenditures made during 2020 made in connection with the Clive Behavioral Health facility, and; (v) a $128,000 increase due to an increase in amortization of financing fees.\n \u2022 A continuation of the worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States will likely materially affect the business of our operators, including UHS, which will likely unfavorably impact our future bonus rentals (on the UHS hospital facilities) and may potentially have a negative impact on the future lease renewal terms and the underlying value of the hospital properties. \n \u2022 fifty-seven medical/office buildings, including five owned by unconsolidated LLCs/LPs, and; \nTotal revenues increased $847,000, or 1.1%, during 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was due to: (i) an aggregate net increase of $1.71 million experienced at various properties; (ii) a $565,000 increase in the bonus rentals; (iii) a $311,000 increase resulting from an MOB that was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by; (iv) a $1.74 million decrease resulting from the revenues recorded during 2019 in connection with two hospital facilities that had lease expirations and vacancies in June and September of 2019 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting).\n \u2022 $1.2 million decrease resulting from the Hurricane Harvey related business interruption insurance recovery proceeds received recorded during 2018, including approximately $500,000 which related to 2017; \n \u2022 received $16.6 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \nHurricane Harvey Impact\n \u2022 As part of the CAA, Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The legislation prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received. In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. The legislation requires implementing regulations within a year of enactment. \nThe following table includes a summary of the required compliance ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019, giving effect to the covenants contained in the Credit Agreements in effect on the respective dates (dollar amounts in thousands):\n \u2022 $4.5 million decrease resulting from the Hurricane Harvey related insurance recovery proceeds received in excess of property damage write-offs recorded during 2018; \n \u2022 $2.04 million decrease resulting from lease expirations on two hospital facilities located in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Evansville, Indiana, that occurred on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively (each facility has remained vacant since the respective date of lease expiration); \n \u2022 spent $3.2 million in equity investments in unconsolidated LLCs; \n \u2022 spent approximately $12.3 million for capital additions to real estate investments, including $5.9 million related to the construction of the above-mentioned facility located in Clive, Iowa, as well as tenant improvements at various MOBs; \n\n</table>\n \u2022 A subsidiary of UHS is our Advisor and our officers are all employees of a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS, which may create the potential for conflicts of interest. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly impact the United States in mid-March, 2020. As a result of various policies implemented by the federal and state governments, and varying by individual state, many non-essential businesses in the nation were closed for varying time periods. We believe that by June 30, 2020, substantially all of our tenants had resumed operations of their businesses.\n\nWe declared and paid dividends of $38.0 million during 2020, $37.4 million during 2019 and $36.8 million during 2018. During 2020, the $44.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.2 million greater than the $38.0 million of dividends paid during 2020. During 2019, the $42.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.2 million greater than the $37.4 million of dividends paid during 2019. During 2018, the $42.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.1 million greater than the $36.8 million of dividends paid during 2018.\nIncluded in our other operating expenses are expenses related to the consolidated medical office buildings and two vacant hospital facilities (as discussed herein), which totaled $19.1 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating expenses for 2019 include expenses associated with the lease expirations at two of our hospital facilities, which are currently vacant, of approximately $370,000 in the aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2019. A large portion of the expenses associated with our consolidated medical office buildings is passed on directly to the tenants either directly as tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses of included in base rental amounts. Tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred and are included as tenant reimbursement revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nContractual Obligations:\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Revolving B Facility will bear interest, at our option, at one, two, three or six months LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.85% to 2.10% or at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.10%. The Credit Agreement defines Base Rate\u201d as the greatest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%. The initial applicable margin is 1.95% for LIBOR loans and 0.95% for Base Rate loans. A facility fee of 0.15% to 0.35% will be charged on the total commitment of the Revolving B Facility of the Credit Agreement. The margins over LIBOR, Base Rate and the facility fee are based upon our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 1.95%, the margin over the Base Rate was 0.95% and the facility fee was 0.20%.\n \u2022 $600,000 increase related to a short-term lease on a hospital facility located in Evansville, Indiana (lease term of June 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019), that was entered into at a substantially increased lease rate as compared to the original lease which expired on May 31, 2019; \n \u2022 a favorable change of $182,000 in tenant reserves, deposits and deferred and prepaid rents, and; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 received $15.4 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \n \u2022 In certain of our markets, the general real estate market has been unfavorably impacted by increased competition/capacity and decreases in occupancy and rental rates which may adversely impact our operating results and the underlying value of our properties. \n \u2022 The impact of property values and results of operations of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes. \nNet cash used in financing activities\nThis report contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.

Represents interest paid to us by the counterparties pursuant to two interest rate caps with a combined notional amount of $60 million, which expired in March 2019. \nOverview\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Revolving A Facility will bear interest, at our option, at one, two, three or six-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.35% or at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.35%. The Credit Agreement defines Base Rate\u201d as the greater of: (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%. A facility fee of 0.15% to 0.35% will be charged on the total commitment of the Revolving A Facility of the Credit Agreement. The margins over LIBOR, Base Rate and the facility fee are based upon our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 1.20%, the margin over the Base Rate was 0.20%, and the facility fee was 0.20%. The Credit Agreement also provides for options to extend the maturity date and borrowing availability for two additional six-month periods for the Revolving A Facility.\n \u2022 paid $37.4 million of dividends; \n \u2022 Future operations and financial results of our tenants, and in turn ours, will likely be materially impacted by numerous factors and future developments related to COVID-19. Such factors and developments include, but are not limited to, the length of time and severity of the spread of the pandemic; the volume of cancelled or rescheduled elective procedures and the volume of COVID-19 patients treated by the operators of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities; measures our tenants are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of government and administrative regulation, including travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, quarantines, the promotion of social distancing, business shutdowns and limitations on business activity; changes in patient volumes at our tenants' hospitals and other healthcare facilities due to patients' general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system; the impact of stimulus on the health care industry and our tenants; changes in patient volumes and payer mix caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions (including increases in uninsured and underinsured patients as the result of business closings and layoffs); potential disruptions to clinical staffing and shortages and disruptions related to supplies required for our tenants' employees and patients, including equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment, or PPE; potential increases to expenses incurred by our tenants related to staffing, supply chain or other expenditures; the impact of our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms; disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact our ability to access capital or increase associated borrowing costs; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher sustained rates of unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer spending and confidence. There may be significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on our hospital properties leased to subsidiaries of UHS to the extent that each hospital continues to experience significant decline in patient volumes and revenues. These factors may result in the inability or unwillingness on the part of some of our tenants to make timely payment of their rent to us at current levels or to seek to amend or terminate their leases which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our occupancy levels and our revenue and cash flow and the value of our properties, and potentially, our ability to maintain our dividend at current levels. \nDisclosures Related to Certain Hospital Facilities\n \u2022 The individual and collective impact of the changes made by the CARES Act on REITs and their security holders are uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time; it is also possible additional legislation could be enacted in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which may affect the holders of our securities. \nIn June 2020, we entered into the first amendment (the First Amendment\u201d) to the revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, an additional tranche of revolving credit commitments in the amount of $50 million, designated as the Revolving B Facility\u201d, was established thereby increasing the aggregate revolving credit commitment to $350 million from $300 million. The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in March 2022, provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million, including a $40 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $30 million sublimit for swingline/short-term loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Trust. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in and liens on all equity interests in certain of the Trust's wholly-owned subsidiaries. The remainder of the revolving credit commitments provided under the Credit Agreement that were in effect prior to giving effect to the First Amendment, has been designated as the Revolving A Facility\u201d.\n\nDuring 2018, $8.0 million of net cash was used in investing activities as follows:\nDuring 2020, we had a total of 39 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings as indicated in Item 2. Properties, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 30% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (21% related to renewed leases and 9% related to new leases). During 2019, we had a total of 62 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 24% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (17% related to renewed leases and 7% related to new leases).\n \u2022 Competition for properties include, but are not limited to, other REITs, private investors and firms, banks and other companies, including UHS. In addition, we may face competition from other REITs for our tenants. \n \u2022 A number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level to the operators of our facilities, including UHS. No assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of our operators. \n (b) Consists of non-recourse debt with an aggregate fair value of approximately $62.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Changes in market rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of debt, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow. Excludes $39.7 million of combined third-party debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, that is non-recourse to us, at the unconsolidated LLCs in which we hold various non-controlling ownership interests (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). \nIn late August 2017, five of our medical office buildings located in the Houston, Texas area, incurred extensive water damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Until various times during the second quarter of 2018, these properties were temporarily closed and non-operational as we continued to reconstruct and restore them to operational condition. As of June 30, 2018, reconstruction on all of the occupied space in these properties had been completed and operations had resumed.\n \u2022 The potential unfavorable impact on our business of the deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a further worsening of credit and/or capital market conditions, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain capital which may be required to fund the future growth of our business and refinance existing debt with near term maturities. \n \u2022 received $23.3 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \nAs indicated on the following table, we have various mortgages, all of which are non-recourse to us and are not cross-collateralized, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):\nNet cash used in investing activities was $27.2 million during 2020 as compared to $16.5 million during 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on certain indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and other investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions and dividends and other distributions. The Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants regarding the Trust's ratio of total debt to total assets, the fixed charge coverage ratio, the ratio of total secured debt to total asset value, the ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value, and minimum tangible net worth, as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which may trigger an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all of the covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We also believe that we would remain in compliance if, assuming that the majority of the potential new borrowings will be used to fund investments, the full amount of our commitment was borrowed.\n \u2022 The operators of our facilities face competition from other health care providers, including physician owned facilities and other competing facilities, including certain facilities operated by UHS but the real property of which is not owned by us. Such competition is experienced in markets including, but not limited to, McAllen, Texas, the site of our McAllen Medical Center, a 370-bed acute care hospital, and Riverside County, California, the site of our Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus, a 130-bed acute care hospital. \nManagement routinely monitors and analyzes the Trust's capital structure in an effort to maintain the targeted balance among capital resources including the level of borrowings pursuant to our $350 million revolving credit facility, the level of borrowings pursuant to non-recourse mortgage debt secured by the real property of our properties and our level of equity including consideration of additional equity issuances pursuant to our ATM equity issuance program. This ongoing analysis considers factors such as the current debt market and interest rate environment, the current/projected occupancy and financial performance of our properties, the current loan-to-value ratio of our properties, the Trust's current stock price, the capital resources required for anticipated acquisitions and the expected capital to be generated by anticipated divestitures. This analysis, together with consideration of the Trust's current balance of revolving credit agreement borrowings, non-recourse mortgage borrowings and equity, assists management in deciding which capital resource to utilize when events such as refinancing of specific debt components occur or additional funds are required to finance the Trust's growth.\n (e) Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2020, as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements -Lease Accounting, in connection with ground leases at fourteen of our consolidated properties. \nIn allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) estimated fair market lease rates from the perspective of a market participant for the corresponding in-place leases, measured, for above-market leases, over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease and, for below-market leases, over a period equal to the initial term plus any below market fixed rate renewal periods. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values, also referred to as acquired lease obligations, are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial terms of the respective leases.\nAs indicated on our consolidated statements of cash flows, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of $44.2 million during 2020, $42.7 million during 2019 and $42.9 million during 2018. As also indicated on our statements of cash flows, non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization expense, amortization related to above/below market leases, amortization of debt premium, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs (as applicable) and gains on sales of real estate assets (as applicable), are the primary differences between our net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each year.\nDuring 2020, $27.2 million of net cash was used in investing activities as follows:\nThroughout the common areas of many properties in our portfolio, we have implemented COVID-19 risk mitigating actions such as, enhanced cleaning protocols including supplemental cleaning and sanitizing of high-touch points, limiting points of entry at certain facilities, and coordinating with health care providers to assess or screen patients prior to entering certain of our MOBs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $17.4 million during 2020, as compared to $25.1 million during 2019.\nAdditional cash flow and dividends paid information for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n (c.) Represents net interest paid to us by the counterparties pursuant to an interest rates SWAPs with a notional amount of $50 million. \n \u2022 received $318,000 of cash distributions in excess of income received from our unconsolidated LLCs ($2.1 million of cash distributions received less $1.8 million of equity in income of unconsolidated LLCs), and; \nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:\nRental rates, tenant improvement costs and rental concessions vary from property to property based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the current occupancy and age of our buildings, local overall economic conditions, proximity to hospital campuses and the vacancy rates, rental rates and capacity of our competitors in the market. In connection with lease renewals executed during each year, the weighted-average rental rates, as compared to rental rates on the expired leases, remained relatively unchanged during 2019 and decreased 3% during 2018. The weighted-average tenant improvement costs associated with new or renewed leases was approximately $15 and $10 per square foot during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average leasing commissions on the new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 2% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2019 and 4% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2018. The average aggregate value of the tenant concessions, generally consisting of rent abatements, provided in connection with new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 0.4% and 0.5% of the future aggregate base rental revenue over the lease terms during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rent abatements were, or will be, recognized in our results of operations under the straight-line method over the lease term regardless of when payments are due.\n \u2022 $289,000 increase resulting from a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and; \n \u2022 an unfavorable change of approximately $1.6 million due to a decrease in net income plus/minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt premium, stock-based compensation, hurricane insurance recovery proceeds in excess of damaged property write-downs and gains on sales of real estate assets), as discussed above. This decrease was due primarily to $1.7 million of income recorded during 2018 in connection a lease termination agreement on a single-tenant MOB located in Texas, that terminated a lease that was scheduled to expire in July, 2020; \n \u2022 Government regulations, including changes in the reimbursement levels under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \n \u2022 spent $820,000 to fund equity investments in various unconsolidated LLCs; \n \u2022 Recent legislation, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act ( PPPHCE Act\u201d), has provided grant funding to hospitals and other healthcare providers to assist them during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and the federal government may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional stimulus measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance our tenants will receive under the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our tenants' operations or how they will affect operations of our tenants' competitors. Moreover, we are unable to assess the extent to which anticipated negative impacts on our tenants (and, in turn, us) arising from the COVID-19 pandemic will be offset by amounts or benefits received or to be received under the CARES Act and the PPPHCE Act. \n (c) Consists of $236.2 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 under the terms of our $350 million Credit Agreement which matures on March 28, 2022. The amount outstanding approximates fair value as of December 31, 2020. \n \u2022 a favorable change of $711,000 in lease and other receivables; \nIncluded in our other operating expenses are expenses related to the consolidated medical office buildings and two vacant hospital facilities (as discussed herein), which totaled $19.8 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating expenses for 2020 and 2019 include expenses associated with the lease expirations at two of our hospital facilities, which are currently vacant, of approximately $677,000 and $370,000 in the aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A large portion of the expenses associated with our consolidated medical office buildings is passed on directly to the tenants either directly as tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses of included in base rental amounts. Tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred and are included as tenant reimbursement revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $44.2 million during 2020 as compared to $42.7 million during 2019.

Those filings are the sole responsibility of UHS and are not incorporated by reference herein. \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n \u2022 spent approximately $8.3 million for additions to real estate investments, consisting primarily of hurricane related repairs at certain MOBs and tenant improvements at various MOBs; \nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:\nThe mortgages are secured by the real property of the buildings as well as property leases and rents. The mortgages outstanding as of December 31, 2020 had a combined carrying value of approximately $59.2 million and a combined fair value of approximately $62.0 million. At December 31, 2019, we had various mortgages, all of which were non-recourse to us, included in our consolidated balance sheet. The combined outstanding balance of these various mortgages was $61.1 million and these mortgages had a combined fair value of approximately $63.1 million.\n \u2022 received $834,000 of cash distributions in excess of income received from our unconsolidated LLCs ($2.6 million of cash distributions received less $1.8 million of equity in income of unconsolidated LLCs), and; \n \u2022 paid $1.7 million of financing costs related to the revolving credit agreement and a new mortgage note payable that is non-recourse to us. \nIncluded in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 are hurricane insurance recoveries of approximately $4.5 million consisting of recovery proceeds in excess of the damaged property write-downs. Additionally, during 2018, we recorded approximately $1.2 million of hurricane business interruption insurance recoveries in connection with the damage sustained from Hurricane Harvey. Included in this amount, which covered the period of late August, 2017 through the second quarter of 2018 (after satisfaction of the applicable deductibles), was approximately $500,000 related to the period of August, 2017 through December, 2017.\n \u2022 $563,000 increase in bonus rental revenue related to the UHS hospital facilities, and; \n \u2022 $434,000 decrease resulting from the June 1, 2019 expiration of a lease on a hospital facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas; \n (a) The mortgages are secured by the real property of the buildings as well as property leases and rents. Property-specific debt is detailed above. \n \u2022 The potential indirect impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law on December 22, 2017, which makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and calculation of taxes, which could potentially impact our tenants and jurisdictions, both positively and negatively, in which we do business, as well as the overall investment thesis for REITs. \nNet cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million during 2019 as compared to $8.0 million during 2018. The factors contributing to the $16.5 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2019 are detailed above.\n \u2022 seven hospital facilities consisting of three acute care, one behavioral health care and three specialty hospitals (two of which are currently vacant); \nBelow is a reconciliation of our reported net income to FFO for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nWe are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis. The excise tax equals 4% of the amount by which 85% of our ordinary income plus 95% of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year, as defined. No provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due.\n \u2022 Due to COVID-19 restrictions and its impact on the economy, we may experience a decrease in prospective tenants which could unfavorably impact the volume of new leases, as well as the renewal rate of existing leases. The COVID-19 pandemic may delay our construction projects which could result in increased costs and delay the timing of opening and rental payments from those projects, although no such delays have yet occurred. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, as well as risks associated with disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact us from a financing perspective; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in the markets our properties are located resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, COVID-19 vaccinations have begun to be administered and while we expect that administration of vaccines will assist in easing the number of COVID-19 cases, the pace at which this is likely to occur is difficult to predict. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results during 2020, we believe that developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially have a material adverse impact on our future financial results. \n \u2022 paid $1.9 million on mortgage notes payable that are non-recourse to us; \nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity\n \u2022 A continuation in the deterioration in general economic conditions which has resulted in increases in the number of people unemployed and/or insured and likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance; as a result, the operators of our facilities may experience declines in patient volumes which could result in decreased occupancy rates at our medical office buildings. \n \u2022 Should we be unable to comply with the strict income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, utilizing only cash generated by operating activities, we would be required to generate cash from other sources which could adversely affect our financial condition. \n \u2022 $1.95 million decrease resulting from gains recorded during 2019 related to the sale of the Kings Crossing II MOB and the sale of a parcel of land; \nInflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we and the operators of our hospital facilities cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our/their ability to contain future expense increases. Depending on general economic and labor market conditions, the operators of our hospital facilities may experience unfavorable labor market conditions, including a shortage of nurses which may cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate. Their ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit their ability to increase prices. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us.\n \u2022 $2.27 million increase resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings; \nRental rates, tenant improvement costs and rental concessions vary from property to property based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the current occupancy and age of our buildings, local overall economic conditions, proximity to hospital campuses and the vacancy rates, rental rates and capacity of our competitors in the market. In connection with lease renewals executed during each year, the weighted-average rental rates, as compared to rental rates on the expired leases, decreased by approximately 1% during 2020 and remained relatively unchanged during 2019. The weighted-average tenant improvement costs associated with new or renewed leases was approximately $18 and $15 per square foot during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average leasing commissions on the new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 3% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2020 and 2% of base rental revenue over the term of the leases during 2019. The average aggregate value of the tenant concessions, generally consisting of rent abatements, provided in connection with new and renewed leases commencing during each year was approximately 0.9% and 0.4% of the future aggregate base rental revenue over the lease terms during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rent abatements were, or will be, recognized in our results of operations under the straight-line method over the lease term regardless of when payments are due.\nResults of Operations\n2019:\n\n \u2022 spent approximately $5.1 million to acquire the Bellin Health Family Medicine Center, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions; \n \u2022 The outcome and effects of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, UHS or the other operators of our facilities. UHS and its subsidiaries are subject to legal actions, \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are determined based on comparable land sales for land and replacement costs adjusted for physical and market obsolescence for the improvements. The fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are also determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant\u201d value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property based on assumptions that a market participant would use, which is similar to methods used by independent appraisers. In addition, there is intangible value related to having tenants leasing space in the purchased property, which is referred to as in-place lease value. Such value results primarily from the buyer of a leased property avoiding the costs associated with leasing the property and also avoiding rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the hypothetical lease-up period. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases.\nThe $25.1 million of cash used in financing activities during 2019 consisted of:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $19.4 million as compared to $19.0 million during 2019. The $483,000 increase was primarily attributable to:\nIn determining and monitoring our dividend level on a quarterly basis, our management and Board of Trustees consider many factors in determining the amount of dividends to be paid each period. These considerations primarily include: (i) the minimum required amount of dividends to be paid in order to maintain our REIT status; (ii) the current and projected operating results of our properties, including those owned in LLCs, and; (iii) our future capital commitments and debt repayments, including those of our LLCs. Based upon the information discussed above, as well as consideration of projections and forecasts of our future operating cash flows, management and the Board of Trustees have determined that our operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund our dividend payments. Future dividend levels will be determined based upon the factors outlined above with consideration given to our projected future results of operations.\n \u2022 four preschool and childcare centers. \n (f) Consists of the remaining estimated construction costs of two new construction projects, consisting of a 100-bed behavioral health care facility located in Clive, Iowa, and a 75,000 rentable square foot MOB located in Denison, Texas, both of which are were substantially completed in late 2020. We are required to build these facilities pursuant to agreements with third parties. \nInterest expense increased $556,000 during 2019 to $10.53 million as compared to $9.98 million during 2018. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a $717,000 increase in interest expense on our revolving credit agreement resulting from an increase in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement (3.5% during 2019 as compared to 3.3% during 2018), as well as an increase in our average outstanding borrowings ($198.3 million during 2019 as compared to $191.4 million during 2018); (ii) a $58,000 net increase in interest expense related to interest rate swaps/caps; (iii) a $120,000 decrease in mortgage interest expense, resulting primarily from the repayment of a mortgage loans during 2018 and 2019, and; (iv) $99,000 of other combined net decreases in interest expense.\n \u2022 $581,000 of other combined net decreases, including an increase in interest expense due primarily to increases in our average outstanding borrowings, and average cost of borrowings, pursuant to our revolving credit agreement. \n2018:\nOther Operating Results\n \u2022 There can be no assurance that if any of the announced or proposed changes described above are implemented there will not be negative financial impact on the operators of our hospitals, which material effects may include a potential decrease in the market for health care services or a decrease in the ability of the operators of our hospitals to receive reimbursement for health care services provided which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the operators of our properties, and, thus, our business. \n2020:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $42.7 million during 2019 as compared to $42.9 million during 2018. The $275,000 decrease was attributable to:\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing $350 million revolving credit agreement (which had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit as of December 31, 2020); (ii) borrowings under or refinancing of existing third-party debt pursuant to mortgage loan agreements entered into by our consolidated and unconsolidated LLCs/LPs; (iii) the issuance of equity pursuant to our at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) equity issuance program, and/or; (iv) the issuance of other long-term debt.\n \u2022 a favorable change of $299,000 in leasing costs paid; \nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, pursuant to the terms of a global settlement with our commercial property insurance carrier, we received $5.5 million of additional insurance recovery proceeds bringing the aggregate hurricane-related insurance recoveries to $12.5 million. The aggregate insurance recovery proceeds, which are net of applicable deductibles, covered substantially all of the costs incurred related to the remediation, repair and reconstruction of each of these properties as well business interruption recoveries for the lost income related to each of these properties during the period they were non-operational.\nThe following table summarizes the schedule of maturities of our outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility ( Credit Agreement\u201d), the outstanding mortgages applicable to our properties recorded on a consolidated basis and our other contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n (d) Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and the loans which are non-recourse to us, remain outstanding until the stated maturity date of the debt agreements at the same interest rates which were in effect as of December 31, 2020. We have the right to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, without penalty. Interest payments are expected to be paid utilizing cash flows from operating activities or borrowings under our revolving Credit Agreement. \n2018:\nPlease see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for completed transactions.\n \u2022 received approximately $2.8 million of combined cash proceeds from the sales of real estate assets consisting of an MOB located in Kingwood, Texas, and a parcel of land. \nAsset Impairment: We review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\n \u2022 an unfavorable change of $710,000 in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to the timing of disbursements; \n \u2022 paid $235,000 to repurchase shares of our common stock in connection with income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation. \nIn considering whether to classify a property as held for sale, we consider factors such as whether management has committed to a plan to sell the property, the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition for a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value, the sale of the property is probable, and actions required for management to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will made to the plan. If all the criteria are met, we classify the property as held for sale. Upon being classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization related to the property ceases and it is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assets and related liabilities of the property are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Only those assets held for sale that constitute a strategic shift or that will have a major effect on our operations are classified as discontinued operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $19.0 million as compared to $24.2 million during 2018. The $5.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to:\n \u2022 an unfavorable change of $1.8 million in tenant reserves, deposits and deferred and prepaid rents, primarily resulting from cash received in 2018 from various tenants as reimbursement for their share of the cost of certain tenant improvements; \nYear ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 Changes in, or inadvertent violations of, tax laws and regulations and other factors than can affect REITs and our status as a REIT. \n \u2022 spent $192,000 for hurricane related remediation expenses; \n \u2022 other combined net favorable changes of $796,000. \n \u2022 spent $2.1 million to fund equity investments in unconsolidated LLCs/LPs; \n \u2022 Our ownership interest in five LLCs/LPs in which we hold non-controlling equity interests. In addition, pursuant to the operating and/or partnership agreements of the four LLCs/LPs in which we continue to hold non-controlling ownership interests, the third-party member and the Trust, at any time, potentially subject to certain conditions, have the right to make an offer ( Offering Member\u201d) to the other member(s) ( Non-Offering Member\u201d) in which it either agrees to: (i) sell the entire ownership interest of the Offering Member to the Non-Offering Member ( Offer to Sell\u201d) at a price as determined by the Offering Member ( Transfer Price\u201d), or; (ii) purchase the entire ownership interest of the Non-Offering Member ( Offer to Purchase\u201d) at the equivalent proportionate Transfer Price. The Non-Offering Member has 60 to 90 days to either: (i) purchase the entire ownership interest of the Offering Member at the Transfer Price, or; (ii) sell its entire ownership interest to the Offering Member at the equivalent proportionate Transfer Price. The closing of the transfer must occur within 60 to 90 days of the acceptance by the Non-Offering Member. \nInterest Expense:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n \u2022 other combined net unfavorable changes of $704,000. \n \u2022 The issues facing the health care industry that affect the operators of our facilities, including UHS, such as: changes in, or the ability to comply with, existing laws and government regulations; unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement by third party payors or government programs, including Medicare (including, but not limited to, the potential unfavorable impact of future reductions to Medicare reimbursements and Medicaid reimbursements (most states have reported significant budget deficits that have, in the past, resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding to the operators of our facilities, including UHS); demographic changes; the ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms; an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of patient accounts; decreasing in-patient admission trends; technological and pharmaceutical improvements that may increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for, health care, and; the ability to attract and retain qualified medical personnel, including physicians. \nMost of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Our hospital leases require all building operating expenses, including maintenance, real estate taxes and other costs, to be paid by the lessee. In addition, certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions, which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount. In addition, most of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes. These provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation. To the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions, our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.\n2020:\nPlease refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting, for additional information regarding certain of our hospital facilities including Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus; Evansville, Indiana; Corpus Christi, Texas, and; Kindred Hospital Chicago Central.\n \u2022 A favorable change of $2.5 million due to an increase in net income plus/minus the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (depreciation and amortization, amortization related to above/below market leases, amortization of debt premium, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation and gains on sales of real estate assets), as discussed above; \nWe generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value or third party appraisals.\nOur FFO increased $2.2 million, or $.16 per diluted share, during 2020 as compared to 2019 due to: (i) a favorable impact of $2.3 million, or $.17 per diluted share, resulting from a decrease in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings; (ii) a favorable impact of $565,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in bonus rentals; (iii) other combined net increases of $1.4 million, or $.10 per diluted share, partially offset by; (iv) an unfavorable impact of $2.0 million, or $.15 per diluted share, related to the above-mentioned vacancies at two of our hospitals as a result of lease expirations on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 (excluding the related interest expense impact).\nDuring 2019, $16.5 million of net cash was used in investing activities as follows:\nThe $33.3 million of cash used in financing activities during 2018 consisted of:\nITEM 7.\nWe are a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) that commenced operations in 1986. We invest in healthcare and human service related facilities currently including acute care hospitals, behavioral health care hospitals, specialty hospitals, free-standing emergency departments, childcare centers and medical/office buildings. As of February 25, 2021, we have seventy-two real estate investments or commitments in twenty states consisting of:\n \u2022 Pending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law resulted in across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending on March 1, 2013, including Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued these 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement. The CARES Act suspended payment reductions between May 1 and December 31, 2020, in exchange for extended cuts through 2030. The CAA extended the suspension of payment reductions until March 31, 2021. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward. We also cannot predict the effect these enactments will have on the operators of our properties (including UHS), and thus, our business. \n \u2022 a favorable change of $1.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of disbursements, and; \n \u2022 A substantial portion of our revenues are dependent upon one operator, UHS, which comprised approximately 33%, 31% and 30% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We cannot assure you that subsidiaries of UHS will renew the leases on our three acute care hospitals (two of which are scheduled to expire in December, 2021 and one of which is scheduled to expire in December, 2026) and two FEDs at existing lease rates or fair market value lease rates. In addition, if subsidiaries of UHS exercise their options to purchase the respective leased hospital facilities and FEDs upon expiration of the lease terms or otherwise, our future revenues and results of operations could decrease if we were unable to earn a favorable rate of return on the sale proceeds received, as compared to the rental revenue currently earned pursuant to these leases. Please see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting, for additional information related to a potential transaction with a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS in connection with Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million during 2019, as compared to $33.3 million during 2018. The factors contributing to the $25.1 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2019 are detailed above.\n \u2022 spent $28.3 million for additions to real estate investments, including $22.2 million of construction costs related to a newly constructed, 100-bed behavioral health care hospital located in Clive, Iowa, that was substantially completed and received a temporary certificate of occupancy in late December, 2020, and tenant improvements at various MOBs; \nTenants representing approximately 99% of our occupied square footage have paid their rents through December 31, 2020. Although COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through December 31, 2020, we believe that the potentially adverse impact that the pandemic may have on our future operations and financial results of our tenants, and in turn ours, will depend upon many factors, most of which are beyond our, or our tenants', ability to control or predict. Since the underlying businesses in each of our properties are operated by the tenants, we can provide no assurance that the businesses will continue to operate in the future, or stay current with their lease obligations.\nForward Looking Statements\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n \u2022 $565,000 increase in bonus rentals earned on the three hospital facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS; \n \u2022 An increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. Legislation has already been enacted that has eliminated the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was part of the original Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the Legislation\u201d). President Biden is expected to undertake executive actions that will strengthen the Legislation and may reverse the policies of the prior administration. The Trump Administration had directed the issuance of final rules (i) enabling the formation of association health plans that would be exempt from certain Legislation requirements such as the provision of essential health benefits; (ii) expanding the availability of short-term, limited duration health insurance, (iii) eliminating cost-sharing reduction \n \u2022 Real estate market factors, including without limitation, the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates, changes in interest rates as well as an increase in the development of medical office condominiums in certain markets. \nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.

Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 include bonus rental attributable to revenues recorded by these three hospitals in connection with CARES Act grants.\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition, including the operating results of our lessees and the facilities leased to subsidiaries of UHS, could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.\nSince the bonus rents earned by us on the three acute care hospitals leased to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Universal Health Services, Inc., are computed based upon a computation that compares each hospital's current quarter revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year, we could experience significant declines in future bonus rental revenue earned on these properties should those hospitals experience significant declines in patient volumes and revenues. These hospitals believe that, to the extent that they experience revenue declines and increased expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as ultimately measured over the life of the pandemic, they are eligible for emergency fund grants as provided for by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n (a.) All mortgage loans require monthly principal payments through maturity and either fully amortize or include a balloon principal payment upon maturity. \n \u2022 paid $221,000 to repurchase shares of our common stock in connection with income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation; \nAt December 31, 2020, we had $236.2 million of outstanding borrowings and $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement. We had $108.2 million of available borrowing capacity, net of the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The carrying amount and fair value of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreement was $236.2 million at December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements. The average amount outstanding under our Credit Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $219.1 million, $198.3 million and $191.4 million, respectively, with corresponding effective interest rates of 2.4%, 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, including commitment fees and interest rate swaps/caps. At December 31, 2019, we had $213.0 million of outstanding borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit agreement and $87.0 million of available borrowing capacity.\nTotal revenues increased $1.0 million, or 1.3%, during 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase was due primarily to: (i) a $563,000 increase in the bonus rental revenue generated on the UHS hospital facilities; (ii) a $718,000 increase resulting from the increased rental rate in connection with a short-term lease covering the period of June 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019 on a hospital facility located in Evansville, Indiana, that was vacated on September 30, 2019 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting), and; (iii) a $428,000 decrease resulting from the June 1, 2019 lease expiration and tenant vacancy at a hospital facility located in Corpus Christi, Texas, (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting).\n \u2022 Lost revenues resulting from the exercise of purchase options, lease expirations and renewals and other transactions (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements - Lease Accounting for additional disclosure related to lease expirations and subsequent vacancies that occurred during the second and third quarters of 2019 on two hospital facilities. \n \u2022 paid $467,000 of financing costs related to the revolving credit agreement, including amendment fees, and; \nAs of December 31, 2020 we are party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and equity and debt financing commitments. Our outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020 totaled $5.6 million related to Grayson Properties II. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than equity and debt financing commitments.\nDuring 2019, we had a total of 62 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings as indicated in Item 2. Properties, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 24% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (17% related to renewed leases and 7% related to new leases). During 2018, we had a total of 34 new or renewed leases related to the medical office buildings, in which we have significant investments, some of which are accounted for by the equity method. These leases comprised approximately 17% of the aggregate rentable square feet of these properties (14% related to renewed leases and 3% related to new leases).\n \u2022 spent approximately $4.1 million to acquire the Beaumont Medical Sleep Center Building, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions; \nNet cash used in investing activities\n \u2022 paid $38.0 million of dividends; \nReflected below are the components of our interest expense which amounted to $8.3 million during 2020, $10.5 million during 2019 and $10.0 million during 2018 (amounts in thousands):\n payments to insurers that would otherwise offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for health plan enrollees at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level; (iv) relaxing requirements for state innovation waivers that could reduce enrollment in the individual and small group markets and lead to additional enrollment in short-term, limited duration insurance and association health plans; (v) incentivizing the use of health reimbursement arrangements by employers to permit employees to purchase health insurance in the individual market, and; (vi) directing the issuance of federal rulemaking by executive agencies to increase transparency of healthcare price and quality information. The uncertainty resulting from these Executive Branch policies has led to reduced Exchange enrollment in 2018 and 2019 and is expected to further worsen the individual and small group market risk pools in future years. It is also anticipated that these policies, to the extent that they remain as implemented, may create additional cost and reimbursement pressures on hospitals, including ours. In addition, while attempts to repeal the entirety of the Legislation have not been successful to date, a key provision of the Legislation was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and on December 14, 2018, a federal U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled the entire Legislation is unconstitutional. That ruling was stayed and has been appealed. On December 18, 2019, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to strike down the Legislation individual mandate as unconstitutional and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court in Texas to determine which Legislation provisions should be stricken with the mandate. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear, during the 2020-2021 term, two consolidated cases, filed by the State of California and the United States House of Representatives, asking the Supreme Court to review the ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was heard on November 10, 2020, and a ruling is expected in 2021. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice announced that it has withdrawn support for the challenge before the Supreme Court. We are unable to predict the final outcome of this matter which has caused greater uncertainty regarding the future status of the Legislation. If all or any parts of the Legislation are ultimately found to be unconstitutional, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the operators of our properties, and, thus, our business. \nAn other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated LLC is recognized when the carrying value of the investment is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value, including projected declines in cash flow. To the extent impairment has occurred, the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 Fluctuations in the value of our common stock. \n \u2022 received $229,000 of net cash from the issuance of shares of beneficial interest; \nAs indicated in the cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities sections of the statements of cash flows, there were various other sources and uses of cash during each of the last three years. From time to time, various other sources and uses of cash may include items such as investments and advances made to/from LLCs, additions to real estate investments, acquisitions/divestiture of properties, net borrowings/repayments of debt, and proceeds generated from the issuance of equity. Therefore, in any given period, the funding source for our dividend payments is not wholly dependent on the operating cash flow generated by our properties. Rather, our dividends as well as our capital reinvestments into our existing properties, acquisitions of real property and other investments are funded based upon the aggregate net cash inflows or outflows from all sources and uses of cash from the properties we own either in whole or through LLCs, as outlined above.\n \u2022 repaid $23.4 million on mortgage notes payable that are non-recourse to us (one of which was subsequently refinanced with a new $13.0 million mortgage), and; \n \u2022 received $6.5 million of cash in excess of income from LLCs, including $5.2 million of cash proceeds generated from a construction loan obtained by Grayson Properties II during the second quarter of 2020. \nOur FFO decreased $1.0 million, or $.08 per diluted share, during 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to: (i) a decrease of approximately $1.7 million, or $.12 per diluted share, resulting from a lease termination agreement entered into during 2018 on a single-tenant medical office building located in Texas (this agreement terminated a lease that was scheduled to expire in July, 2020); (ii) a decrease of approximately $500,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from business interruption insurance recovery proceeds recorded during 2018 that related to the period of August through December of 2017; (iii) an increase of approximately $400,000, or $.03 per diluted share, consisting of non-recurring repairs and remediation expenses incurred during 2018 at one of our medical office buildings; (iv) an increase of approximately $563,000, or $.04 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in bonus rent from UHS hospital facilities, and; (v) other combined net increase of approximately $275,000, or $.02 per diluted share.\n \u2022 Under the Legislation, hospitals are required to make public a list of their standard charges, and effective January 1, 2019, CMS has required that this disclosure be in machine-readable format and include charges for all hospital items and services and average charges for diagnosis-related groups. On November 27, 2019, CMS published a final rule on Price Transparency Requirements for Hospitals to Make Standard Charges Public.\u201d This rule took effect on January 1, 2021 and requires all hospitals to also make public their payor-specific negotiated rates, minimum negotiated rates, maximum negotiated rates, and cash for all items and services, including individual items and services and service packages, that could be provided by a hospital to a patient. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in daily monetary penalties. \nThe fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be level 2\u201d in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosure in connection with debt instruments. Changes in market rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of debt, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.\n \u2022 spent $2.3 million on the acquisition of the Sand Point Medical Properties building in late December 2020, as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements - New Construction, Acquisitions and Dispositions, and; \nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a widely recognized measure of performance for Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs\u201d). We believe that FFO and FFO per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. We compute FFO, as reflected on the attached Supplemental Schedules, in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we interpret the definition. FFO adjusts for the effects of gains, such as gains on transactions during the periods presented. To the extent a REIT recognizes a gain or loss with respect to the sale of incidental assets, such as the sale of land peripheral to operating properties, the REIT has the option to exclude or include such gains and losses in the calculation of FFO. We have opted to exclude gains and losses from sales of incidental assets in our calculation of FFO. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO should not be used as: (i) an indication of our financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP; (iii) a measure of our liquidity, or; (iv) an indicator of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our reported net income to FFO for 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 $1.35 million of other combined net increases, including increased net income experienced at various properties. \n \u2022 paid $35,000 of financing costs. \n \u2022 Our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund future growth of our business. \n \u2022 four free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs\u201d); \n \u2022 Other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nNet cash used in financing activities\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate: Purchase accounting is applied to the assets and liabilities related to all real estate investments acquired from third parties. In accordance with current accounting guidance, we account for our property acquisitions as acquisitions of assets, which requires the capitalization of acquisition costs to the underlying assets and prohibits the recognition of goodwill or bargain purchase gains. The fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, and acquired ground leases, based in each case on their fair values. Loan premiums, in the case of above market rate assumed loans, or loan discounts, in the case of below market assumed loans, are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate.\nFederal Income Taxes: No provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and intend to continue to remain so qualified. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to shareholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal, state or local income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months, including providing sufficient capital to allow us to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nInterest expense decreased $2.27 million during 2020 to $8.26 million as compared to $10.53 million during 2019. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a $2.9 million decrease in the interest expense on our revolving credit agreement resulting from a decrease in our average cost of borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement (1.8% during 2020 as compared to 3.5% during 2019), partially offset by an increase in our average outstanding borrowings ($219.1 million during 2020 as compared to $198.3 million during 2019); (ii) a $967,000 net increase in interest expense related to interest rate swaps/caps; (iii) a $101,000 decrease in mortgage interest expense, resulting primarily from the repayment of a mortgage loan during the second quarter of 2019; (iv) a $321,000 decrease in interest expense due to an increase in capitalized interest on major projects, due primarily to the increased construction cost expenditures made during 2020 made in connection with the Clive Behavioral Health facility, and; (v) a $128,000 increase due to an increase in amortization of financing fees.\n \u2022 A continuation of the worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States will likely materially affect the business of our operators, including UHS, which will likely unfavorably impact our future bonus rentals (on the UHS hospital facilities) and may potentially have a negative impact on the future lease renewal terms and the underlying value of the hospital properties. \n \u2022 fifty-seven medical/office buildings, including five owned by unconsolidated LLCs/LPs, and; \nTotal revenues increased $847,000, or 1.1%, during 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was due to: (i) an aggregate net increase of $1.71 million experienced at various properties; (ii) a $565,000 increase in the bonus rentals; (iii) a $311,000 increase resulting from an MOB that was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by; (iv) a $1.74 million decrease resulting from the revenues recorded during 2019 in connection with two hospital facilities that had lease expirations and vacancies in June and September of 2019 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Lease Accounting).\n \u2022 $1.2 million decrease resulting from the Hurricane Harvey related business interruption insurance recovery proceeds received recorded during 2018, including approximately $500,000 which related to 2017; \n \u2022 received $16.6 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \nHurricane Harvey Impact\n \u2022 As part of the CAA, Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The legislation prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received. In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. The legislation requires implementing regulations within a year of enactment. \nThe following table includes a summary of the required compliance ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019, giving effect to the covenants contained in the Credit Agreements in effect on the respective dates (dollar amounts in thousands):\n \u2022 $4.5 million decrease resulting from the Hurricane Harvey related insurance recovery proceeds received in excess of property damage write-offs recorded during 2018; \n \u2022 $2.04 million decrease resulting from lease expirations on two hospital facilities located in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Evansville, Indiana, that occurred on June 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively (each facility has remained vacant since the respective date of lease expiration); \n \u2022 spent $3.2 million in equity investments in unconsolidated LLCs; \n \u2022 spent approximately $12.3 million for capital additions to real estate investments, including $5.9 million related to the construction of the above-mentioned facility located in Clive, Iowa, as well as tenant improvements at various MOBs; \n\n</table>\n \u2022 A subsidiary of UHS is our Advisor and our officers are all employees of a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHS, which may create the potential for conflicts of interest. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly impact the United States in mid-March, 2020. As a result of various policies implemented by the federal and state governments, and varying by individual state, many non-essential businesses in the nation were closed for varying time periods. We believe that by June 30, 2020, substantially all of our tenants had resumed operations of their businesses.\n\nWe declared and paid dividends of $38.0 million during 2020, $37.4 million during 2019 and $36.8 million during 2018. During 2020, the $44.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.2 million greater than the $38.0 million of dividends paid during 2020. During 2019, the $42.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.2 million greater than the $37.4 million of dividends paid during 2019. During 2018, the $42.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $6.1 million greater than the $36.8 million of dividends paid during 2018.\nIncluded in our other operating expenses are expenses related to the consolidated medical office buildings and two vacant hospital facilities (as discussed herein), which totaled $19.1 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating expenses for 2019 include expenses associated with the lease expirations at two of our hospital facilities, which are currently vacant, of approximately $370,000 in the aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2019. A large portion of the expenses associated with our consolidated medical office buildings is passed on directly to the tenants either directly as tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses of included in base rental amounts. Tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred and are included as tenant reimbursement revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nContractual Obligations:\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Revolving B Facility will bear interest, at our option, at one, two, three or six months LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.85% to 2.10% or at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.10%. The Credit Agreement defines Base Rate\u201d as the greatest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and; (c) one month LIBOR plus 1%. The initial applicable margin is 1.95% for LIBOR loans and 0.95% for Base Rate loans. A facility fee of 0.15% to 0.35% will be charged on the total commitment of the Revolving B Facility of the Credit Agreement. The margins over LIBOR, Base Rate and the facility fee are based upon our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin over the LIBOR rate was 1.95%, the margin over the Base Rate was 0.95% and the facility fee was 0.20%.\n \u2022 $600,000 increase related to a short-term lease on a hospital facility located in Evansville, Indiana (lease term of June 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019), that was entered into at a substantially increased lease rate as compared to the original lease which expired on May 31, 2019; \n \u2022 a favorable change of $182,000 in tenant reserves, deposits and deferred and prepaid rents, and; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 received $15.4 million of additional net borrowings on our revolving line of credit; \n \u2022 In certain of our markets, the general real estate market has been unfavorably impacted by increased competition/capacity and decreases in occupancy and rental rates which may adversely impact our operating results and the underlying value of our properties. \n \u2022 The impact of property values and results of operations of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes. \nNet cash used in financing activities\nThis report contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.

estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in healthcare and human service related facilities. As of February 2021, it has 72 properties in 20 states.\n\n2020 Financial Highlights\n- Net income was $19.4 million in 2020 compared to $19.0 million in 2019. The increase was due to higher bonus rentals, lower interest expense, and growth across various properties.\n\n- Funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share was $3.36 in 2020 versus $3.20 in 2019. The increase was driven by lower interest expense and higher bonus rentals, partially offset by vacancies at two hospitals. \n\n- 39 new or renewed leases were signed in 2020 relating to medical office buildings (MOBs), covering 30% of total rentable square footage.  \n\nCOVID-19 Impact\n- COVID-19 did not have a material adverse impact on 2020 financial results, but could negatively affect future results depending on factors like patient volumes, government regulations, and business conditions.\n\n- UHT's largest tenant, Universal Health Services (UHS), accounted for 33% of total revenues in 2020. Performance of UHS hospitals affects UHT's bonus rentals and lease renewals.\n\nCapital Structure \n- UHT has capital resources to fund operations, acquisitions, and dividends over the next 12 months from operating cash flow, borrowing capacity on its credit facility, ability to refinance debt, and ability to issue equity.\n\nThat covers some of the major points from the MD&A report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
