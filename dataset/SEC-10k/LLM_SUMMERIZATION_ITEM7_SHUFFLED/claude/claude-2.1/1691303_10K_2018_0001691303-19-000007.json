Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please see Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a large scale, low cost U.S.-based producer and exporter of premium met coal operating two highly productive underground mines in Alabama. As of December 31, 2018, Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, our two operating mines, had approximately 108.3 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and our undeveloped Blue Creek Energy Mine contained 103.0 million metric tons of recoverable reserves. As a result of our high quality coal, our realized price has historically been in line with, or at a slight discount to, the Platts Index. Our HCC, mined from the Southern Appalachian portion of the Blue Creek coal seam, is characterized by low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, and LV to MV. These qualities make our coal ideally suited as a coking coal for the manufacture of steel.\nWe sell substantially all of our met coal production to steel producers. Met coal, which is converted to coke, is a critical input in the steel production process. Met coal is both consumed domestically in the countries where it is produced and exported by several of the largest producing countries, such as China, Australia, the United States, Canada and Russia. Therefore, demand for our coal will be highly correlated to conditions in the global steelmaking industry. The steelmaking industry's demand for met coal is affected by a number of factors, including the cyclical nature of that industry's business, technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant reduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for met coal, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Similarly, if alternative ingredients are used in substitution for met coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for met coal would materially decrease, which could also materially adversely affect demand for our met coal.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur results on a Predecessor\u201d basis relate to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Warrior Met Coal, LLC from Walter Energy in the Asset Acquisition and the related periods ending on or prior to March 31, 2016. Our results on a Successor\u201d basis relate to Warrior Met Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries for periods beginning as of April 1, 2016 and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. after giving effect to our corporate conversion on April 12, 2017 from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation. Our results for the Predecessor and Successor periods have been separated by a vertical line to identify these different bases of accounting.\nThe historical costs and expenses reflected in the Predecessor combined results of operations include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Walter Energy. Substantially all of the Predecessor's senior management were employed by Walter Energy and certain functions critical to the Predecessor's operations were centralized and managed by Walter Energy. Historically, the centralized functions have included executive senior management, financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, accounting, shared services, information technology, tax, risk management, treasury, legal, human resources, and strategy and development. The costs of each of these services have been allocated to the Predecessor on the basis of the Predecessor's relative headcount, revenue and total assets to that of Walter Energy.\nThe combined financial statements of our Predecessor included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other historical Predecessor combined financial information presented and discussed in this management's discussion and analysis may not be indicative of what our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would actually have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Financial Statements\nAsset Acquisition\nOn March 31, 2016, we consummated the acquisition of the Predecessor on a debt free basis with minimum legacy liabilities. The Asset Acquisition included Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, which management believes to be two of the highest quality and lowest cost met coal mines in the United States. Prior to the Asset Acquisition, the Company had no operations and nominal assets. We acquired the Predecessor for an aggregate cash consideration of $50.8 million and the release of claims associated with the 2011 Credit Agreement and Walter Energy's 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. In connection with the closing of the Asset Acquisition and in exchange for a portion of the outstanding first lien debt, Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders were entitled to receive, on a pro rata basis, a distribution of our Class A Units. We accounted for the Asset Acquisition as a business combination under Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations.\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we incurred transaction costs related to professional fees in the amount of $10.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, which is recorded in transaction and other costs on the Statement of Operations.\nRights Offerings\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we also conducted the Rights Offerings. The Rights Offerings gave Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders and certain qualified unsecured creditors the option to purchase an aggregate 2,500,004 Class B Units for $80.00 per unit and irrevocably commit to purchase, on the same pro rata basis, Class A Units in one or more capital raising transactions at such later date and on such terms and subject to such conditions as determined by a supermajority vote of our board of managers. The $200.0 million raised from the Rights Offerings was used to pay cash consideration of $50.8 million for the Asset Acquisition, including repayment of certain debtor-in-possession credit agreements of Walter Energy, to sustain our coal mining operations following consummation of the Asset Acquisition and for general corporate purposes.\nCorporate Conversion and IPO\nOn April 12, 2017, in connection with the IPO, Warrior Met Coal, LLC filed a certificate of conversion, whereby Warrior Met Coal, LLC effected a corporate conversion from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Warrior Met Coal, Inc. As part of the corporate conversion, holders of Class A, Class B Units (which included the Class B Units which had converted into Class A Units) and Class C Units of Warrior Met Coal, LLC received shares of our common stock for each unit held immediately prior to the corporate conversion using an approximate 13.9459-to-one conversion ratio. In connection with this corporate conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation. Pursuant to the Company's certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 140,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. All references in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d to the number of shares and per share amounts of common stock have been retroactively recast to reflect the corporate conversion.\nOn April 19, 2017, the Company completed its IPO, whereby certain selling stockholders sold 16,666,667 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the IPO. All of the net proceeds from the IPO were received by the selling stockholders. The aggregate net proceeds to the selling stockholders in the IPO were $296.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.8 million. The Company paid the offering expenses of $15.9 million on behalf of the selling stockholders. Following the closing of the IPO, 53,442,532 shares of common stock were outstanding. On April 13, 2017, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol HCC\u201d and on April 19, 2017, we closed our IPO.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur primary business, the mining and exporting of met coal for the steel industry, is conducted in one business segment: Mining. All other operations and results are reported under the All Other\u201d category as a reconciling item to consolidated amounts, which includes the business results from our sale of natural gas extracted as a byproduct from our underground coal mines and royalties from our leased properties. Our natural gas and royalty businesses do not meet the criteria in ASC 280, Segment Reporting, to be considered as operating or reportable segments.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) Segment Adjusted EBITDA; (ii) sales\nvolumes and average selling price, which drive coal sales revenue; (iii) cash cost of sales, a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>532,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metric tons sold\n</td> <td>6,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metric tons produced\n</td> <td>7,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross price realization (1)\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average net selling price per metric ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash cost of sales per metric ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,048\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Platts Index, the Australian LV Index, or the Australian HCC Benchmark depending on the time period. The gross price realization for the year ended December 31, 2018 is based on a volume weighted-average Platts Index price, the year December 31, 2017 is based on a volume weighted average of the three-month average of the Platts Index, the Steel Index (\"TSI\") premium coking coal index and the Argus Index on a one month lag during each quarter (the \"Australian LV Index\"), and for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 is based on a volume weighted average Australian HCC Benchmark.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for other revenues, cost of other revenues, depreciation and depletion, selling, general and administrative, and certain transactions or adjustments that the CEO, our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to pay distributions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sales Volumes, Gross Price Realization and Average Net Selling Price\nWe evaluate our operations based on the volume of coal we can safely produce and sell in compliance with regulatory standards, and the prices we receive for our coal. Our sales volume and sales prices are largely dependent upon the terms of our coal sales contracts, for which prices generally are set on daily index averages or a quarterly basis. The volume of coal we sell is also a function of the pricing environment in the international met coal markets and the amounts of LV and MV coal that we sell. We evaluate the price we receive for our coal on two primary metrics: first, our gross price realization and second, our average net selling price per metric ton.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we changed our gross price realization calculation to no longer be based on the quarterly Australian LV Index average due to this index being on a one-month lag basis and not closely correlating with the timing of our\nshipments. Our gross price realization now represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on the blended gross sales of our LV and MV coal, excluding demurrage and quality specification adjustments, as a percentage of the Platts Index daily price. Our gross price realizations reflect the premiums and discounts we achieve on our LV and MV coal versus the Platts Index price because of the high quality premium products we sell into the export markets. In addition, the premiums and discounts in a quarter or year can be impacted by a rising or falling price environment.\nOn a quarterly basis, our blended gross selling price per metric ton may differ from the Platts Index price per metric ton, primarily due to our gross sales price per ton being based on a blended average of gross sales price on our LV and MV coals as compared to the Platts Index price and due to the fact that many of our met coal supply agreements are based on a variety of indices.\nOur average net selling price per metric ton represents our coal net sales revenue divided by total metric tons of coal sold. In addition, our average net selling price per metric ton is net of the previously mentioned demurrage and quality specification adjustments.\nCash Cost of Sales\nWe evaluate our cash cost of sales on a cost per metric ton basis. Cash cost of sales is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to GAAP, are classified in the Statements of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Our cash cost of sales per metric ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the metric tons sold. Cash cost of sales is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight into our operating performance, and reflects how management analyzes our operating performance and compares that performance against other companies on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that cash costs of sales presents a useful measure of our controllable costs and our operational results by including all costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Period-to-period comparisons of cash cost of sales are intended to help management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our Company that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of cost of sales. Cash cost of sales should not be considered an alternative to cost of sales or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Cash cost of sales excludes some, but not all, items that affect cost of sales, and our presentation may vary from the presentations of other companies. As a result, cash cost of sales as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cash cost of sales to total cost of sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>592,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation accretion and valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>(1,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mine No. 4 idle costs (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VEBA contribution (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (operating overhead, etc.)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,843\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>591,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents idle costs incurred, such as electricity, insurance and maintenance labor.

Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments excludes some, but not all, items that affect net loss and our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that presented by other companies.\nThe following table presents a

ended December 31, 2018, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on gross sales, which excludes demurrage and other charges, as a percentage of the Platts Index price. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our realized price per ton based on gross sales as a percentage of the Australian LV Index.\nSales were $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $218.0 million increase in revenues was primarily driven by a $191.8 million increase in revenue due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volume combined with a $26.2 million increase in revenue related to a $3.78 increase in the average selling price per metric ton of met coal.\nOther revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.3 million compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other revenues are comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. The $9.1 million decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a realized loss of $1.8 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2018 combined with a realized gain of $5.4 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) was $716.6 million, or 52.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $592.5 million, or 50.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $124.1 million increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by $100.9 million increase due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volumes coupled with a $24.2 million increase due to a $3.49 increase in the average cash cost of sales per metric ton primarily due to higher spending associated with the increased sales volume.\nCost of other revenues was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $18.3 million decrease is primarily due to a $21.5 million decrease in our asset retirement obligations attributable to the net impact of changes in current estimates of the costs and scope of remaining reclamation work, changes in discount rates and fluctuations in projected mine life estimates.\nDepreciation and depletion was $97.2 million, or 7.1% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $75.4 million, or 6.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $21.8 million increase was driven primarily by an increase in capital expenditures combined with an increase in depletion due to an increase in metric tons produced combined with $4.0 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in the current year on equipment beyond its economic repair.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $36.6 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $36.5 million, or 3.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million increase is driven primarily by an increase in employee bonuses based on our performance through the year end December 31, 2018.\nTransaction and other costs were $9.1 million, or 0.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the New Notes and the Secondary Equity Offerings (as defined in Notes 16 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements). Transaction and other costs were $12.9 million, or 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 which was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and with the issuance of the Existing Notes (as defined in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nInterest expense, net was $37.3 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $30.4 million increase was primarily driven by $36.3 million of additional interest expense on the Notes due to the issuance of $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount on March 1, 2018 and the issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount on November 2, 2017.\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $225.8 million or an effective tax rate of (47.9)% compared to an income tax benefit of $38.6 million or an effective tax rate of (9.27)% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and our continued strong financial performance which contributed to a cumulative three-year income position. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, we released all of our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The release of the valuation allowance primarily resulted in a net income tax benefit of $225.8 million that was recorded in income tax benefit (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in 2019, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective tax rate of 23%-25%. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2034. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing a territorial tax system, limiting the deduction for interest expense, limiting the use of net operating losses generated on or after January 1, 2018 to offset taxable income and repealing the corporate AMT and triggering refunding provisions for existing AMT credits. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we\nrecorded an income tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely lived asset that will now reverse at the new 21% rate.\nOn January 14, 2019, the IRS issued a statement that AMT refunds for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to sequestration which reversed an earlier IRS announcement that refundable AMT credits would be subject to sequestration. As a result, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and recorded a measurement period adjustment recognizing an income tax receivable and related income tax benefit of $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, we have a current income tax receivable of $21.6 million and a non-current income tax receivable of $21.3 million which represents our total AMT credits expected to be received in 2019 to 2022.\nOn March 31, 2016, we experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. As a result of such ownership change, absent an applicable exception to such rules, an annual limitation under Section 382 would apply for federal and certain state income tax purposes with respect to the utilization of NOLs. In 2017, we had requested a private letter ruling ( PLR\u201d) from the IRS to clarify certain matters, that if ruled favorably on by the IRS, would allow us to qualify for an exception to the aforementioned rules limiting its utilization of its NOLs. On September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a favorable PLR. Prior to the issuance of the PLR, we operated and prepared our financial statements based on an assumption that an annual limitation on the utilization of the NOLs existed. Based on the receipt of the favorable PLR, we now believe that we qualify for an exception to such NOL limitation rules and as such, no annual Code Section 382 limitation to the utilization of our federal NOLs applies. As a result of qualifying for such exception and due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, our federal and state NOLs were revised downward to approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations. See \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets\" for additional discussion of this risk.\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>21,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>297,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>244,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>19,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>47,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>20,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and other costs\n</td> <td>13,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>345,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(47,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(1,711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(49,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Met Coal (metric tons in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metric tons sold\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metric tons produced\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross price realization (1)\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average net selling price per metric ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash cost of sales per metric ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark price.

Substantially all of these sales came from Mine No. 7 as Mine No. 4 was idled in early 2016 and reinitiated operations in August of 2016. Also, we restarted a second longwall in Mine No. 7 in October 2016. Our sales were negatively impacted by roof instability issues experienced at Mine No. 7. Beginning in October 2016, we completed mining on the longwall panel where we experienced the roof instability issues and began production on a new longwall panel.\nOther revenues were $21.1 million, and were comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. Cost of other revenues was $19.4 million, representing 6.5% of total revenues and 91.9% of other revenues.\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below), was $244.72 million, or 82.2% of total revenues, and was primarily comprised of met coal sales of 2.4 million metric tons at an average cash cost of sales of $82.84 per metric ton. Our cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned roof instability issues at Mine No. 7, carrying costs of $8.7 million for the idled Mine No. 4, the $25.0 million VEBA contribution and an increase in royalty expense due to an increase in our realized sales price.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $47.4 million, or 15.9% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and depletion of mineral interests.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million, or 6.9% of total revenues, reflecting the benefits of a restructured business without the legacy costs and liabilities which were not assumed in the Asset Acquisition.\nTransaction and other costs associated with the Asset Acquisition and IPO were $13.6 million, or 4.6% of total revenues, of which $10.5 million was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition and $3.1 million was comprised of professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO.\nInterest expense, net of $1.7 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, is comprised of interest on our security agreement and promissory note, and amortization of our ABL Facility origination fees.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor)\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that

Benchmark price.\nSales were $65.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and were comprised of met coal sales of 0.8 million metric tons at an average selling price of $83.85 per metric ton.\nOther revenues were $6.2 million, and were comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. Cost of other revenues was $4.7 million, representing 6.6% of total revenues and 75.4% of other revenues.\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below), was $72.3 million, or 101.3% of total revenues, and was primarily comprised of met coal sales of 0.8 million metric tons at an average cash cost of sales of $69.74 per metric ton. Our cost of sales was negatively impacted by carrying costs of $10.2 million for the idled Mine No. 4.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $29.0 million, or 40.6% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and mine development costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $9.0 million, or 12.6% of total revenues, and were primarily comprised of employee salaries and benefits.\nOther postretirement benefits were $6.2 million, or 8.6% of total revenues, and represent postretirement healthcare benefits of the Predecessor.\nRestructuring cost of $3.4 million, or 4.8% of total revenues, resulted from the Predecessor idling Mine No. 4 and workforce reductions at both Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 and corporate headquarters due to the continued decline in met coal prices.\nInterest expense of $16.6 million, or 23.2% of total revenues, represents interest on liabilities subject to compromise, which were attributed to the Predecessor.\nReorganization items, net, was $7.9 million, or 11.1% of total revenues, and was comprised of an allocation of corporate professional fees incurred by the Predecessor in relation to the Chapter 11 Cases of $11.0 million offset by rejected executory contracts and leases of $18.9 million.\nAn income tax expense of $18.0 thousand was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as a result of the recognition of a full valuation allowance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur sources of cash have been coal and natural gas sales to customers, proceeds received from the Notes Offering and access to our ABL Facility. Historically, our primary uses of cash have been for funding the operations of our coal and natural gas production operations, our capital expenditures, our reclamation obligations, professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition, the Secondary Equity Offerings and our IPO. In addition, we used available cash on hand to repurchase shares of common stock, pay our quarterly dividend, pay the March Special Distribution, pay a portion of the November Special Dividend (as defined below), and pay a portion of the April Special Dividend, each of which reduces or reduced cash and cash equivalents.\nGoing forward, we will need cash to fund debt service payments on our Notes and our other indebtedness and to fund operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. Our ability to fund our capital needs going forward will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, and, in the case of any future strategic investments, capital expenditures or special dividends financed partially or wholly with debt financing, our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital. We believe that our future cash flow from operations, together with cash on our balance sheet and borrowing availability under our ABL Facility, will provide adequate resources to fund our debt service payments and planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.\nIf our cash flows from operations are less than we require, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe we can currently finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, (iii) the current state of the global economy and (iv) restrictions in our ABL Facility, the indenture governing the Notes and any other existing or future debt agreements. There can be no assurance that we will have or continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur available liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was $326.0 million, consisting of $205.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $120.4 million of availability under our ABL Facility (calculated net of $4.6 million of letters of credit\noutstanding at such time). For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $559.4 million, cash flows used in investing activities were $107.6 million and cash flows used in financing activities were $281.6 million.\nAs discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, on September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling that favorably impacts our ability to utilize our NOLs for federal income tax purposes. Prior to the issuance of the private letter ruling, we applied an annual limitation on the utilization of NOLs pursuant to Section 382 of the Code and, accordingly, expected to pay a significantly higher amount of income taxes for 2017. Following the issuance of the private letter ruling, we believe that our NOLs will not be subject to the annual limit of Section 382 as previously applied during 2017. Also, as discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017. We expect that our future free cash flow will meaningfully benefit from the favorable private letter ruling and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to (i) the unlimited use of our $1.1 billion NOLs and (ii) the refunding of AMT credits of approximately $42.9 million, which we expect to receive in 2019 through 2022.\nStatements of Cash Flows\nCash balances were $205.6 million, $35.5 million and $150.0 million at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth, a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the period (in thousands):\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>559,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(107,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(281,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(458,279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,240\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116,392\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for noncash items, such as depreciation and depletion of property, plant and equipment and mineral interests, deferred income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation, non-cash reorganization items, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, net, accretion of asset retirement obligations and changes in net working capital. The timing between the conversion of our billed and unbilled receivables into cash from our customers and disbursements to our vendors is the primary driver of changes in our working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $559.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and was primarily attributed to net income of $696.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $97.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $2.5 million, accretion of asset retirement obligations of $4.6 million, offset partially by an increase in net working capital of $10.7 million, a change in asset retirement obligation due to a change in estimate of $24.6 million and the release of our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of $223.0 million. The increase in our working capital, was primarily attributable to an increase in trade accounts receivable due to higher sales volumes combined with an increase in income tax receivable offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased production and sales volume.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $434.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and\nwas primarily attributed to net income of $455.0 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $75.4 million,\nstock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.9 million and\naccretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.8 million, offset by a net increase in our working capital of $61.0 million. The\nincrease in our working capital was primarily driven by an increase in trade accounts receivables, income tax receivables, other\nreceivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets offset partially by an increase in accounts payable,\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in our accounts receivable was primarily driven by an increase in\nthe average selling price per metric ton of our coal coupled with an increase in metric tons sold. The increase in our long-term\nincome tax receivable was due to refundable AMT credits which will be received in 2019 through 2022 for the 2018 through\n2021 tax years, as a result of changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The increase in inventories was due to the\ncontinued ramp up of production throughout 2017. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to an increase in\ncapitalized deferred longwall move expenses associated with the three longwall moves that occurred during the fourth quarter\nof 2017. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily driven by an\nincrease in expenditures due to the increase in production at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $49.7 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $47.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $2.8 million, offset by a net decrease in our working capital of $17.7 million. The decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by effects of the Asset Acquisition, an increase in trade accounts receivable offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of an increase in sales and an increase in operating costs associated with the reinitiation of Mine No. 4 operations in August 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $40.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor), and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $61.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $29.0 million, non-cash reorganization items of $18.9 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $10.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.2 million, offset partially by a net decrease in our working capital of $1.6 million. The net decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by higher disbursements for accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the period associated with our purchases from vendors, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily comprised of $101.6 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment and $8.9 million of capitalized mine development costs associated with our Mine 4 development. We spent approximately $69.0 million in sustaining capital and spent an additional $33.0 million in other discretionary capital, which included the construction of a new portal at Mine No. 7. The cash capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital accruals and leases of approximately $6.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as\na result of a significant capital investment program that we implemented in 2017 to upgrade all key production equipment to\nfurther improve efficiency and reliability of the mining operations. We spent approximately $62.0 million in sustaining capital,\n$26.0 million in capital for projects that had been deferred in prior years due to low met coal price environments and spent an\nadditional $19.0 million in other discretionary capital, which included the start of construction of a new portal at Mine No. 7\nthat was completed in 2018. The cash capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital accruals and leases of\napproximately $15.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $30.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the cash used in connection with the Asset Acquisition and the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills posted as collateral for the self-insured black lung claims that were assumed in the Asset Acquisition of $17.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor) primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the payment of dividends totaling $360.6 million in the aggregate, common shares repurchased of $38.0 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $3.7 million, retirements of debt of $3.1 million, offset partially by the net proceeds received from the issuance of the New Notes of $128.8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $458.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily\ndue to the payment of the March Special Distribution, November Special Dividend and quarterly dividends totaling $796.9\nmillion in the aggregate, payment of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million, retirements of debt of $3.1 million, offset partially by\nthe net proceeds from the Notes Offering of $344.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $192.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the proceeds received from the Rights Offerings offset by payments of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). Cash flows from financing activities for the Predecessor period primarily represent net transfers to/from Walter Energy and net payments on debt. As cash and the financing of our Predecessor's operations have historically been managed by Walter Energy, the components of net transfers to/from Walter Energy include cash transfers from us to Walter Energy and the payments by Walter Energy to settle our obligations. These transactions are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded.\nCapital Allocation\nOn May 17, 2017, our board of directors adopted the Capital Allocation Policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. The initial quarterly dividend of $2.7 million was paid on June 13, 2017 to stockholders of record on May 30, 2017. The Capital Allocation Policy also states the following: In addition to the regular quarterly dividend and to the extent that the Company generates excess cash that is beyond the then current requirements of the business, our board of directors may consider returning all or a portion of such excess cash to stockholders through a special dividend or implementation of a stock repurchase program. Any future dividends or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to consideration of a number of factors, including business and market conditions, future financial performance and other strategic investment opportunities. The Company will also seek to optimize its capital structure to improve returns to stockholders while allowing flexibility for the Company to pursue very selective strategic growth opportunities that can provide compelling stockholder returns.\nOn July 31, 2017, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on August 23, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2017.\nOn October 25, 2017, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on November 10, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 3, 2017.\nOn February 13, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on March 2, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.\nOn April 24, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on May 11, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2018.\nOn July 24, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on August 10, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 3, 2018.\nOn October 23, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on November 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 2, 2018.\nOn February 19, 2019, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.6 million, which will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2019.\nMarch 2017 Special Distribution\nOn March 31, 2017, our board of managers declared a cash distribution payable to holders of our Class A Units, Class B Units and Class C Units as of March 27, 2017, resulting in distributions to such holders in the aggregate amount of $190.0 million. The March Special Distribution was funded with available cash on hand and was paid to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as disbursing agent, on March 31, 2017.\nNovember 2017 Special Dividend\nOn November 2, 2017, our board of directors declared the November Special Dividend of approximately $600.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million and was paid on November 22, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2017.\nApril 2018 Special Dividend\nOn April 3, 2018, our board of directors declared the April Special Dividend of approximately $350.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the offering of the New Notes due 2024, together with cash on hand of approximately $225.0 million, and was paid on April 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018.\nStock Repurchase\nWe repurchased 1.1 million shares, totaling approximately $25.9 million, of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2018, we repurchased 1.6 million shares, or 3% of outstanding shares, totaling approximately $38.0 million, under the Company's Stock Repurchase Program which authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $40.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock.\nDuring 2018, we returned approximately $400 million of capital to stockholders and have returned $1.2 billion since our IPO. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nABL Facility\nOn April 1, 2016, we entered into the ABL Facility with certain lenders and Citibank, N.A. (together with its affiliates, Citibank\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent, with an aggregate lender commitment of up to $50.0 million, at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability. On October 15, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries, as borrowers, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent (in such capacity, the \"Agent\"), which amended and restated in its entirety the existing ABL Facility and, among other things (i) increased the aggregate commitments available to be borrowed under the ABL Facility to $125.0 million, (ii) extended the maturity date of the ABL Facility to October 15, 2023; (iii) decreased the applicable interest rate margins with respect to the loans and the applicable fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit; and (iv) amended certain covenants and other terms and provisions.\nUnder the ABL Facility, up to $10.0 million of the commitments may be used to incur swingline loans from Citibank and up to $50.0 million of the commitments may be used to issue letters of credit. The ABL Facility will mature on October 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, no loans were outstanding under the ABL Facility and there were $4.6 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $120.4 million of availability under the ABL Facility (calculated net of $4.6 million of letters of credit outstanding at such time).\nRevolving loan (and letter of credit) availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is equal to the sum of certain eligible billed and unbilled accounts, certain eligible inventory, certain eligible supplies inventory and qualified cash, in each case, subject to specified advance rates. The borrowing base availability is subject to certain reserves, which may be established by the agent in its reasonable credit discretion. The reserves may include rent reserves, lower of cost or market reserve, port charges reserves and any other reserves that the agent determines in its reasonable credit judgment to the extent such reserves relate to conditions that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the value of the collateral included in the borrowing base.\nSubject to permitted exceptions, the obligations of the borrowers under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by (i) first-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes), which includes, among other things, certain accounts receivables, inventory and cash of ours and the guarantors, and (ii) second-priority security interests in the Notes Priority Collateral (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes), which includes, among other things, material mining properties, shares of capital stock of the guarantors, intellectual property, as extracted collateral (to the extent not constituting inventory), and certain fixed assets of ours and the guarantors.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is determined based on the average availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging currently from 150 bps to 200 bps. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a fee in\nrespect of unutilized commitments, which is based on the availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging from 25 bps to 37.5 bps. We are also required to pay a fee on amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility at a rate not in excess of 200 bps, and certain administrative fees.\nWe are able to voluntarily repay outstanding loans and reduce unused commitments, in each case, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize letters of credit anytime the outstanding loans and letters of credit exceed the maximum availability then in effect. We are also required to use net proceeds from certain significant asset sales to repay outstanding loans, but may re-borrow following such prepayments if the conditions to borrowings are met.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary covenants for asset-based credit agreements of this type, including among other things: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain liens; (iv) restrictions on making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to certain indebtedness. Additionally, the ABL Facility contains a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, which ratio is tested if availability under the ABL Facility is less than a certain amount. As of December 31, 2018, we were not subject to this covenant. Subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, the ABL Facility also contains customary events of default.\nWe were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2018.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn November 2, 2017, we consummated a private offering (the Offering\u201d) of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $340.0 million from the Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million, to pay a special cash dividend of approximately $600.0 million, or $11.21 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis (the \"November Special Dividend\").\nOn March 1, 2018, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the \"New Notes\") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (\"Regulation S\"). The New Notes were issued at 103.00% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest from November 2, 2017. The New Notes were issued as \"Additional Notes\" under the indenture dated as of November 2, 2017 (the \"Original Indenture\") among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\") and priority lien collateral trustee (the \"Priority Lien Collateral Trustee\"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2018 (the \"First Supplemental Indenture\" and, the Original Indenture as supplemented thereby, the \"Indenture\"). The New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the New Notes, together with cash on hand of $225.0 million, to pay a special dividend of approximately $350.0 million, or $6.53 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis on April 20, 2018 (the \"April Special Dividend\").\nThe Notes will mature on November 1, 2024 and interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2018.\nAt any time prior to November 1, 2020, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the indenture) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after November 1, 2020, at redemption prices specified in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the redemption date. At any time on or prior to November 1, 2020, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a redemption price of 108.00% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date. We are also required to make offers to purchase the Notes (i) at a purchase price of 101.00% of the principal amount thereof in the event we experience specific kinds of change of control triggering events, (ii) at a purchase price of 103.00% of the principal amount\nthereof prior to making certain restricted payments, and (iii) at a purchase price of 100.00% of the principal amount thereof in the event we make certain asset sales or dispositions and do not reinvest the net proceeds therefrom or use such net proceeds to repay certain indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the date of purchase.\nRestricted Payment Offer and Concurrent Tender Offer\nOn February 21, 2019, the Company announced the commencement of an offer to repurchase (the \"Restricted Payment Offer\") up to $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d) at a repurchase price of 103% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Restricted Payment Offer is being made in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes to provide the Company with the ability in the future to declare special dividends and/or repurchase shares of common stock of an estimated $150 million. The Company concurrently announced the launch of a tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase up to $150 million aggregate principal amount of its Notes, at a repurchase price of 104.25% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. This Annual Report is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the Notes in the Restricted Payment Offer or the Tender Offer.\nPromissory Note\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had debt outstanding of $0.8 million, all of which was classified as current, which represents a security agreement and promissory note assumed in the Asset Acquisition. The promissory note matures on March 31, 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 4.00% per annum. We are required to make periodic payments of principal and interest over the term of the promissory note. The promissory note is secured by the underground mining equipment it was used to purchase.\nVoluntary Employee Beneficiary Association\nIn connection with the Asset Acquisition, we entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a VEBA trust to be formed and administered by the UMWA. We paid $4.2 million and $20.8 million in installments during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Contributions to the VEBA are non-recurring in nature and were immediately expensed and included within cost of sales in the Statements of Operations.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2018, restricted cash included $0.8 million in other long-term assets in the Balance Sheet which represents amounts invested in certificate of deposits as financial assurance for post mining reclamation obligations.\nShort-Term Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased $17.5 million in United States Treasury bills with a maturity of six months. These Treasury bills were posted as collateral for the self-insured black lung related claims asserted by or on behalf of former employees of Walter Energy and its subsidiaries, which were assumed in the Asset Acquisition and relate to periods prior to March 31, 2016.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur mining operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance our operations and to comply with environmental regulations. Maintaining and expanding mines and related infrastructure is capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of met coal reserves, mining costs, the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require ongoing capital expenditures. While a significant amount of the capital expenditures required at our mines has been spent, we must continue to invest capital to maintain our production. In addition, any decisions to increase production at our mines or to develop the high-quality met coal recoverable reserves at our Blue Creek Energy Mine in the future could also affect our capital needs or cause future capital expenditures to be higher than in the past and/or higher than our estimates.\nTo fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or sell equity securities. Our ability to obtain bank financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings\nmay be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our current or future debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control.\nOur cash capital expenditures were $101.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the continuation of the capital investment program that we implemented in 2017 to upgrade all key production equipment to further improve efficiency and reliability of our mining operations. We spent approximately $69.0 million in sustaining capital which was in line with our guidance of $70.0 to $83.0 million, and an additional $33.0 million in other discretionary capital, which included the construction of a new portal at Mine No. 7 and which was within our guidance. The cash capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital accruals and leases of approximately $6.3 million.\nWe evaluate our spending on an ongoing basis in connection with our mining plans and the prices of met coal taking into consideration the funding available to maintain our operations at optimal production levels.\nWe expect to continue making significant capital expenditures in 2019 above our normal sustaining capital expenditures that we believe will further improve efficiency, reliability and production levels in 2019 and the future. Total capital spending will depend upon a number of factors, including business and economic conditions, the met coal pricing environment and our expected financial performance and our capital expenditures can be reduced if those conditions were to deteriorate in 2019 or beyond. Our capital spending is expected to range from $100.0 to $120.0 million for the full year 2019, consisting of sustaining capital expenditures of approximately $70.0 to $87.0 million and discretionary capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 to $33.0 million. Our sustaining capital expenditures include expenditures related to longwall operations, new ventilation, and bleeder shafts. Our discretionary capital expenditures include Mine 4 development, an additional set of new longwall shields, and other various operational improvements, which will increase efficiency, increase production and lower costs over time. Because of the long lead times on the discretionary capital spending, we expect to realize the benefits of those projects primarily in 2020 and beyond. These amounts set forth above do not include any potential spending associated with our Blue Creek Energy Mine should we decide to develop it for production in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2018.\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promissory note (principal and interest)(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Notes (principal and interest)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum throughput obligations(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty obligations(4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Black lung obligations(5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations(5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,523,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents a security agreement and promissory note assumed in the Asset Acquisition.

Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our mining operations totaling $44.4 million, and $2.1 million for miscellaneous purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the period presented. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from management's estimates.\nWe believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are based upon management's historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCoal Reserves\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors that are beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists or third-party consultants. A number of sources of information are used to determine accurate recoverable reserve estimates including:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>geological conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>previously completed geological and reserve studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assumptions governing future prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future operating costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Some of the factors and assumptions, which will change from time to time, that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include, among other factors:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>mining activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new engineering and geological data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>modification of mining plans or mining methods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production,\nrevenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances may be material. Variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures, as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had 222.1 million metric tons of proven and probable coal reserves.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates to reclaim surface lands and supporting infrastructure at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the United States as defined by each mining permit. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse piles and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, and sealing portals at underground mines. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of related cash flows, discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our asset retirement obligations also include estimates to reclaim gas wells in accordance with the Oil and Gas Board of Alabama. On at least an annual basis, we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes, the anticipated timing of mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience. As changes in estimates occur, the carrying amount of the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate. For sites where there is no asset, expense or income is recognized for changes in estimates. If our assumptions differ from actual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $61.8 million, including $2.8 million reported as current.\nBlack Lung\nWe also have significant liabilities for uninsured miners' black lung benefit liabilities that were assumed in connection with the Asset Acquisition. The recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates of incurred but not reported claims determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims, benefit increases and mortality rates.\nBlack lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used. A discount rate of 4.18% and 3.56% was used to calculate the present value of the obligation as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded black lung liabilities of $26.8 million, of which $1.6 million is classified in other current liabilities and the remainder of $25.2 million is shown as a long-term liability as a separate line item in the Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2018, a one-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the liability by $3.5 million, while a one-percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by $4.4 million.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Asset Acquisition, we have significant federal and state NOLs of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively as of December 31, 2018.\nWe believe the utilization of these NOLs, subject to certain limitations, will significantly reduce the amount of federal and state income taxes payable by us for the foreseeable future as compared to what we would have had to pay at the statutory rates without these NOL benefits. Under Section 382 of the Code, these NOLs could be subject to annual limitations, further limitations, or elimination, as described below, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the future. To the extent we have taxable income in the future and can utilize these NOL carryforwards, subject to certain limitations, to reduce taxable income, our cash taxes will be significantly reduced in those future years. Notwithstanding the above, even if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our NOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets.\u201d\nOn September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling, which favorably resolved certain questions about our ability to qualify for an exception to the annual limitations under Section 382 of the Code on the utilization of NOLs to reduce taxable income. Based on such private letter ruling, we believe that there is no limitation on the utilization of our NOLs to shield our income from federal taxation. The private letter ruling was issued based on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings provided to the IRS by us. If any of these facts,\nassumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete, the private letter ruling may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations.\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not\u201d that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other things, all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results, our cumulative three-year income or loss position and potential current and future tax planning strategies.\nWe recorded a full valuation allowance in 2016 due to our cumulative loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. At December 31, 2017, we had a $312.5 million valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets, which represented a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. For 2017, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $416.5 million; however, we remained in a three-year cumulative loss position, had limited operating results as a new Company and given the industry's recent history of significant losses concluded as of December 31, 2017 that another year of significant profitability was needed to support a release of valuation allowance.\nDuring 2018, we continued our trend of sustained profitability, recording a pre-tax profit of $471.0 million for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2018, after considering all relevant factors, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets, the significant relevant factors that we considered are: (1) our recent history of profitability; (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies; (3) estimates of future HCC prices; (4) we moved from a three-year cumulative loss position to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established the full valuation allowance; and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences. Based on this evaluation, at December 31, 2018, we released our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets resulting in the $225.8 million benefit in our provision for income taxes.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Our sources of cash have been coal and natural gas sales to customers, proceeds received from the Notes Offering and access to our ABL Facility. Historically, our primary uses of cash have been for funding the operations of our coal and natural gas production operations, our capital expenditures, our reclamation obligations, professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition, the Secondary Equity Offerings and our IPO. In addition, we used available cash on hand to repurchase shares of common stock, pay our quarterly dividend, pay the March Special Distribution, pay a portion of the November Special Dividend (as defined below), and pay a portion of the April Special Dividend, each of which reduces or reduced cash and cash equivalents.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>21,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>297,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>244,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>19,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>47,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>20,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and other costs\n</td> <td>13,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>345,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(47,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(1,711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(49,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor)\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the nine months ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>559,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(107,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(281,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(458,279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,240\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116,392\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncontinued ramp up of production throughout 2017.

The Asset Acquisition included Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, which management believes to be two of the highest quality and lowest cost met coal mines in the United States. Prior to the Asset Acquisition, the Company had no operations and nominal assets. We acquired the Predecessor for an aggregate cash consideration of $50.8 million and the release of claims associated with the 2011 Credit Agreement and Walter Energy's 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. In connection with the closing of the Asset Acquisition and in exchange for a portion of the outstanding first lien debt, Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders were entitled to receive, on a pro rata basis, a distribution of our Class A Units.

The initial quarterly dividend of $2.7 million was paid on June 13, 2017 to stockholders of record on May 30, 2017. The Capital Allocation Policy also states the following: In addition to the regular quarterly dividend and to the extent that the Company generates excess cash that is beyond the then current requirements of the business, our board of directors may consider returning all or a portion of such excess cash to stockholders through a special dividend or implementation of a stock repurchase program. Any future dividends or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to consideration of a number of factors, including business and market conditions, future financial performance and other strategic investment opportunities.

Additionally, the ABL Facility contains a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, which ratio is tested if availability under the ABL Facility is less than a certain amount. As of December 31, 2018, we were not subject to this covenant. Subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, the ABL Facility also contains customary events of default.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had debt outstanding of $0.8 million, all of which was classified as current, which represents a security agreement and promissory note assumed in the Asset Acquisition. The promissory note matures on March 31, 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 4.00% per annum. We are required to make periodic payments of principal and interest over the term of the promissory note. The promissory note is secured by the underground mining equipment it was used to purchase.\nWe recorded a full valuation allowance in 2016 due to our cumulative loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. At December 31, 2017, we had a $312.5 million valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets, which represented a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. For 2017, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $416.5 million; however, we remained in a three-year cumulative loss position, had limited operating results as a new Company and given the industry's recent history of significant losses concluded as of December 31, 2017 that another year of significant profitability was needed to support a release of valuation allowance.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,342,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,124,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>35,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>1,378,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,169,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>716,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>10,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and depletion\n</td> <td>97,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>36,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and other costs\n</td> <td>9,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>869,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>508,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(37,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax benefit\n</td> <td>470,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(225,814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransaction and other costs were $9.1 million, or 0.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the New Notes and the Secondary Equity Offerings (as defined in Notes 16 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements).

Our capital spending is expected to range from $100.0 to $120.0 million for the full year 2019, consisting of sustaining capital expenditures of approximately $70.0 to $87.0 million and discretionary capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 to $33.0 million. Our sustaining capital expenditures include expenditures related to longwall operations, new ventilation, and bleeder shafts. Our discretionary capital expenditures include Mine 4 development, an additional set of new longwall shields, and other various operational improvements, which will increase efficiency, increase production and lower costs over time.

Met coal, which is converted to coke, is a critical input in the steel production process. Met coal is both consumed domestically in the countries where it is produced and exported by several of the largest producing countries, such as China, Australia, the United States, Canada and Russia. Therefore, demand for our coal will be highly correlated to conditions in the global steelmaking industry. The steelmaking industry's demand for met coal is affected by a number of factors, including the cyclical nature of that industry's business, technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant reduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for met coal, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Similarly, if alternative ingredients are used in substitution for met coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for met coal would materially decrease, which could also materially adversely affect demand for our met coal.\nWe also have significant liabilities for uninsured miners' black lung benefit liabilities that were assumed in connection with the Asset Acquisition. The recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates of incurred but not reported claims determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims, benefit increases and mortality rates.\nRestricted Payment Offer and Concurrent Tender Offer\nStatements of Cash Flows\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $225.8 million or an effective tax rate of (47.9)% compared to an income tax benefit of $38.6 million or an effective tax rate of (9.27)% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n (5) Represents estimated costs for black lung and asset retirement obligations, which have been presented on an undiscounted basis. \nCoal Reserves\nincrease in expenditures due to the increase in production at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $559.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and was primarily attributed to net income of $696.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $97.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $2.5 million, accretion of asset retirement obligations of $4.6 million, offset partially by an increase in net working capital of $10.7 million, a change in asset retirement obligation due to a change in estimate of $24.6 million and the release of our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of $223.0 million.

Please see Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\n$26.0 million in capital for projects that had been deferred in prior years due to low met coal price environments and spent an\nOverview\nOther revenues were $21.1 million, and were comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. Cost of other revenues was $19.4 million, representing 6.5% of total revenues and 91.9% of other revenues.\n\nthat was completed in 2018. The cash capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital accruals and leases of\nNet cash used in investing activities was $30.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the cash used in connection with the Asset Acquisition and the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills posted as collateral for the self-insured black lung claims that were assumed in the Asset Acquisition of $17.5 million.\n (6) Represents a capital lease obligation for the purchase of underground mining equipment. \nWe evaluate our cash cost of sales on a cost per metric ton basis. Cash cost of sales is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to GAAP, are classified in the Statements of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Our cash cost of sales per metric ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the metric tons sold. Cash cost of sales is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nShort-Term Investments\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor) were as follows: \nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nWe evaluate our operations based on the volume of coal we can safely produce and sell in compliance with regulatory standards, and the prices we receive for our coal. Our sales volume and sales prices are largely dependent upon the terms of our coal sales contracts, for which prices generally are set on daily index averages or a quarterly basis. The volume of coal we sell is also a function of the pricing environment in the international met coal markets and the amounts of LV and MV coal that we sell. We evaluate the price we receive for our coal on two primary metrics: first, our gross price realization and second, our average net selling price per metric ton.\nUnder the ABL Facility, up to $10.0 million of the commitments may be used to incur swingline loans from Citibank and up to $50.0 million of the commitments may be used to issue letters of credit. The ABL Facility will mature on October 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, no loans were outstanding under the ABL Facility and there were $4.6 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $120.4 million of availability under the ABL Facility (calculated net of $4.6 million of letters of credit outstanding at such time).\nOperating Activities\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark price. The gross price realization for the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on a volume weighted average Australian HCC Benchmark price as the Australian HCC Benchmark price was only set quarterly.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). Cash flows from financing activities for the Predecessor period primarily represent net transfers to/from Walter Energy and net payments on debt. As cash and the financing of our Predecessor's operations have historically been managed by Walter Energy, the components of net transfers to/from Walter Energy include cash transfers from us to Walter Energy and the payments by Walter Energy to settle our obligations. These transactions are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded.\nOn July 31, 2017, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on August 23, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2017.\nOther postretirement benefits were $6.2 million, or 8.6% of total revenues, and represent postretirement healthcare benefits of the Predecessor.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we changed our gross price realization calculation to no longer be based on the quarterly Australian LV Index average due to this index being on a one-month lag basis and not closely correlating with the timing of our\nVoluntary Employee Beneficiary Association\nTo fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or sell equity securities. Our ability to obtain bank financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings\nThe historical costs and expenses reflected in the Predecessor combined results of operations include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Walter Energy. Substantially all of the Predecessor's senior management were employed by Walter Energy and certain functions critical to the Predecessor's operations were centralized and managed by Walter Energy. Historically, the centralized functions have included executive senior management, financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, accounting, shared services, information technology, tax, risk management, treasury, legal, human resources, and strategy and development. The costs of each of these services have been allocated to the Predecessor on the basis of the Predecessor's relative headcount, revenue and total assets to that of Walter Energy.\n (5) Represents cost and expenses in connection with workforce reductions at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 and corporate headquarters. (see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements) \n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and \n\nOn March 31, 2017, our board of managers declared a cash distribution payable to holders of our Class A Units, Class B Units and Class C Units as of March 27, 2017, resulting in distributions to such holders in the aggregate amount of $190.0 million. The March Special Distribution was funded with available cash on hand and was paid to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as disbursing agent, on March 31, 2017.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for other revenues, cost of other revenues, depreciation and depletion, selling, general and administrative, and certain transactions or adjustments that the CEO, our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn February 13, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on March 2, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $47.4 million, or 15.9% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and depletion of mineral interests.\nOn September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling, which favorably resolved certain questions about our ability to qualify for an exception to the annual limitations under Section 382 of the Code on the utilization of NOLs to reduce taxable income. Based on such private letter ruling, we believe that there is no limitation on the utilization of our NOLs to shield our income from federal taxation. The private letter ruling was issued based on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings provided to the IRS by us. If any of these facts,\nOn April 19, 2017, the Company completed its IPO, whereby certain selling stockholders sold 16,666,667 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the IPO. All of the net proceeds from the IPO were received by the selling stockholders. The aggregate net proceeds to the selling stockholders in the IPO were $296.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.8 million. The Company paid the offering expenses of $15.9 million on behalf of the selling stockholders. Following the closing of the IPO, 53,442,532 shares of common stock were outstanding. On April 13, 2017, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol HCC\u201d and on April 19, 2017, we closed our IPO.\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to new accounting pronouncements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and our continued strong financial performance which contributed to a cumulative three-year income position. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, we released all of our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The release of the valuation allowance primarily resulted in a net income tax benefit of $225.8 million that was recorded in income tax benefit (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in 2019, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective tax rate of 23%-25%. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2034. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n \u2022 the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; \nWe repurchased 1.1 million shares, totaling approximately $25.9 million, of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2018, we repurchased 1.6 million shares, or 3% of outstanding shares, totaling approximately $38.0 million, under the Company's Stock Repurchase Program which authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $40.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock.\nOur results on a Predecessor\u201d basis relate to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Warrior Met Coal, LLC from Walter Energy in the Asset Acquisition and the related periods ending on or prior to March 31, 2016. Our results on a Successor\u201d basis relate to Warrior Met Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries for periods beginning as of April 1, 2016 and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. after giving effect to our corporate conversion on April 12, 2017 from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation. Our results for the Predecessor and Successor periods have been separated by a vertical line to identify these different bases of accounting.\nPromissory Note\nApril 2018 Special Dividend\nOn April 12, 2017, in connection with the IPO, Warrior Met Coal, LLC filed a certificate of conversion, whereby Warrior Met Coal, LLC effected a corporate conversion from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Warrior Met Coal, Inc. As part of the corporate conversion, holders of Class A, Class B Units (which included the Class B Units which had converted into Class A Units) and Class C Units of Warrior Met Coal, LLC received shares of our common stock for each unit held immediately prior to the corporate conversion using an approximate 13.9459-to-one conversion ratio. In connection with this corporate conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation. Pursuant to the Company's certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 140,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. All references in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d to the number of shares and per share amounts of common stock have been retroactively recast to reflect the corporate conversion.\n \u2022 geological conditions; \nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nAt any time prior to November 1, 2020, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the indenture) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after November 1, 2020, at redemption prices specified in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the redemption date. At any time on or prior to November 1, 2020, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a redemption price of 108.00% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date. We are also required to make offers to purchase the Notes (i) at a purchase price of 101.00% of the principal amount thereof in the event we experience specific kinds of change of control triggering events, (ii) at a purchase price of 103.00% of the principal amount\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we also conducted the Rights Offerings. The Rights Offerings gave Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders and certain qualified unsecured creditors the option to purchase an aggregate 2,500,004 Class B Units for $80.00 per unit and irrevocably commit to purchase, on the same pro rata basis, Class A Units in one or more capital raising transactions at such later date and on such terms and subject to such conditions as determined by a supermajority vote of our board of managers. The $200.0 million raised from the Rights Offerings was used to pay cash consideration of $50.8 million for the Asset Acquisition, including repayment of certain debtor-in-possession credit agreements of Walter Energy, to sustain our coal mining operations following consummation of the Asset Acquisition and for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $49.7 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $47.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $2.8 million, offset by a net decrease in our working capital of $17.7 million. The decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by effects of the Asset Acquisition, an increase in trade accounts receivable offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of an increase in sales and an increase in operating costs associated with the reinitiation of Mine No. 4 operations in August 2016.\nOn July 24, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on August 10, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 3, 2018.\n (2) Represents principal and interest payments on our Notes. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOur mining operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance our operations and to comply with environmental regulations. Maintaining and expanding mines and related infrastructure is capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of met coal reserves, mining costs, the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require ongoing capital expenditures. While a significant amount of the capital expenditures required at our mines has been spent, we must continue to invest capital to maintain our production. In addition, any decisions to increase production at our mines or to develop the high-quality met coal recoverable reserves at our Blue Creek Energy Mine in the future could also affect our capital needs or cause future capital expenditures to be higher than in the past and/or higher than our estimates.\nWe believe the utilization of these NOLs, subject to certain limitations, will significantly reduce the amount of federal and state income taxes payable by us for the foreseeable future as compared to what we would have had to pay at the statutory rates without these NOL benefits. Under Section 382 of the Code, these NOLs could be subject to annual limitations, further limitations, or elimination, as described below, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the future. To the extent we have taxable income in the future and can utilize these NOL carryforwards, subject to certain limitations, to reduce taxable income, our cash taxes will be significantly reduced in those future years. Notwithstanding the above, even if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our NOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets.\u201d\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nCapital Expenditures\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $9.0 million, or 12.6% of total revenues, and were primarily comprised of employee salaries and benefits.\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in our accounts receivable was primarily driven by an increase in\n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to pay distributions; \nincrease in our working capital was primarily driven by an increase in trade accounts receivables, income tax receivables, other\nNovember 2017 Special Dividend\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide surety bonds and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our mining operations totaling $44.4 million, and $2.1 million for miscellaneous purposes.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nReorganization items, net, was $7.9 million, or 11.1% of total revenues, and was comprised of an allocation of corporate professional fees incurred by the Predecessor in relation to the Chapter 11 Cases of $11.0 million offset by rejected executory contracts and leases of $18.9 million.\nstock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.9 million and\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2016\nInterest expense, net of $1.7 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, is comprised of interest on our security agreement and promissory note, and amortization of our ABL Facility origination fees.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $192.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the proceeds received from the Rights Offerings offset by payments of debt issuance costs.\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates to reclaim surface lands and supporting infrastructure at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the United States as defined by each mining permit. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse piles and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, and sealing portals at underground mines. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of related cash flows, discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our asset retirement obligations also include estimates to reclaim gas wells in accordance with the Oil and Gas Board of Alabama. On at least an annual basis, we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes, the anticipated timing of mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience. As changes in estimates occur, the carrying amount of the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate. For sites where there is no asset, expense or income is recognized for changes in estimates. If our assumptions differ from actual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $61.8 million, including $2.8 million reported as current.\n2021 tax years, as a result of changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The increase in inventories was due to the\nRestructuring cost of $3.4 million, or 4.8% of total revenues, resulted from the Predecessor idling Mine No. 4 and workforce reductions at both Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 and corporate headquarters due to the continued decline in met coal prices.\nOn a quarterly basis, our blended gross selling price per metric ton may differ from the Platts Index price per metric ton, primarily due to our gross sales price per ton being based on a blended average of gross sales price on our LV and MV coals as compared to the Platts Index price and due to the fact that many of our met coal supply agreements are based on a variety of indices.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOn November 2, 2017, our board of directors declared the November Special Dividend of approximately $600.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million and was paid on November 22, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2017.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors that are beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists or third-party consultants. A number of sources of information are used to determine accurate recoverable reserve estimates including:\nDuring 2018, we returned approximately $400 million of capital to stockholders and have returned $1.2 billion since our IPO. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\n\n (4) Represents expenses and income directly associated with the Predecessor's Chapter 11 Cases (as defined in Note 1 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements). \nThe financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the period presented. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from management's estimates.\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Sales Volumes, Gross Price Realization and Average Net Selling Price\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) was $716.6 million, or 52.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $592.5 million, or 50.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $124.1 million increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by $100.9 million increase due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volumes coupled with a $24.2 million increase due to a $3.49 increase in the average cash cost of sales per metric ton primarily due to higher spending associated with the increased sales volume.\nTransaction and other costs associated with the Asset Acquisition and IPO were $13.6 million, or 4.6% of total revenues, of which $10.5 million was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition and $3.1 million was comprised of professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO.\nWe evaluate our spending on an ongoing basis in connection with our mining plans and the prices of met coal taking into consideration the funding available to maintain our operations at optimal production levels.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $29.0 million, or 40.6% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and mine development costs.\n (1) Represents idle costs incurred, such as electricity, insurance and maintenance labor. This mine was idled in early 2016 and restarted in August 2016. \naccretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.8 million, offset by a net increase in our working capital of $61.0 million. The\nSales were $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $218.0 million increase in revenues was primarily driven by a $191.8 million increase in revenue due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volume combined with a $26.2 million increase in revenue related to a $3.78 increase in the average selling price per metric ton of met coal.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor).\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below), was $244.72 million, or 82.2% of total revenues, and was primarily comprised of met coal sales of 2.4 million metric tons at an average cash cost of sales of $82.84 per metric ton. Our cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned roof instability issues at Mine No. 7, carrying costs of $8.7 million for the idled Mine No. 4, the $25.0 million VEBA contribution and an increase in royalty expense due to an increase in our realized sales price.\nSales were $276.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and were comprised of met coal sales of 2.4 million metric tons at an average selling price of $115.67 per metric ton. Substantially all of these sales came from Mine No. 7 as Mine No. 4 was idled in early 2016 and reinitiated operations in August of 2016. Also, we restarted a second longwall in Mine No. 7 in October 2016. Our sales were negatively impacted by roof instability issues experienced at Mine No. 7. Beginning in October 2016, we completed mining on the longwall panel where we experienced the roof instability issues and began production on a new longwall panel.\nIncome Taxes\nRestricted Cash\nWe were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2018.\n (4) We have obligations on various coal and land leases to prepay certain amounts, which are recoupable in future years when mining occurs. \nOn October 23, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on November 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 2, 2018.\nfurther improve efficiency and reliability of the mining operations. We spent approximately $62.0 million in sustaining capital,\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor) primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nCost of other revenues was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $18.3 million decrease is primarily due to a $21.5 million decrease in our asset retirement obligations attributable to the net impact of changes in current estimates of the costs and scope of remaining reclamation work, changes in discount rates and fluctuations in projected mine life estimates.\nof 2017. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily driven by an\n (1) Represents non-cash accretion expense and valuation adjustment associated with our asset retirement obligations (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). \nWe believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are based upon management's historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n (7) We entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a VEBA trust formed and administered by the UMWA.  Results of Operations\nOn January 14, 2019, the IRS issued a statement that AMT refunds for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to sequestration which reversed an earlier IRS announcement that refundable AMT credits would be subject to sequestration. As a result, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and recorded a measurement period adjustment recognizing an income tax receivable and related income tax benefit of $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, we have a current income tax receivable of $21.6 million and a non-current income tax receivable of $21.3 million which represents our total AMT credits expected to be received in 2019 to 2022.\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2018, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on gross sales, which excludes demurrage and other charges, as a percentage of the Platts Index price. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our realized price per ton based on gross sales as a percentage of the Australian LV Index.\nNet cash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for noncash items, such as depreciation and depletion of property, plant and equipment and mineral interests, deferred income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation, non-cash reorganization items, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, net, accretion of asset retirement obligations and changes in net working capital. The timing between the conversion of our billed and unbilled receivables into cash from our customers and disbursements to our vendors is the primary driver of changes in our working capital.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $458.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Platts Index, the Australian LV Index, or the Australian HCC Benchmark depending on the time period. The gross price realization for the year ended December 31, 2018 is based on a volume weighted-average Platts Index price, the year December 31, 2017 is based on a volume weighted average of the three-month average of the Platts Index, the Steel Index (\"TSI\") premium coking coal index and the Argus Index on a one month lag during each quarter (the \"Australian LV Index\"), and for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 is based on a volume weighted average Australian HCC Benchmark.\nOn March 31, 2016, we experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. As a result of such ownership change, absent an applicable exception to such rules, an annual limitation under Section 382 would apply for federal and certain state income tax purposes with respect to the utilization of NOLs. In 2017, we had requested a private letter ruling ( PLR\u201d) from the IRS to clarify certain matters, that if ruled favorably on by the IRS, would allow us to qualify for an exception to the aforementioned rules limiting its utilization of its NOLs. On September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a favorable PLR. Prior to the issuance of the PLR, we operated and prepared our financial statements based on an assumption that an annual limitation on the utilization of the NOLs existed. Based on the receipt of the favorable PLR, we now believe that we qualify for an exception to such NOL limitation rules and as such, no annual Code Section 382 limitation to the utilization of our federal NOLs applies. As a result of qualifying for such exception and due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, our federal and state NOLs were revised downward to approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations. See \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets\" for additional discussion of this risk.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark price.\nassumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete, the private letter ruling may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) Segment Adjusted EBITDA; (ii) sales\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we incurred transaction costs related to professional fees in the amount of $10.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, which is recorded in transaction and other costs on the Statement of Operations.\nAs discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, on September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling that favorably impacts our ability to utilize our NOLs for federal income tax purposes. Prior to the issuance of the private letter ruling, we applied an annual limitation on the utilization of NOLs pursuant to Section 382 of the Code and, accordingly, expected to pay a significantly higher amount of income taxes for 2017. Following the issuance of the private letter ruling, we believe that our NOLs will not be subject to the annual limit of Section 382 as previously applied during 2017. Also, as discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017. We expect that our future free cash flow will meaningfully benefit from the favorable private letter ruling and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to (i) the unlimited use of our $1.1 billion NOLs and (ii) the refunding of AMT credits of approximately $42.9 million, which we expect to receive in 2019 through 2022.\n \u2022 acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings; and \nThe results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the Predecessor and Successor periods reflect different bases of accounting due to the impact of the Asset Acquisition on the financial statements. To aid the reader in understanding the results of operations of each of these distinctive periods, we have provided the following discussion of our historical results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). Due to these periods not being comparable, each period is discussed below on a standalone basis.\n \u2022 future operating costs.  Some of the factors and assumptions, which will change from time to time, that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include, among other factors:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and \nBlack lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used. A discount rate of 4.18% and 3.56% was used to calculate the present value of the obligation as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded black lung liabilities of $26.8 million, of which $1.6 million is classified in other current liabilities and the remainder of $25.2 million is shown as a long-term liability as a separate line item in the Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2018, a one-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the liability by $3.5 million, while a one-percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by $4.4 million.\nAs a result of the Asset Acquisition, we have significant federal and state NOLs of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively as of December 31, 2018.\na result of a significant capital investment program that we implemented in 2017 to upgrade all key production equipment to\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments excludes some, but not all, items that affect net loss and our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that presented by other companies.\nInterest expense of $16.6 million, or 23.2% of total revenues, represents interest on liabilities subject to compromise, which were attributed to the Predecessor.\nWe are a large scale, low cost U.S.-based producer and exporter of premium met coal operating two highly productive underground mines in Alabama. As of December 31, 2018, Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, our two operating mines, had approximately 108.3 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and our undeveloped Blue Creek Energy Mine contained 103.0 million metric tons of recoverable reserves. As a result of our high quality coal, our realized price has historically been in line with, or at a slight discount to, the Platts Index. Our HCC, mined from the Southern Appalachian portion of the Blue Creek coal seam, is characterized by low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, and LV to MV. These qualities make our coal ideally suited as a coking coal for the manufacture of steel.\n (2) Represents non-cash stock compensation expense associated with equity awards. \n (2) We entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association ( VEBA\u201d) trust formed and administered by the UMWA.  Adjusted EBITDA\nStock Repurchase\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nOn April 3, 2018, our board of directors declared the April Special Dividend of approximately $350.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the offering of the New Notes due 2024, together with cash on hand of approximately $225.0 million, and was paid on April 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018.\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight into our operating performance, and reflects how management analyzes our operating performance and compares that performance against other companies on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that cash costs of sales presents a useful measure of our controllable costs and our operational results by including all costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Period-to-period comparisons of cash cost of sales are intended to help management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our Company that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of cost of sales. Cash cost of sales should not be considered an alternative to cost of sales or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Cash cost of sales excludes some, but not all, items that affect cost of sales, and our presentation may vary from the presentations of other companies. As a result, cash cost of sales as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nshipments. Our gross price realization now represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on the blended gross sales of our LV and MV coal, excluding demurrage and quality specification adjustments, as a percentage of the Platts Index daily price. Our gross price realizations reflect the premiums and discounts we achieve on our LV and MV coal versus the Platts Index price because of the high quality premium products we sell into the export markets. In addition, the premiums and discounts in a quarter or year can be impacted by a rising or falling price environment.\n (6) Represents idle costs incurred, such as electricity, insurance and maintenance labor. This mine was idled in early 2016 and restarted in August 2016. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; \nRights Offerings\nCash Cost of Sales\nNet cash used in operating activities was $40.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor), and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $61.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $29.0 million, non-cash reorganization items of $18.9 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $10.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.2 million, offset partially by a net decrease in our working capital of $1.6 million. The net decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by higher disbursements for accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the period associated with our purchases from vendors, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable.\nThe Notes will mature on November 1, 2024 and interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2018.\nInvesting Activities\napproximately $15.0 million.\n \u2022 modification of mining plans or mining methods.  Each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production,\n\nGoing forward, we will need cash to fund debt service payments on our Notes and our other indebtedness and to fund operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. Our ability to fund our capital needs going forward will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, and, in the case of any future strategic investments, capital expenditures or special dividends financed partially or wholly with debt financing, our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital. We believe that our future cash flow from operations, together with cash on our balance sheet and borrowing availability under our ABL Facility, will provide adequate resources to fund our debt service payments and planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; \nOn March 1, 2018, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the \"New Notes\") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (\"Regulation S\"). The New Notes were issued at 103.00% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest from November 2, 2017. The New Notes were issued as \"Additional Notes\" under the indenture dated as of November 2, 2017 (the \"Original Indenture\") among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\") and priority lien collateral trustee (the \"Priority Lien Collateral Trustee\"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2018 (the \"First Supplemental Indenture\" and, the Original Indenture as supplemented thereby, the \"Indenture\"). The New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the New Notes, together with cash on hand of $225.0 million, to pay a special dividend of approximately $350.0 million, or $6.53 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis on April 20, 2018 (the \"April Special Dividend\").\nincome tax receivable was due to refundable AMT credits which will be received in 2019 through 2022 for the 2018 through\nThe combined financial statements of our Predecessor included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other historical Predecessor combined financial information presented and discussed in this management's discussion and analysis may not be indicative of what our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would actually have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nDuring 2018, we continued our trend of sustained profitability, recording a pre-tax profit of $471.0 million for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2018, after considering all relevant factors, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets, the significant relevant factors that we considered are: (1) our recent history of profitability; (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies; (3) estimates of future HCC prices; (4) we moved from a three-year cumulative loss position to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established the full valuation allowance; and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences. Based on this evaluation, at December 31, 2018, we released our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets resulting in the $225.8 million benefit in our provision for income taxes.\nInterest expense, net was $37.3 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $30.4 million increase was primarily driven by $36.3 million of additional interest expense on the Notes due to the issuance of $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount on March 1, 2018 and the issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount on November 2, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $36.6 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $36.5 million, or 3.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million increase is driven primarily by an increase in employee bonuses based on our performance through the year end December 31, 2018.\nCash balances were $205.6 million, $35.5 million and $150.0 million at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nthe average selling price per metric ton of our coal coupled with an increase in metric tons sold. The increase in our long-term\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cash cost of sales to total cost of sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\n\nSales were $65.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and were comprised of met coal sales of 0.8 million metric tons at an average selling price of $83.85 per metric ton.\nIf our cash flows from operations are less than we require, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe we can currently finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, (iii) the current state of the global economy and (iv) restrictions in our ABL Facility, the indenture governing the Notes and any other existing or future debt agreements. There can be no assurance that we will have or continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOn November 2, 2017, we consummated a private offering (the Offering\u201d) of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $340.0 million from the Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million, to pay a special cash dividend of approximately $600.0 million, or $11.21 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis (the \"November Special Dividend\").\nmillion in the aggregate, payment of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million, retirements of debt of $3.1 million, offset partially by\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2018.\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not\u201d that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other things, all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results, our cumulative three-year income or loss position and potential current and future tax planning strategies.\nOther revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.3 million compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other revenues are comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. The $9.1 million decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a realized loss of $1.8 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2018 combined with a realized gain of $5.4 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAsset Acquisition\n \u2022 assumptions governing future prices; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, restricted cash included $0.8 million in other long-term assets in the Balance Sheet which represents amounts invested in certificate of deposits as financial assurance for post mining reclamation obligations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily comprised of $101.6 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment and $8.9 million of capitalized mine development costs associated with our Mine 4 development. We spent approximately $69.0 million in sustaining capital and spent an additional $33.0 million in other discretionary capital, which included the construction of a new portal at Mine No. 7. The cash capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital accruals and leases of approximately $6.3 million.\nSenior Secured Notes\n", "item_7_text": "Our sources of cash have been coal and natural gas sales to customers, proceeds received from the Notes Offering and access to our ABL Facility. Historically, our primary uses of cash have been for funding the operations of our coal and natural gas production operations, our capital expenditures, our reclamation obligations, professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition, the Secondary Equity Offerings and our IPO. In addition, we used available cash on hand to repurchase shares of common stock, pay our quarterly dividend, pay the March Special Distribution, pay a portion of the November Special Dividend (as defined below), and pay a portion of the April Special Dividend, each of which reduces or reduced cash and cash equivalents.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor)\ncontinued ramp up of production throughout 2017. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to an increase in\nOn March 31, 2016, we consummated the acquisition of the Predecessor on a debt free basis with minimum legacy liabilities. The Asset Acquisition included Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, which management believes to be two of the highest quality and lowest cost met coal mines in the United States. Prior to the Asset Acquisition, the Company had no operations and nominal assets. We acquired the Predecessor for an aggregate cash consideration of $50.8 million and the release of claims associated with the 2011 Credit Agreement and Walter Energy's 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. In connection with the closing of the Asset Acquisition and in exchange for a portion of the outstanding first lien debt, Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders were entitled to receive, on a pro rata basis, a distribution of our Class A Units. We accounted for the Asset Acquisition as a business combination under Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the payment of dividends totaling $360.6 million in the aggregate, common shares repurchased of $38.0 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $3.7 million, retirements of debt of $3.1 million, offset partially by the net proceeds received from the issuance of the New Notes of $128.8 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nOn May 17, 2017, our board of directors adopted the Capital Allocation Policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. The initial quarterly dividend of $2.7 million was paid on June 13, 2017 to stockholders of record on May 30, 2017. The Capital Allocation Policy also states the following: In addition to the regular quarterly dividend and to the extent that the Company generates excess cash that is beyond the then current requirements of the business, our board of directors may consider returning all or a portion of such excess cash to stockholders through a special dividend or implementation of a stock repurchase program. Any future dividends or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to consideration of a number of factors, including business and market conditions, future financial performance and other strategic investment opportunities. The Company will also seek to optimize its capital structure to improve returns to stockholders while allowing flexibility for the Company to pursue very selective strategic growth opportunities that can provide compelling stockholder returns.\nIn connection with the Asset Acquisition, we entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a VEBA trust to be formed and administered by the UMWA. We paid $4.2 million and $20.8 million in installments during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Contributions to the VEBA are non-recurring in nature and were immediately expensed and included within cost of sales in the Statements of Operations.\nOther revenues were $6.2 million, and were comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. Cost of other revenues was $4.7 million, representing 6.6% of total revenues and 75.4% of other revenues.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million, or 6.9% of total revenues, reflecting the benefits of a restructured business without the legacy costs and liabilities which were not assumed in the Asset Acquisition.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary covenants for asset-based credit agreements of this type, including among other things: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain liens; (iv) restrictions on making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to certain indebtedness. Additionally, the ABL Facility contains a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, which ratio is tested if availability under the ABL Facility is less than a certain amount. As of December 31, 2018, we were not subject to this covenant. Subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, the ABL Facility also contains customary events of default.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had debt outstanding of $0.8 million, all of which was classified as current, which represents a security agreement and promissory note assumed in the Asset Acquisition. The promissory note matures on March 31, 2019 and bears a fixed interest rate of 4.00% per annum. We are required to make periodic payments of principal and interest over the term of the promissory note. The promissory note is secured by the underground mining equipment it was used to purchase.\nWe recorded a full valuation allowance in 2016 due to our cumulative loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. At December 31, 2017, we had a $312.5 million valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets, which represented a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. For 2017, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $416.5 million; however, we remained in a three-year cumulative loss position, had limited operating results as a new Company and given the industry's recent history of significant losses concluded as of December 31, 2017 that another year of significant profitability was needed to support a release of valuation allowance.\nTransaction and other costs were $9.1 million, or 0.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the New Notes and the Secondary Equity Offerings (as defined in Notes 16 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements). Transaction and other costs were $12.9 million, or 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 which was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and with the issuance of the Existing Notes (as defined in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nrespect of unutilized commitments, which is based on the availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging from 25 bps to 37.5 bps. We are also required to pay a fee on amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility at a rate not in excess of 200 bps, and certain administrative fees.\n \u2022 previously completed geological and reserve studies; \nWe expect to continue making significant capital expenditures in 2019 above our normal sustaining capital expenditures that we believe will further improve efficiency, reliability and production levels in 2019 and the future. Total capital spending will depend upon a number of factors, including business and economic conditions, the met coal pricing environment and our expected financial performance and our capital expenditures can be reduced if those conditions were to deteriorate in 2019 or beyond. Our capital spending is expected to range from $100.0 to $120.0 million for the full year 2019, consisting of sustaining capital expenditures of approximately $70.0 to $87.0 million and discretionary capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 to $33.0 million. Our sustaining capital expenditures include expenditures related to longwall operations, new ventilation, and bleeder shafts. Our discretionary capital expenditures include Mine 4 development, an additional set of new longwall shields, and other various operational improvements, which will increase efficiency, increase production and lower costs over time. Because of the long lead times on the discretionary capital spending, we expect to realize the benefits of those projects primarily in 2020 and beyond. These amounts set forth above do not include any potential spending associated with our Blue Creek Energy Mine should we decide to develop it for production in the future.\nBasis of Presentation\nOn February 21, 2019, the Company announced the commencement of an offer to repurchase (the \"Restricted Payment Offer\") up to $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d) at a repurchase price of 103% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Restricted Payment Offer is being made in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes to provide the Company with the ability in the future to declare special dividends and/or repurchase shares of common stock of an estimated $150 million. The Company concurrently announced the launch of a tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) to repurchase up to $150 million aggregate principal amount of its Notes, at a repurchase price of 104.25% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. This Annual Report is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the Notes in the Restricted Payment Offer or the Tender Offer.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and depletion, net reorganization items, restructuring costs, transaction and other costs, Mine No. 4 idle costs, VEBA contributions, non-cash stock compensation expense and non-cash asset retirement obligation accretion. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Financial Statements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased $17.5 million in United States Treasury bills with a maturity of six months. These Treasury bills were posted as collateral for the self-insured black lung related claims asserted by or on behalf of former employees of Walter Energy and its subsidiaries, which were assumed in the Asset Acquisition and relate to periods prior to March 31, 2016.\n \u2022 new engineering and geological data; \nWe sell substantially all of our met coal production to steel producers. Met coal, which is converted to coke, is a critical input in the steel production process. Met coal is both consumed domestically in the countries where it is produced and exported by several of the largest producing countries, such as China, Australia, the United States, Canada and Russia. Therefore, demand for our coal will be highly correlated to conditions in the global steelmaking industry. The steelmaking industry's demand for met coal is affected by a number of factors, including the cyclical nature of that industry's business, technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant reduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for met coal, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Similarly, if alternative ingredients are used in substitution for met coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for met coal would materially decrease, which could also materially adversely affect demand for our met coal.\nWe also have significant liabilities for uninsured miners' black lung benefit liabilities that were assumed in connection with the Asset Acquisition.

Cash cost of sales is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to GAAP, are classified in the Statements of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Our cash cost of sales per metric ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the metric tons sold. Cash cost of sales is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nShort-Term Investments\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor) were as follows: \nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nWe evaluate our operations based on the volume of coal we can safely produce and sell in compliance with regulatory standards, and the prices we receive for our coal. Our sales volume and sales prices are largely dependent upon the terms of our coal sales contracts, for which prices generally are set on daily index averages or a quarterly basis. The volume of coal we sell is also a function of the pricing environment in the international met coal markets and the amounts of LV and MV coal that we sell. We evaluate the price we receive for our coal on two primary metrics: first, our gross price realization and second, our average net selling price per metric ton.\nUnder the ABL Facility, up to $10.0 million of the commitments may be used to incur swingline loans from Citibank and up to $50.0 million of the commitments may be used to issue letters of credit. The ABL Facility will mature on October 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, no loans were outstanding under the ABL Facility and there were $4.6 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $120.4 million of availability under the ABL Facility (calculated net of $4.6 million of letters of credit outstanding at such time).\nOperating Activities\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark price. The gross price realization for the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on a volume weighted average Australian HCC Benchmark price as the Australian HCC Benchmark price was only set quarterly.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). Cash flows from financing activities for the Predecessor period primarily represent net transfers to/from Walter Energy and net payments on debt. As cash and the financing of our Predecessor's operations have historically been managed by Walter Energy, the components of net transfers to/from Walter Energy include cash transfers from us to Walter Energy and the payments by Walter Energy to settle our obligations. These transactions are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded.\nOn July 31, 2017, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on August 23, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2017.\nOther postretirement benefits were $6.2 million, or 8.6% of total revenues, and represent postretirement healthcare benefits of the Predecessor.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we changed our gross price realization calculation to no longer be based on the quarterly Australian LV Index average due to this index being on a one-month lag basis and not closely correlating with the timing of our\nVoluntary Employee Beneficiary Association\nTo fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or sell equity securities.

Substantially all of the Predecessor's senior management were employed by Walter Energy and certain functions critical to the Predecessor's operations were centralized and managed by Walter Energy. Historically, the centralized functions have included executive senior management, financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, accounting, shared services, information technology, tax, risk management, treasury, legal, human resources, and strategy and development. The costs of each of these services have been allocated to the Predecessor on the basis of the Predecessor's relative headcount, revenue and total assets to that of Walter Energy.\n (5) Represents cost and expenses in connection with workforce reductions at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 and corporate headquarters.

The March Special Distribution was funded with available cash on hand and was paid to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as disbursing agent, on March 31, 2017.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for other revenues, cost of other revenues, depreciation and depletion, selling, general and administrative, and certain transactions or adjustments that the CEO, our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn February 13, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling $2.7 million, which was paid on March 2, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $47.4 million, or 15.9% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and depletion of mineral interests.\nOn September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling, which favorably resolved certain questions about our ability to qualify for an exception to the annual limitations under Section 382 of the Code on the utilization of NOLs to reduce taxable income. Based on such private letter ruling, we believe that there is no limitation on the utilization of our NOLs to shield our income from federal taxation. The private letter ruling was issued based on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings provided to the IRS by us. If any of these facts,\nOn April 19, 2017, the Company completed its IPO, whereby certain selling stockholders sold 16,666,667 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the IPO. All of the net proceeds from the IPO were received by the selling stockholders. The aggregate net proceeds to the selling stockholders in the IPO were $296.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.8 million. The Company paid the offering expenses of $15.9 million on behalf of the selling stockholders. Following the closing of the IPO, 53,442,532 shares of common stock were outstanding. On April 13, 2017, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol HCC\u201d and on April 19, 2017, we closed our IPO.\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to new accounting pronouncements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and our continued strong financial performance which contributed to a cumulative three-year income position. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, we released all of our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The release of the valuation allowance primarily resulted in a net income tax benefit of $225.8 million that was recorded in income tax benefit (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in 2019, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective tax rate of 23%-25%. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2034.

Our results for the Predecessor and Successor periods have been separated by a vertical line to identify these different bases of accounting.\nPromissory Note\nApril 2018 Special Dividend\nOn April 12, 2017, in connection with the IPO, Warrior Met Coal, LLC filed a certificate of conversion, whereby Warrior Met Coal, LLC effected a corporate conversion from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Warrior Met Coal, Inc. As part of the corporate conversion, holders of Class A, Class B Units (which included the Class B Units which had converted into Class A Units) and Class C Units of Warrior Met Coal, LLC received shares of our common stock for each unit held immediately prior to the corporate conversion using an approximate 13.9459-to-one conversion ratio. In connection with this corporate conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation. Pursuant to the Company's certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 140,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.

The Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after November 1, 2020, at redemption prices specified in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the redemption date. At any time on or prior to November 1, 2020, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a redemption price of 108.00% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date. We are also required to make offers to purchase the Notes (i) at a purchase price of 101.00% of the principal amount thereof in the event we experience specific kinds of change of control triggering events, (ii) at a purchase price of 103.00% of the principal amount\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we also conducted the Rights Offerings. The Rights Offerings gave Walter Energy's First Lien Lenders and certain qualified unsecured creditors the option to purchase an aggregate 2,500,004 Class B Units for $80.00 per unit and irrevocably commit to purchase, on the same pro rata basis, Class A Units in one or more capital raising transactions at such later date and on such terms and subject to such conditions as determined by a supermajority vote of our board of managers. The $200.0 million raised from the Rights Offerings was used to pay cash consideration of $50.8 million for the Asset Acquisition, including repayment of certain debtor-in-possession credit agreements of Walter Energy, to sustain our coal mining operations following consummation of the Asset Acquisition and for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $49.7 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $47.4 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $2.8 million, offset by a net decrease in our working capital of $17.7 million. The decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by effects of the Asset Acquisition, an increase in trade accounts receivable offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of an increase in sales and an increase in operating costs associated with the reinitiation of Mine No. 4 operations in August 2016.\nOn July 24, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on August 10, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 3, 2018.\n (2) Represents principal and interest payments on our Notes. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOur mining operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance our operations and to comply with environmental regulations. Maintaining and expanding mines and related infrastructure is capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of met coal reserves, mining costs, the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require ongoing capital expenditures. While a significant amount of the capital expenditures required at our mines has been spent, we must continue to invest capital to maintain our production. In addition, any decisions to increase production at our mines or to develop the high-quality met coal recoverable reserves at our Blue Creek Energy Mine in the future could also affect our capital needs or cause future capital expenditures to be higher than in the past and/or higher than our estimates.\nWe believe the utilization of these NOLs, subject to certain limitations, will significantly reduce the amount of federal and state income taxes payable by us for the foreseeable future as compared to what we would have had to pay at the statutory rates without these NOL benefits. Under Section 382 of the Code, these NOLs could be subject to annual limitations, further limitations, or elimination, as described below, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the future. To the extent we have taxable income in the future and can utilize these NOL carryforwards, subject to certain limitations, to reduce taxable income, our cash taxes will be significantly reduced in those future years. Notwithstanding the above, even if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our NOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets.\u201d\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nCapital Expenditures\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $9.0 million, or 12.6% of total revenues, and were primarily comprised of employee salaries and benefits.\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities.

Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our mining operations totaling $44.4 million, and $2.1 million for miscellaneous purposes.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nReorganization items, net, was $7.9 million, or 11.1% of total revenues, and was comprised of an allocation of corporate professional fees incurred by the Predecessor in relation to the Chapter 11 Cases of $11.0 million offset by rejected executory contracts and leases of $18.9 million.\nstock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $1.9 million and\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2016\nInterest expense, net of $1.7 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, is comprised of interest on our security agreement and promissory note, and amortization of our ABL Facility origination fees.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $192.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the proceeds received from the Rights Offerings offset by payments of debt issuance costs.\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates to reclaim surface lands and supporting infrastructure at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the United States as defined by each mining permit. Significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse piles and slurry ponds, reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines, and sealing portals at underground mines. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of related cash flows, discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our asset retirement obligations also include estimates to reclaim gas wells in accordance with the Oil and Gas Board of Alabama. On at least an annual basis, we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes, the anticipated timing of mine closures, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience. As changes in estimates occur, the carrying amount of the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate. For sites where there is no asset, expense or income is recognized for changes in estimates. If our assumptions differ from actual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. At December 31, 2018, we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of $61.8 million, including $2.8 million reported as current.\n2021 tax years, as a result of changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The increase in inventories was due to the\nRestructuring cost of $3.4 million, or 4.8% of total revenues, resulted from the Predecessor idling Mine No. 4 and workforce reductions at both Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 and corporate headquarters due to the continued decline in met coal prices.\nOn a quarterly basis, our blended gross selling price per metric ton may differ from the Platts Index price per metric ton, primarily due to our gross sales price per ton being based on a blended average of gross sales price on our LV and MV coals as compared to the Platts Index price and due to the fact that many of our met coal supply agreements are based on a variety of indices.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOn November 2, 2017, our board of directors declared the November Special Dividend of approximately $600.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million and was paid on November 22, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2017.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors that are beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists or third-party consultants. A number of sources of information are used to determine accurate recoverable reserve estimates including:\nDuring 2018, we returned approximately $400 million of capital to stockholders and have returned $1.2 billion since our IPO. We remain committed to returning cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\n\n (4) Represents expenses and income directly associated with the Predecessor's Chapter 11 Cases (as defined in Note 1 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements). \nThe financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the period presented. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from management's estimates.\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Sales Volumes, Gross Price Realization and Average Net Selling Price\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) was $716.6 million, or 52.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $592.5 million, or 50.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $124.1 million increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by $100.9 million increase due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volumes coupled with a $24.2 million increase due to a $3.49 increase in the average cash cost of sales per metric ton primarily due to higher spending associated with the increased sales volume.\nTransaction and other costs associated with the Asset Acquisition and IPO were $13.6 million, or 4.6% of total revenues, of which $10.5 million was comprised primarily of professional fees incurred in connection with the Asset Acquisition and $3.1 million was comprised of professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO.\nWe evaluate our spending on an ongoing basis in connection with our mining plans and the prices of met coal taking into consideration the funding available to maintain our operations at optimal production levels.\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $29.0 million, or 40.6% of total revenues, and was primarily related to depreciation of machinery and equipment and mine development costs.\n (1) Represents idle costs incurred, such as electricity, insurance and maintenance labor. This mine was idled in early 2016 and restarted in August 2016. \naccretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.8 million, offset by a net increase in our working capital of $61.0 million. The\nSales were $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $218.0 million increase in revenues was primarily driven by a $191.8 million increase in revenue due to a 1.0 million metric ton increase in met coal sales volume combined with a $26.2 million increase in revenue related to a $3.78 increase in the average selling price per metric ton of met coal.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor).\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below), was $244.72 million, or 82.2% of total revenues, and was primarily comprised of met coal sales of 2.4 million metric tons at an average cash cost of sales of $82.84 per metric ton. Our cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned roof instability issues at Mine No. 7, carrying costs of $8.7 million for the idled Mine No. 4, the $25.0 million VEBA contribution and an increase in royalty expense due to an increase in our realized sales price.\nSales were $276.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and were comprised of met coal sales of 2.4 million metric tons at an average selling price of $115.67 per metric ton. Substantially all of these sales came from Mine No. 7 as Mine No. 4 was idled in early 2016 and reinitiated operations in August of 2016. Also, we restarted a second longwall in Mine No. 7 in October 2016. Our sales were negatively impacted by roof instability issues experienced at Mine No. 7. Beginning in October 2016, we completed mining on the longwall panel where we experienced the roof instability issues and began production on a new longwall panel.\nIncome Taxes\nRestricted Cash\nWe were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2018.\n (4) We have obligations on various coal and land leases to prepay certain amounts, which are recoupable in future years when mining occurs. \nOn October 23, 2018, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which was paid on November 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 2, 2018.\nfurther improve efficiency and reliability of the mining operations. We spent approximately $62.0 million in sustaining capital,\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor) primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nCost of other revenues was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $18.3 million decrease is primarily due to a $21.5 million decrease in our asset retirement obligations attributable to the net impact of changes in current estimates of the costs and scope of remaining reclamation work, changes in discount rates and fluctuations in projected mine life estimates.\nof 2017. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily driven by an\n (1) Represents non-cash accretion expense and valuation adjustment associated with our asset retirement obligations (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). \nWe believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are based upon management's historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n (7) We entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a VEBA trust formed and administered by the UMWA.  Results of Operations\nOn January 14, 2019, the IRS issued a statement that AMT refunds for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to sequestration which reversed an earlier IRS announcement that refundable AMT credits would be subject to sequestration. As a result, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and recorded a measurement period adjustment recognizing an income tax receivable and related income tax benefit of $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, we have a current income tax receivable of $21.6 million and a non-current income tax receivable of $21.3 million which represents our total AMT credits expected to be received in 2019 to 2022.\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2018, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on gross sales, which excludes demurrage and other charges, as a percentage of the Platts Index price. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our realized price per ton based on gross sales as a percentage of the Australian LV Index.\nNet cash flows from operating activities consist of net income (loss) adjusted for noncash items, such as depreciation and depletion of property, plant and equipment and mineral interests, deferred income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation, non-cash reorganization items, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, net, accretion of asset retirement obligations and changes in net working capital. The timing between the conversion of our billed and unbilled receivables into cash from our customers and disbursements to our vendors is the primary driver of changes in our working capital.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $458.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Platts Index, the Australian LV Index, or the Australian HCC Benchmark depending on the time period. The gross price realization for the year ended December 31, 2018 is based on a volume weighted-average Platts Index price, the year December 31, 2017 is based on a volume weighted average of the three-month average of the Platts Index, the Steel Index (\"TSI\") premium coking coal index and the Argus Index on a one month lag during each quarter (the \"Australian LV Index\"), and for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 is based on a volume weighted average Australian HCC Benchmark.\nOn March 31, 2016, we experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. As a result of such ownership change, absent an applicable exception to such rules, an annual limitation under Section 382 would apply for federal and certain state income tax purposes with respect to the utilization of NOLs. In 2017, we had requested a private letter ruling ( PLR\u201d) from the IRS to clarify certain matters, that if ruled favorably on by the IRS, would allow us to qualify for an exception to the aforementioned rules limiting its utilization of its NOLs. On September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a favorable PLR. Prior to the issuance of the PLR, we operated and prepared our financial statements based on an assumption that an annual limitation on the utilization of the NOLs existed. Based on the receipt of the favorable PLR, we now believe that we qualify for an exception to such NOL limitation rules and as such, no annual Code Section 382 limitation to the utilization of our federal NOLs applies. As a result of qualifying for such exception and due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, our federal and state NOLs were revised downward to approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations. See \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit or eliminate our ability to utilize our significant tax NOLs or maintain our deferred tax assets\" for additional discussion of this risk.\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our audited financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\n(1) Gross price realization represents gross sales, excluding demurrage and other charges, divided by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark price.\nassumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete, the private letter ruling may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. If we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax attributes could be subject to severe limitations.\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) Segment Adjusted EBITDA; (ii) sales\nAs part of the Asset Acquisition, we incurred transaction costs related to professional fees in the amount of $10.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, which is recorded in transaction and other costs on the Statement of Operations.\nAs discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, on September 18, 2017, the IRS issued to us a private letter ruling that favorably impacts our ability to utilize our NOLs for federal income tax purposes. Prior to the issuance of the private letter ruling, we applied an annual limitation on the utilization of NOLs pursuant to Section 382 of the Code and, accordingly, expected to pay a significantly higher amount of income taxes for 2017. Following the issuance of the private letter ruling, we believe that our NOLs will not be subject to the annual limit of Section 382 as previously applied during 2017. Also, as discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017. We expect that our future free cash flow will meaningfully benefit from the favorable private letter ruling and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to (i) the unlimited use of our $1.1 billion NOLs and (ii) the refunding of AMT credits of approximately $42.9 million, which we expect to receive in 2019 through 2022.\n \u2022 acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings; and \nThe results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the Predecessor and Successor periods reflect different bases of accounting due to the impact of the Asset Acquisition on the financial statements. To aid the reader in understanding the results of operations of each of these distinctive periods, we have provided the following discussion of our historical results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor). Due to these periods not being comparable, each period is discussed below on a standalone basis.\n \u2022 future operating costs.  Some of the factors and assumptions, which will change from time to time, that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include, among other factors:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and \nBlack lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used. A discount rate of 4.18% and 3.56% was used to calculate the present value of the obligation as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded black lung liabilities of $26.8 million, of which $1.6 million is classified in other current liabilities and the remainder of $25.2 million is shown as a long-term liability as a separate line item in the Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2018, a one-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the liability by $3.5 million, while a one-percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by $4.4 million.\nAs a result of the Asset Acquisition, we have significant federal and state NOLs of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively as of December 31, 2018.\na result of a significant capital investment program that we implemented in 2017 to upgrade all key production equipment to\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments excludes some, but not all, items that affect net loss and our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that presented by other companies.\nInterest expense of $16.6 million, or 23.2% of total revenues, represents interest on liabilities subject to compromise, which were attributed to the Predecessor.\nWe are a large scale, low cost U.S.-based producer and exporter of premium met coal operating two highly productive underground mines in Alabama. As of December 31, 2018, Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, our two operating mines, had approximately 108.3 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and our undeveloped Blue Creek Energy Mine contained 103.0 million metric tons of recoverable reserves. As a result of our high quality coal, our realized price has historically been in line with, or at a slight discount to, the Platts Index. Our HCC, mined from the Southern Appalachian portion of the Blue Creek coal seam, is characterized by low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, and LV to MV. These qualities make our coal ideally suited as a coking coal for the manufacture of steel.\n (2) Represents non-cash stock compensation expense associated with equity awards. \n (2) We entered into a new initial CBA with the UMWA pursuant to which we agreed to contribute $25.0 million to a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association ( VEBA\u201d) trust formed and administered by the UMWA.  Adjusted EBITDA\nStock Repurchase\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nOn April 3, 2018, our board of directors declared the April Special Dividend of approximately $350.0 million, which was funded with the net proceeds from the offering of the New Notes due 2024, together with cash on hand of approximately $225.0 million, and was paid on April 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018.\n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight into our operating performance, and reflects how management analyzes our operating performance and compares that performance against other companies on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that cash costs of sales presents a useful measure of our controllable costs and our operational results by including all costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it free-on-board at the Port of Mobile. Period-to-period comparisons of cash cost of sales are intended to help management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our Company that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of cost of sales. Cash cost of sales should not be considered an alternative to cost of sales or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Cash cost of sales excludes some, but not all, items that affect cost of sales, and our presentation may vary from the presentations of other companies. As a result, cash cost of sales as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nshipments. Our gross price realization now represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on the blended gross sales of our LV and MV coal, excluding demurrage and quality specification adjustments, as a percentage of the Platts Index daily price. Our gross price realizations reflect the premiums and discounts we achieve on our LV and MV coal versus the Platts Index price because of the high quality premium products we sell into the export markets. In addition, the premiums and discounts in a quarter or year can be impacted by a rising or falling price environment.\n (6) Represents idle costs incurred, such as electricity, insurance and maintenance labor. This mine was idled in early 2016 and restarted in August 2016. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; \nRights Offerings\nCash Cost of Sales\nNet cash used in operating activities was $40.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor), and was primarily attributed to a net loss of $61.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of $29.0 million, non-cash reorganization items of $18.9 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of $10.2 million and accretion of asset retirement obligations of $1.2 million, offset partially by a net decrease in our working capital of $1.6 million. The net decrease in our working capital was primarily driven by higher disbursements for accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the period associated with our purchases from vendors, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable.\nThe Notes will mature on November 1, 2024 and interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2018.\nInvesting Activities\napproximately $15.0 million.\n \u2022 modification of mining plans or mining methods.  Each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production,\n\nGoing forward, we will need cash to fund debt service payments on our Notes and our other indebtedness and to fund operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. Our ability to fund our capital needs going forward will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, and, in the case of any future strategic investments, capital expenditures or special dividends financed partially or wholly with debt financing, our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital. We believe that our future cash flow from operations, together with cash on our balance sheet and borrowing availability under our ABL Facility, will provide adequate resources to fund our debt service payments and planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; \nOn March 1, 2018, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the \"New Notes\") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (\"Regulation S\"). The New Notes were issued at 103.00% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest from November 2, 2017. The New Notes were issued as \"Additional Notes\" under the indenture dated as of November 2, 2017 (the \"Original Indenture\") among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\") and priority lien collateral trustee (the \"Priority Lien Collateral Trustee\"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2018 (the \"First Supplemental Indenture\" and, the Original Indenture as supplemented thereby, the \"Indenture\"). The New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the New Notes, together with cash on hand of $225.0 million, to pay a special dividend of approximately $350.0 million, or $6.53 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis on April 20, 2018 (the \"April Special Dividend\").\nincome tax receivable was due to refundable AMT credits which will be received in 2019 through 2022 for the 2018 through\nThe combined financial statements of our Predecessor included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other historical Predecessor combined financial information presented and discussed in this management's discussion and analysis may not be indicative of what our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would actually have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nDuring 2018, we continued our trend of sustained profitability, recording a pre-tax profit of $471.0 million for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2018, after considering all relevant factors, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets, the significant relevant factors that we considered are: (1) our recent history of profitability; (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies; (3) estimates of future HCC prices; (4) we moved from a three-year cumulative loss position to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established the full valuation allowance; and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences. Based on this evaluation, at December 31, 2018, we released our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets resulting in the $225.8 million benefit in our provision for income taxes.\nInterest expense, net was $37.3 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $6.9 million, or 0.6% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $30.4 million increase was primarily driven by $36.3 million of additional interest expense on the Notes due to the issuance of $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount on March 1, 2018 and the issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount on November 2, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $36.6 million, or 2.7% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $36.5 million, or 3.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $0.2 million increase is driven primarily by an increase in employee bonuses based on our performance through the year end December 31, 2018.\nCash balances were $205.6 million, $35.5 million and $150.0 million at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nthe average selling price per metric ton of our coal coupled with an increase in metric tons sold. The increase in our long-term\nSales, production and cost of sales components on a per unit basis for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cash cost of sales to total cost of sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\n\nSales were $65.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and were comprised of met coal sales of 0.8 million metric tons at an average selling price of $83.85 per metric ton.\nIf our cash flows from operations are less than we require, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe we can currently finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, (iii) the current state of the global economy and (iv) restrictions in our ABL Facility, the indenture governing the Notes and any other existing or future debt agreements. There can be no assurance that we will have or continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOn November 2, 2017, we consummated a private offering (the Offering\u201d) of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $340.0 million from the Offering, together with cash on hand of approximately $260.0 million, to pay a special cash dividend of approximately $600.0 million, or $11.21 per share, to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis (the \"November Special Dividend\").\nmillion in the aggregate, payment of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million, retirements of debt of $3.1 million, offset partially by\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2018.\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not\u201d that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other things, all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results, our cumulative three-year income or loss position and potential current and future tax planning strategies.\nOther revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.3 million compared to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other revenues are comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, as well as earned royalty revenue. The $9.1 million decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a realized loss of $1.8 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2018 combined with a realized gain of $5.4 million on our natural gas swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAsset Acquisition\n \u2022 assumptions governing future prices; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, restricted cash included $0.8 million in other long-term assets in the Balance Sheet which represents amounts invested in certificate of deposits as financial assurance for post mining reclamation obligations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily comprised of $101.6 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment and $8.9 million of capitalized mine development costs associated with our Mine 4 development. We spent approximately $69.0 million in sustaining capital and spent an additional $33.0 million in other discretionary capital, which included the construction of a new portal at Mine No. 7.

large-scale, low cost U.S. producer and exporter of premium met coal operating two highly productive underground mines in Alabama. \n- The company has significant coal reserves and its coal quality makes it well-suited as a coking coal for steel manufacturing.\n\nResults of Operations\n- In 2018, Warrior Met Coal had revenues of $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2017, due to higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices. Net income was $696.8 million in 2018 compared to $455.0 million in 2017.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- In 2018, the company generated $559.4 million in cash from operations. It spent $107.6 million on investing activities and used $281.6 million for financing activities, primarily for dividends and share repurchases.  \n- The company has strong liquidity of $326 million as of December 2018 to fund operations and capital expenditures.\n\nCapital Allocation\n- In 2018, the company returned $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It remains committed to returning cash through dividends and buybacks.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n- Key estimates relate to coal reserves, asset retirement obligations, and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact. In 2018, the company released a $225.8 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\n\nOutlook\n- For 2019, the company expects capital expenditures of $100-120 million to further improve operations and efficiency. It believes cash flow will adequately fund debt payments, operations, capex needs over the next 12 months."}
