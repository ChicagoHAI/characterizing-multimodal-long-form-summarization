The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in the \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" and Risk Factors\" sections of this Annual Report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nDiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in the respective sections within \"Part II. Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of operations\" of our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a financial holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. We operate primarily through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, FirstBank, the third largest bank headquartered in Tennessee, based on total assets. FirstBank provides a comprehensive suite of commercial and consumer banking services to clients in select markets in Tennessee, North Alabama, Southern Kentucky, and North Georgia. As of December 31, 2020, our footprint included 81 full-service branches serving the following Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Areas ( MSAs\u201d): Nashville, Chattanooga (including North Georgia), Knoxville, Memphis, and Jackson in addition to Bowling Green, Kentucky and Florence and Huntsville, Alabama. We also provide banking services to 16 community markets throughout Tennessee and North Georgia. FirstBank also provides mortgage banking services utilizing its bank branch network and mortgage banking offices strategically located throughout the southeastern United States in addition to a national internet delivery channel. As of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $11.21 billion, loans held for investment of $7.08 billion, total deposits of $9.46 billion, and total shareholders' equity of $1.29 billion.\nWe operate through two segments, Banking and Mortgage. We generate most of our revenue in our Banking segment from interest on loans and investments, loan-related fees, mortgage originations from mortgage offices within our banking footprint, trust and investment services and deposit-related fees. Our primary source of funding for our loans is customer deposits, and, to a lesser extent, unsecured credit lines, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances, brokered and internet deposits, and other borrowings. We generate most of our revenue in our Mortgage segment from origination fees and gains on sales in the secondary market of mortgage loans that we originate from our mortgage offices outside our Banking footprint and through our online ConsumerDirect channel, as well as from mortgage servicing revenues.\nDevelopments in 2020\nMergers and acquisitions\nFranklin Financial Network, Inc.\nOn August 15, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Franklin Financial Network, Inc (\"Franklin\"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired total assets of $3.63 billion, loans of $2.79 billion and assumed total deposits of $3.12 billion. Total loans acquired included a non-strategic institutional portfolio with a fair value of $326.2 million the Company classified as held for sale. Franklin common shareholders received 15,058,181 shares of the Company's common stock, net of the equivalent value of 44,311 shares withheld on certain Franklin employee equity awards that vested upon change in control, as consideration in connection with the merger, in addition to $31.3 million in cash consideration. The Company also issued replacement restricted stock units to replace those initially granted by Franklin in 2020 that did not vest upon change in control, with a total fair value of $0.7 million attributed to pre-combination service. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $29.52 on August 15, 2020, the merger consideration represented approximately $477.8 million in aggregate consideration.\nThe merger resulted in goodwill of $67.2 million being recorded based on the fair value of total assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction.\nThe transaction added a new subsidiary to the Company, FirstBank Risk Management (\"FBRM\"), which provides risk management services to the Company in the form of enhanced insurance coverages. It also added a new subsidiary to the Bank, FirstBank Investments of Tennessee, Inc. (\"FBIT\"), which provides investment services to the Bank. FBIT has a wholly owned subsidiary, FirstBank Investments of Nevada, Inc. (\"FBIN\") to provide investment services to FBIT. FBIN has a controlling interest in a subsidiary, FirstBank Preferred Capital, Inc. (\"FBPC\"), which serves as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), to allow the Bank to sell real estate loans to the REIT to obtain a tax benefit.\nFNB Financial Corp. merger\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of FNB Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmers National Bank of Scottsville (collectively, \"Farmers National\"). Following the acquisition, Farmers National was merged into the Company with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. The Company acquired total assets of $258.2 million, loans of $182.2 million and deposits of $209.5 million. The consideration is valued at approximately $50.0 million based on 954,797 shares of the Company's common stock (utilizing the Company's market price of $36.70 on February 14, 2020) and $15.0 million in cash consideration. The acquisition resulted in $6.3 million of goodwill.\nCOVID-19 and the CARES Act\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 health pandemic created a crisis resulting in volatility in financial markets, sudden, unprecedented job losses, and disruption in consumer and commercial behavior, resulting in governments in the United States and globally to intervene with varying levels of direct monetary support and fiscal stimulus packages. All industries, municipalities and consumers have been impacted by the health crisis to some degree, including the markets that we serve. In attempts to flatten the curve\u201d, businesses not deemed essential were closed or constrained to capacity limitations, individuals were asked to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses, leading to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, widening of credit spreads, dislocation of bond markets, disruption of global supply chains and changes in consumer spending behavior. As certain restrictions began lifting and more businesses were allowed to open their doors in late 2020, we began to experience a slow improvement in commerce through much of our footprint. Despite the pickup in economic activity late in the year, there is uncertainty regarding the long term effects on the global economy which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), a nearly $670 billion program, as amended, designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee up to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs, including rent and other operating costs, to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to continue paying bills. Over the course of 2020, we originated over 2,900 PPP loans, with $314,678 in total balances through the US Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). The SBA began accepting PPP forgiveness applications in the last quarter of 2020, which decreased total balances to $212,645 as of December 31, 2020. Balances will continue to decline throughout 2021 as the SBA continues accepting forgiveness applications.\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act (\"CAA\") that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the HHSB Act\u201d). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. In addition to extending and amending the PPP, the HHSB Act also creates a new grant program for shuttered venue operators.\u201d As a participating lender in the PPP, the Company continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.\nOn March 22, 2020, a statement was issued by our banking regulators and titled the Interagency Statement on Loan\nModifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\u201d (the Interagency Statement\u201d) that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further stipulated that a qualified loan modification was exempt by law from classification as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020, or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic is terminated. Section 541 of the CAA\nextends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators' views on consumer protection considerations.\nWe have numerous customers that have experienced financial distress, as a direct result of COVID-19, and in response we introduced a payment deferral program to assist during these unprecedented times. The total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status was $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2020. We had a recorded investment in loans remaining on Company-sponsored deferred payment programs totaling $202.5 million as of December 31, 2020 , representing approximately 2.9% of our loans held for investment. Of the loans granted deferrals, these modifications typically range between sixty to ninety days and were not considered TDRs under the interagency regulatory guidance or the CARES Act. Additionally, we service mortgages on behalf of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, and as of December 31, 2020 approximately 6% of customers serviced on behalf of the aforementioned companies have received forbearance assistance. COVID-19 is expected to continue to influence commerce worldwide and the magnitude to which our financial results will be impacted is uncertain at this time.\nKey factors affecting our business\nInterest rates\nNet interest income is the largest contributor to our net income and is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board and market interest rates.\nThe cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, which are primarily driven by the Federal Reserve Board's actions. The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and are, at times, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve Board's actions. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, interest rates fell to historic lows during the year ended December 31, 2020. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u2018\u2018FOMC'') reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. On March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve announced it would revive its quantitative easing program to provide liquidity to the U.S. treasury and mortgage markets by committing to buy $500 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $200 billion of agency mortgage backed securities. On March 16, 2020, the FOMC further reduced the target federal funds rate by an additional 100 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. On March 23, 2020 the Federal Reserve modified its quantitative easing program initiative to an unlimited purchase program that is expected to exceed the monetary policy support provided during the financial crisis over 10 years ago. These actions could have significant adverse effects on the earnings, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nFor additional information regarding our interest rate risks factors and management, see Business: Risk management: Liquidity and interest rate risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\nCredit trends\nWe focus on originating quality loans and have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in upholding the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. However, credit trends in the markets in which we operate and in our loan portfolio can materially impact our financial condition and performance and are primarily driven by the economic conditions in our markets.\nDuring 2020, our percentage of total nonperforming loans to loans held for investment increased to 0.91% as of December 31, 2020, from 0.60% at December 31, 2019. Our loans classified as substandard and doubtful increased to 1.87% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2020, compared to 1.82% as of December 31, 2019. Our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 were $84.2 million, or 0.75% of total assets, increasing from $47.1 million, or 0.77% of assets as of December 31, 2019.\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $108.0 million under the current expected credit loss methodology compared with $7.1 million under the previous incurred loss model. Our provision was comprised of $94.6 million related to provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and $13.4 million related to provision for unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was greatly impacted by negative economic forecasts in our loss rate allowance for credit losses model promulgated by the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Economic forecasts slowly improved in the last half of 2020, however we believe the true impact of the pandemic on our loan portfolio could lag beyond the economic turnaround as borrower assistance programs are exhausted. While we continue to be sensitive to credit quality risks in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loan portfolios due to our concentration of loans in these categories, we believe our portfolio is well balanced overall. Although we have not experienced significant credit losses to date, we continue to closely monitor industries that present elevated risk of adverse impact. As of December 31, 2020, loans within these industries we consider \"of concern\" amounted to approximately 23.8% of our total loans held for investment. Additional detail summarizing our exposure to industries \"of concern\" is further discussed under the \"Financial Condition\" subheading within this management's discussion and analysis.\nFor additional information regarding credit quality risk factors for our Company, see Business: Risk management: Credit risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Credit Risks.\u201d\nCompetition\nOur profitability and growth are affected by the highly competitive nature of the financial services industry. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, online mortgage providers, internet banks and other financial institutions operating within the areas we serve, particularly with national and regional banks that often have more resources than we do to invest in growth and technology and community banks with strong local ties, all of which target the same clients we do. Recently, we have seen increased competitive pressures on loan rates. Continued loan pricing pressure may continue to affect our financial results in the future.\nFor additional information, see Business: Our markets,\u201d Business: Competition\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\nRegulatory trends and changes in laws\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change. The current operating environment also has heightened supervisory expectations in areas such as consumer compliance, the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance, risk management and internal audit. As a result of our increase in asset size above $10 billion and these heightened expectations, we expect to incur additional costs for additional compliance, risk management and audit personnel or professional fees associated with advisors and consultants.\nAs described further under Business: Supervision and regulation,\u201d we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act.\nSee also Risk factors: Legal, regulatory and compliance risk\u201d.\nOverview of recent financial performance\nResults of operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nOur net income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $63.6 million from $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.67 and $2.65 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net income represented a ROAA of 0.75% and 1.45% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ROAE of 6.58% and 11.6% for the same periods. Our ratio of ROATCE for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 8.54% and 15.4%, respectively.\nThese results were significantly impacted by the economic forecasts incorporated in our CECL loss rate model, leading our provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments increased to $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our results were also impacted by an increase in merger expenses that totaled $34.9 million relating to our acquisitions of Franklin\nand Farmers National during year ended December 31, 2020 compared with merger expenses of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of the Branches.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to $265.7 million compared with $226.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, influenced by declining interest rates during the current period.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $166.5 million to $301.9 million, up from $135.4 million for prior year period. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage banking income of $154.4 million to $255.3 million.\nNoninterest expense increased to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in noninterest expense is reflective of the increase in mortgage commissions stemming from elevated business activity, as well as the impact of our acquisitions and integration activities, including increases in salaries, commissions and personnel-related costs from the incremental head count.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year ended December 31, 2018\nOur net income increased by 4.46% in 2019 to $83.8 million from $80.2 million in 2018. Pre-tax net income increased by $3.7 million, or 3.48%, from $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.65 and $2.55 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our net income represented a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.45% and 1.66% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a return on average shareholders' equity, or ROAE, of 11.6% and 12.7% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our ratio of return on average tangible common equity (\"ROATCE\") for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 15.4% and 16.7%, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $226.0 million compared to $204.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was attributable to an increase in interest income and expense, primarily driven by loan and deposit growth driven by declining interest rates and our growth initiatives, including the Atlantic Capital branch acquisition.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the increase in cost of funds partially offset by an increase in contractual loan yield earned on our loan portfolio.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.8 million to $135.4 million from $130.6 million from the same period in the previous year. The increase in noninterest income was largely a result of an increase in ATM and interchange fees related to our growth and volume of business.\nNoninterest expense increased to $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $223.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018. The increase in noninterest expense reflects the impact of our acquisition of the Branches, including increases in salaries, commissions and personnel-related costs and increased merger expenses. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 also reflects expenses of $2.0 million related to the sale of our wholesale mortgage origination channels comprising the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent origination channels (collectively referred to as \"mortgage restructuring\").\nFinancial condition\nOur total assets grew by 83.0% to $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.12 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects additions through acquisitions amounting to $3.63 billion and $258.2 million from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, which closed on August 15, 2020 and February 14, 2020, respectively. Loans held for investment increased $2.67 billion to $7.08 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.41 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for investment for the year ended 2020 includes $2.43 billion and $182.2 million of loans acquired from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, as well as $212.6 million of PPP loans outstanding as part of the CARES Act.\nWe grew total deposits by $4.52 billion to $9.46 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.93 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase includes $3.12 billion of deposits assumed in the Franklin acquisition and $209.5 million assumed in the Farmers National acquisition.\nExcluding the impact of our merger and acquisition activities, as well as the PPP loans included in loans held for investment, total assets increased 16.0%, total loans decreased 3.4%, and total deposits increased 24.2%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\nBusiness segment highlights\nWe operate our business in two business segments: Banking and Mortgage. See Note 21, Segment reporting\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these business segments.\nBanking\nIncome before taxes from the Banking segment decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $5.9 million, compared to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These results were primarily driven by the provisions for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments totaling $108.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $7.1 million in the previous year. Net interest income increased $39.5 million to $265.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $226.1 million in the same period in the prior year. Noninterest income increased to $122.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $64.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Noninterest expense increased $96.8 million, primarily due to merger and other costs associated with our overall growth, including increased salaries, commissions and employee benefits expenses associated with incremental headcount following our acquisitions. Results of our Banking Segment also include mortgage retail footprint pre-tax net contribution of $26.4 million and $7.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMortgage\nIncome before taxes from the Mortgage segment increased to $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased volume driven by declining interest rates and an increase in refinancing activity. The increase in volume contributed to noninterest income increasing $109.4 million to $179.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $103.4 million and $68.0 million, respectively. This increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 is mainly attributable to a continued increase in business activity and the result of a conducive interest rate environment for refinancing during the period, which led to an increase in related commissions and incentives expenses.\nDuring 2019, we made a strategic decision to sell our wholesale mortgage operations, which comprise the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent mortgage delivery channels. The exit of the two wholesale channels better aligns the Mortgage segment with our strategic plan and long-term vision for the Company. This has also allowed additional focus on our retail and Consumer Direct origination channels. In connection with the mortgage restructuring, the Company incurred related expenses, including $0.1 million attributed to the relief of goodwill, totaling $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\nResults of operations\nThroughout the following discussion of our operating results, we present our net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis. The fully tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, which enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nThe adjustment to convert certain income to a tax-equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and blended state statutory income tax rate of 26.06% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, generally comprising over 50% of our total revenues in a given period. Net interest income and margin are shaped by many factors, primarily the volume, term structure and mix of earning assets, funding mechanisms, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In response to economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve remains committed to using all available tools to support the economy and uphold their\ndual mandate of full employment and stable prices. The FOMC maintained the Federal Funds rate to zero lower bound, and maintained their commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. During the last half of 2020, the US Treasury yield curve steepened as long-term rates rose. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to continue having a negative impact on net interest income. Other financial impacts could occur, though such potential impacts are unknown at this time.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $40.6 million to $268.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $227.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in loan volume influenced by the Franklin merger, which was also impacted by a decrease in overall cost of deposits.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $317.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $284.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $33.1 million. Interest income on loans held for investment, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $27.4 million to $278.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased loan volume driven by growth in average loan balances of $1.47 billion. The growth in average loan balance reflects the addition of $182.2 million in loans acquired from Farmers National and $2.43 billion in loans acquired in the Franklin merger. In addition, the origination of PPP loans during the period contributed $206.8 million to the increase in average total loans held for investment.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on loans held for investment was 4.95%, down 109 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in yield was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and was also impacted by lower-yielding PPP loans originated during the period. Contractual loan interest rates yielded 4.57% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 5.50% in the year ended December 31, 2019. PPP loans contribute 14 basis points of this decline in contractual loan yield.\nThe components of our loan yield, a key driver to our NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest\nincome </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nyield </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest\nincome </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nyield </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest\nincome </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nyield </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan yield components: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual interest rate on loans held for\ninvestment (1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Origination and other loan fee income (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion on purchased loans </td> <td> </td> <td>3,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual interest collections </td> <td> </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndicated loan fee income </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan yield </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes tax-equivalent adjustment.\n(2)Includes $2.09 million of loan contractual interest and $3.92 million of loan fees related to PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAccretion on purchased loans contributed 5 and 16 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in accretion is due in part to the adoption of CECL and purchase accounting resulting from our merger with Franklin, that contributed a net premium of $11.3 million recorded as of August 15, 2020, to be amortized as a reduction to loan interest income. Contractual interest and origination fees on PPP loans attributed 8 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020. We anticipate recognizing an estimated $2.7 million in deferred origination fees, net of third party costs and deferred salaries, over the remaining life of the PPP loan portfolio.\nOur NIM, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% during the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.34% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a declining interest rate environment and change in balance sheet mix, partially attributable to our acquisition of Franklin during the year.\nInterest expense was $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $7.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver was the impact of the decrease in interest rates on deposits, resulting in total deposit interest expense decrease of $8.7 million to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was largely attributed to money market deposits which decreased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and customer time deposits which decreased to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate on money markets decreased to 0.76%, down 66 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. Average money market balances increased $587.8 million to $1,807.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,219.7 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease in interest expense on customer time deposits was primarily driven by decreased interest rates as the average rate on customer time deposits decreased 57 basis points from 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.52% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of deposits was 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.10% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAverage balance sheet amounts, interest earned and yield analysis\nThe

The increase in loan interest income was driven by an increase in average loans held for investment of $1.47 billion, or 35.5%, to $5.62 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely attributable to the acquisition of $182.2 million in loans from the Farmers National acquisition and $2.43 billion in loans from the Franklin merger plus an increase of $206.8 million in average PPP loans. The total decrease in interest expense of $7.5 million was primarily driven by decreases in rates on money market and customer time deposits partially offset by increase in volume, partially related to our acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to\nyear ended December 31, 2018\ndue to changes in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands on a tax-equivalent basis) </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Net increase\n(decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-earning assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,573) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,822) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,844) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,666) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities available for sale and other securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable </td> <td> </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>826 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax Exempt(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(482) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds sold and balances at Federal Reserve Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits in other financial institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>1,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB stock </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest income(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>47,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,097) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing checking </td> <td> </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,267 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>2,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>8,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered and internet time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>(836) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(443) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Home Loan Bank advances </td> <td> </td> <td>(457) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(705) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,162) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>10,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in net interest income(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,459) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,262 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Average loans are gross, including nonaccrual loans and overdrafts (before deduction of allowance for loan losses).

The determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. We adopted the expected credit loss methodology under FASB ASC Topic 326 on January 1, 2020. The change in methodology from the previous incurred loss model in place prior to adoption requires additional inputs and the use of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to estimate loan losses for the entire life of the loan portfolio. As such, the results between models are not necessarily comparable. Refer to Note 1, \"Basis of presentation\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion regarding ACL methodology.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $94.6 million as compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The steep increase in provision for credit losses was primarily the result of conforming the acquired loan portfolios to comply with CECL under our established framework and governance model, as CECL requires the establishment of an allowance for credit losses for non-purchased credit deteriorated loans be recognized through the provision for credit losses on the acquisition date. In addition to the impact of the acquired portfolios during the year, our provision for credit losses was impacted by declining economic forecasts resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Farmers National acquisition on February 14, 2020 amounted to $2.9 million while the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Franklin merger on August 15, 2020 amounted to $52.8 million. The remaining $38.9 million included in the provision for credit losses is reflective of activity for both the Company's legacy non-acquired portfolios and the acquired portfolios of Farmers National and Franklin from their respective acquisition dates through the remainder of 2020. Although the portfolio benefited from improving economic forecasts in the last half of 2020, there is much uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to lead to increased volatility in forecasted macroeconomic variables, a key input to our calculated level of allowance for credit losses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we determined that all available-for-sale debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses recognized on available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate expected credit loss, the Company considers the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions. As such, the Company recorded provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee the section captioned \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" for more information regarding the Company's ACL methodology.\nNoninterest income\nOur noninterest income includes gains on sales of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of loans held for sale and derivatives, fees on mortgage loan originations, loan servicing fees, hedging results, fees generated from deposit services, investment services and trust income, gains and losses on securities, other real estate owned and other assets and other miscellaneous noninterest income.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>255,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,661 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ATM and interchange fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment services and trust income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) from securities, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,491) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain from other assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(104) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,642 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nNoninterest income amounted to $301.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $166.5 million, or 122.9%, as compared to $135.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest income in the above table are discussed below.\nMortgage banking income primarily includes origination fees and realized gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of mortgage loans and derivatives, and mortgage servicing fees, which includes net change in fair value of MSRs and related derivatives. Mortgage banking income is initially driven by the recognition of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) at fair value at inception of the IRLCs. This is subsequently adjusted for changes in the overall interest rate environment offset by derivative contracts entered into to mitigate the interest rate exposure. Upon sale of the loan, the net fair value gain is reclassified as a realized gain on sale. Mortgage banking income was $255.3 million and $100.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a 153.0% increase year-over-year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank's mortgage operations had sales of $6.24 billion which generated a gain on sales margin of 3.79%. This compares to $4.55 billion and 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gain on sales margin is a result of the mortgage restructuring in 2019, and productive market conditions in 2020. The industry benefited greatly from declining interest rates in 2020, causing a sharp increase in volume in 2020. Mortgage banking income from gains on sale and related fair value changes increased to $267.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total interest rate lock volume increased $3,036.0 million, or 51.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. The volume mix of refinances and purchases also shifted during year ended December 31, 2020 to 77.6% refinance volume compared with 56.2% during the previous year.\nOur mortgage banking business is directly impacted by the interest rate environment, regulatory environment, consumer demand, economic conditions, and investor demand for mortgage securities. Mortgage production, especially refinance activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. While we have not yet experienced significant slowdowns in our mortgage production volume, our interest rate lock volume is expected to be materially and adversely impacted by rising interest rates, and we expect to see declining refinance activity within the mortgage industry when rates rise.\nIncome from mortgage servicing of $22.1 million and $17.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was offset by declines in fair value of MSRs and related hedging activity of $34.4 million and $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe

segment from retail operations within the Bank footprint was $75.4 million and $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and mortgage banking income attributable to our Mortgage segment was $179.9 million and $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $8.2 million to $15.3 million as compared to other noninterest income of $7.1 million for year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects a gain on commercial loans held for sale of $3.2 million related to changes in fair value from Franklin acquisition date to the end of 2020. Additionally, the increase reflect reflects increased swap fee income in addition to overall increases due to our growth and volume of business.\nNoninterest expense\nOur noninterest expense includes primarily salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense, legal and professional fees, data processing expense, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, advertising and promotion and other real estate owned expense, among others. We monitor the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, which is commonly known as the efficiency ratio.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, commissions and employee benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,976 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,903 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of core deposit and other intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nNoninterest expense increased by $132.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $377.1 million as compared to $244.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest expense in the above table are discussed below.\nSalaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expenses representing 62.0% and 62.1% of total noninterest expense in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $81.7 million, or 53.7%, to $233.8 million as compared to $152.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly driven by our increase in headcount as a result of our mergers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, FTE's increased to 1,852 as of December 31, 2020 from 1,377 as of December 31, 2019. Also included in total salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was an increase of $41.8 million in commissions and incentives expenses resulting from increased mortgage production previously discussed.\nCosts resulting from our equity compensation grants during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $10.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively. These grants comprise restricted stock units granted to all new full-time associates each year in addition to annual performance grants, employment agreement grants and grants resulting from acquisition. Additionally, during 2020 we began granting performance-based stock units, which resulted in $1.0 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMerger costs amounted to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, merger costs consisted of $7.7 million of contract termination costs, $5.6 million of branch closing and consolidation costs, $7.7 million of professional fees, $6.6 million of severance and separation benefits, $4.5 million of conversion-related costs, and $2.7 million of other acquisition-related costs. Costs during the previous year were related to our acquisition of the Branches, which closed during the second quarter of the previous year. We anticipate to continue incurring severance and separation benefits through the first half of 2021 for certain merger-related employment agreements.\nOther noninterest expense primarily includes mortgage servicing expenses, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, software license and maintenance fees and various other miscellaneous expenses. Other noninterest expense increased $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $55.0 million compared to $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects costs associated with our growth, including the impact of our acquisitions, as well as a one-time prepayment penalty of $6.8 million, incurred in connection with our repayment of $150.0 million in long-term advances and $100.0 million in 90 day fixed rate advances.\nEfficiency ratio\nThe efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. For an adjusted efficiency ratio, we exclude certain gains, losses and expenses we do not consider core to our business.\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.4% and 67.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 59.2% and 65.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in this Report for a discussion of the adjusted efficiency ratio.\nReturn on equity and assets\nThe following table sets forth our ROAA, ROAE, dividend payout ratio and average shareholders' equity to average assets ratio for the periods indicated:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.45 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend payout ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average shareholders' equity to average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized significant increases in our provision for credit losses and merger costs, which resulted in return on average total assets of 0.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average shareholders' equity was 6.58% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $18.8 million and $25.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This represents effective tax rates of 22.84% and 23.48% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary differences from the enacted rates are applicable state income taxes reduced for non-taxable income and tax credits, and additional deductions for equity-based compensation upon the distribution of restricted stock units.\nFinancial condition\nThe following discussion of our financial condition compares balances as of December 31, 2020 with December 31, 2019.\nTotal assets\nOur total assets were $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to total assets of $6.12 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to our acquisition of Farmers National, completed on February 14, 2020 and merger with Franklin on August 15, 2020, which added assets of $258.2 million and $3.63 billion, respectively, combined with our participation in the PPP. Additionally, the increase is partially related to the $212.6 million of outstanding PPP loans at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.32 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.09 billion during the year 2020, up from $232.7 million at December 31, 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure adequate liquidity.\nLoan portfolio\nOur loan portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 63.2% and 72.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. Our overall lending approach is primarily focused on providing credit to our customers directly rather than purchasing loan syndications and loan participations from other banks (collectively, participated loans\u201d). At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans held for investment included approximately $206.8 million and $103.4 million, respectively, related to purchased participation loans. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations.\nLoans by type\nThe following table sets forth the balance and

loans originated as part of the PPP at December 31, 2020, established by the CARES Act, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is administered by the SBA; loans originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules.\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than the categories of loans disclosed in the table above. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified relative to industry concentrations across the various loan portfolio categories. While most industries have and are expected to continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of COVID-19, certain industries present more risk than others. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding loan principal balances of loans in deferral status amounted to $202.5 million. The following presents industry loan categories considered to be of concern\u201d in relation to our total portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry </td> <td>Approximate % of\ntotal loans </td> <td>Description of components </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail lending </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td>Includes non-owner occupied CRE, automobile, recreational vehicle and boat dealers, gas stations and convenience stores, pharmacies and drug stores, and sporting goods. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td>Includes assisted living, nursing and continuing care, medical practices, social assistance, mental health and substance abuse centers. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td>Vast majority of hotel exposure is built around long-term successful hotel operators and strong flags located within our banking footprint. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other leisure </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td>Includes marinas, recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds, fitness and recreational sports centers, sports teams and clubs, historical sites, and theaters. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>Includes trucking exposure made up of truckload operators, equipment lessors to owner/operators, and local franchisees of major national trucking companies.

The construction concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding construction and land development loans to total tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. The commercial real estate concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and construction and land development loans to tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. Management strives to operate within the thresholds set forth above.\nWhen a company's ratios are in excess of one or both of these guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by management.\nThe table below shows concentration ratios for the Bank and Company as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, which both were within the stated thresholds.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As a percentage (%) of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FirstBank </td> <td> </td> <td>FB Financial Corporation </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>228.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>237.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>88.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>87.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>247.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>243.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan categories\nThe principal categories of our loans held for investment portfolio are discussed below:\nCommercial and industrial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. Our commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital and operating needs and business expansions, including the purchase of capital equipment and loans made to farmers relating to their operations. This category also includes loans secured by manufactured housing receivables. Commercial and industrial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. This category also includes the loans we originated as part of the PPP, established by the CARES Act. The PPP is administered by the SBA, and loans we originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules. These federally guaranteed loans were intended to provide up to 24 weeks of payroll and other operating costs as a source of aid to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are generally made with operating cash flows as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and personal guarantees. We plan to continue to make commercial and industrial loans an area of emphasis in our lending operations in the future. Excluding PPP loans totaling $212.6 million as of December 31, 2020, our commercial and industrial loans comprised $1,133.5 million, or 16% of our loans held for investment.\nCommercial real estate owner-occupied loans. Our commercial real estate owner-occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate owner occupied properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, production facilities, health care facilities, retail centers, restaurants, churches and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower, and hence are dependent on the success of the underlying business for repayment and are more exposed to general economic conditions.\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied loans. Our commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate non-owner occupied investment properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, health care facilities, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial, manufactured housing communities, retail centers, multifamily properties, assisted living facilities and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale of the completed property or rental proceeds from such property, and are therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market, which can also be affected by general economic conditions.\nResidential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. Our residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, including manufactured homes with real estate, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. We intend to continue to make residential 1-4 family housing loans at a similar pace, so long as housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. First lien residential 1-4 family mortgages may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nResidential line of credit loans. Our residential line of credit loans are primarily revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential properties. We intend to continue to make residential line of credit loans if housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. Residential line of credit loans may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nMulti-family residential loans. Our multi-family residential loans are primarily secured by multi-family properties, such as apartments and condominium buildings. These loans may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nConstruction loans. Our construction loans include commercial construction, land acquisition and land development loans and single-family interim construction loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals. These loans are generally secured by the land or the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis. We expect to continue to make construction loans at a similar pace so long as demand continues and the market for and values of such properties remain stable or continue to improve in our markets. These loans can carry risk of repayment when projects incur cost overruns, have an increase in the price of building materials, encounter zoning and environmental issues, or encounter other factors that may affect the completion of a project on time and on budget. Additionally, repayment risk may be negatively impacted when the market experiences a deterioration in the value of real estate.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans include consumer loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans are generally secured by vehicles and other household goods. The collateral securing consumer loans may depreciate over time. The company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards. Other loans also include loans to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. These loans are generally subject to the risk that the borrowing municipality or political subdivision may lose a significant portion of its tax base or that the project for which the loan was made may produce inadequate revenue. None of these categories of loans represents a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nLoan maturity and sensitivities\nThe following tables present the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Loans with scheduled maturities are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. Demand loans with no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported in the due in 1 year or less\u201d category. Loans that have adjustable rates are shown as amortizing to final maturity rather than when the interest rates are next subject to change. The tables do not include prepayment assumptions or scheduled repayments. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $22.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively, in fixed-rate loans in which the Company has entered into variable rate swap contracts.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

originating loans that we believe to be of high quality. We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions, including extensions or interest rate modifications, to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans, which can result in us carrying higher nonperforming assets. We believe this practice leads to higher recoveries in the long-term.\nNonperforming assets\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and other miscellaneous non-earning assets. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. In our loan review process, we seek to identify and proactively address nonperforming loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $84.2 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included $5.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of excess land and facilities held for sale resulting from our acquisitions. Other nonperforming assets, including other repossessed non-real estate, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 amounted to $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nWe had net interest recoveries on nonperforming assets previously charged off of $1.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $151.2 million and $51.7 million of delinquent GNMA loans that had previously been sold; however, we determined there not to be a more-than-trivial benefit of rebooking based on an analysis of interest rates and an assessment of potential reputational risk associated with these loans. As such, these were not recorded on our balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nThe following table provides details of our nonperforming assets, the ratio of such loans and other nonperforming assets to total assets, and certain other related information as of the dates presented:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020. Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Loans not considered nonperforming include loans 30-89 days past due amounting to $27.0 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2019. Periods prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 exclude purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") loans from nonperforming totals while the current period includes PCD loans at their contractual number of days past due. Loans in deferral status are considered current.\nOther real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in addition to excess facilities held for sale. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Reductions in the carrying value subsequent to foreclosure are charged to earnings and are included in Gain on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2020, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $1.8 million, which combined with gains on sales of other real estate, resulted in net losses of $1.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $0.5 million, which combined with net gains on sales of other real estate owned, resulted in a net gain $0.5 million.\nNon-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we offered financial relief in the form of a payment deferral program to those experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These modifications were consistent with the \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\" and the CARES Act and did not qualify as TDRs. As of December 31, 2020, the total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status amounted to $1.40 billion. As of December 31, 2020, recorded balances in total loans remaining in deferral status under this program amounted to $202.5 million. The payment deferrals program differs from forbearance, in that all deferred payments are not normally due at the end of the deferral period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced to a future time period. Generally, interest continues to accrue on loans during the deferral period, unless the loan is on nonaccrual. The vast majority of our loans in deferral status are considered performing loans, and we anticipate collecting on these balances. We remain proactive in monitoring our loans in deferral status by reaching out to our borrowers with payment deferrals to determine their financial capacity and whether additional payment deferrals or other loan modifications are necessary.\nClassified loans\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans that share similar risk characteristics collectively and loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually. See Note 5, Loans and allowance for credit losses\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these risk categories.\nThe following tables set forth information related to the credit quality of our loan portfolio as of the dates presented.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan type (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Pass </td> <td> </td> <td>Watch </td> <td> </td> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td>Doubtful(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,238,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,346,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>1,178,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,222,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-to-4 family mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td>1,025,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,089,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>396,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td>175,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>828,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>924,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,598,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td>294,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317,640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,586,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>364,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,082,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) This category was added in 2020.

changed with the adoption of CECL to a lifetime expected credit loss approach. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adoption, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. We determine the appropriateness of the allowance through periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters. See \"Critical accounting policies - Allowance for credit losses\" for additional information regarding our methodology.\nThe change in accounting estimate as a result of our adoption of CECL increased the ACL as of January 1, 2020 to $62.6 million from the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 of $31.1 million. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $25.0 million, with corresponding adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments in addition to recording a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Included in our transition adjustment as of January 1, 2020 was the cumulative effect adjustment to gross-up the amortized cost amount of purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans by $0.6 million.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $170.4 million and $31.1 million and represented 2.41% and 0.71% of loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Excluding PPP loans with a recorded investment totaling $212.6 million, our ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment would have been 7 basis points higher\nas of December 31, 2020. PPP loans are federally guaranteed as part of the CARES Act, provided PPP loan recipients receive loan forgiveness under the SBA regulations. As such, there is minimal credit risk associated with these loans. Additionally, charge-offs increased to $15,305 as of December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to a single relationship with a charge-off of $9,932.\nIn addition, we evaluated for changes in reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in projected credit deterioration requiring us to recognize significant increases in the ACL. Specifically, we performed additional qualitative evaluations for certain categories within our loan portfolio, in line with our established qualitative framework, weighting the impact of the current economic outlook, status of federal government stimulus programs, and other considerations, in order to identify specific industries or borrowers seeing credit improvement or deterioration specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also increased the ACL by $82.1 million of which $77.7 million related to loans acquired on August 15, 2020, as part of the Franklin acquisition and $4.5 million related to loans acquired on February 14, 2020, as part of the Farmers National acquisition. Outside of the impact of Franklin on the provision for credit losses, the remaining loan portfolio benefited from improved economic forecasts, seen for the first time in 2020, reflective of the resumption of more normalized commercial activity within our markets. See Note 2, \"Mergers and acquisitions\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to PCD loans.\nThe allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments increased to $16.4 million at December 31, 2020, and the deferred tax asset related to the ACL increased to $48.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC (collectively, \"the Agencies\") initially provided an option within the regulatory capital framework to limit the initial regulatory \"day one\" adverse impact by allowing a three-year phase in period for said impact. In March 2020, the Agencies subsequently announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). We elected the five-year capital transition relief option.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category as well as the ratio of loans by loan

loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. The loans had an acquisition date fair value of $326.2 million, which declined to $215.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to loans within the portfolio being paid off through external refinancing. This decrease is also partially offset by a change in fair value after acquisition amounting to a gain of $3.2 million, which is included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nMortgage loans held for sale\nMortgage loans held for sale were $683.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $262.5 million at December 31, 2019. Interest rate lock volume for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $8.94 billion and $5.90 billion, respectively. Generally, mortgage volume increases in lower interest rate environments and robust housing markets and decreases in rising interest rate environments and slower housing markets. The increase in interest rate lock volume for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects the increased volume in our retail and ConsumerDirect channels, which benefited from the lower interest rate environment when compared to the previous year. Interest rate lock commitments in the pipeline were $1.19 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $453.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within fifteen to twenty-five days after the loan is funded, depending on the economic environment and competition in the market. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nDeposits\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. We continue to focus on growing core customer deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy, community-focused marketing programs, and initiatives such as the development of our treasury management services.\nTotal deposits were $9.46 billion and $4.93 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $2.27 billion and $1.21 billion, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $7.18 billion and $3.73 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The 91.7% increase in total deposits from December 31, 2019 is partially attributed to merger and acquisition activity, including growth of $209.5 million in deposits assumed from Farmers National in the first quarter of 2020, and $3.12 billion in deposits assumed from the Franklin merger in the third quarter of 2020. We've also continued focus on core customer deposit growth, and increased escrow deposits that our third party servicing provider, Cenlar, transferred to the Bank.\nBrokered and internet time deposits at December 31, 2020 increased by $41.2 million to $61.6 million compared with $20.4 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was the result of assuming Franklin's brokered and internet time deposits, totaling $107.5 million at August 15, 2020; this balance has declined since acquisition through continued overall balance sheet management as we continue to replace brokered and internet time deposits with less costly funding sources.\nIncluded in noninterest-bearing deposits are certain mortgage escrow and related customer deposits that our third-party servicing provider, Cenlar, transfers to the Bank which totaled $148.0 million and $92.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally, our deposits from municipal and governmental entities (i.e. \"public deposits\") totaled $1,677.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $463.1 million at December 31, 2019.\nOur deposit base also includes certain commercial and high net worth individuals that periodically place deposits with the Bank for short periods of time and can cause fluctuations from period to period in the overall level of customer deposits outstanding. These fluctuations may include certain deposits from related parties as disclosed within Note 25, \"Related party transactions\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Management continues to focus on growing noninterest-bearing deposits while allowing more costly funding sources to mature, repricing downward in our current lower interest rate conditions.\nAverage deposit balances by type, together with the average rates per period are reflected in the average balance sheet amounts, interest paid and rate analysis tables included in this management's discussion and analysis under the subheading \"Results of operations\" discussion.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution by type of our deposit accounts for the dates indicated:\nTable 41:

securities available for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, we may also obtain advances from the FHLB, purchase federal funds and engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve, correspondent banks, or enter into client repurchase agreements. We also use these sources of funds as part of our asset liability management process to control our long-term interest rate risk exposure, even if it may increase our short-term cost of funds.\nOur level of short-term borrowing can fluctuate on a daily basis depending on funding needs and the source of funds to satisfy those needs, in addition to the overall interest rate environment and cost of public funds. Borrowings can include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, federal funds, and subordinated debt.\nThe following table sets forth our total borrowings segmented by years to maturity as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of total </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted average interest rate (%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing Within: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>189,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nWe enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $32.2 million and $23.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Bank maintains lines with certain correspondent banks that provide borrowing capacity in the form of federal funds purchased in the aggregate amount of $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no borrowings against the line at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\nAs a member of the FHLB Cincinnati, the Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various agreements that assist in funding its mortgage and loan portfolio balance sheet. Under the agreements, we pledge qualifying residential mortgages of $1,248.9 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $1,532.7 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $1,276.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we pledged qualifying residential mortgages of $413.0 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $545.5 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $760.6 million.\nThere were no borrowings against the line as of December 31, 2020, while borrowings against the line totaled $250.0 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no FHLB advances as of December 31, 2020, while FHLB advances as of December 31, 2019 includes two long-term advances with putable features totaling $150.0 million. These two long-term advances of $100.0 million and $50.0 million carry maximum final terms of 10 years and 7 years, respectively. However, the FHLB owns the option to cancel the advances after one year and quarterly thereafter at predetermined fixed rates of 1.24% and 1.37%, respectively These putable advances were paid off in the fourth quarter of 2020 at a penalty of $4.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. There were no overnight cash management advances (CMAs) outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Letters of credit with FHLB of $100.0 million and $75.0 million were pledged to secure public funds that required collateral as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no 90-day fixed-rate advances were included in total FHLB advances. The maximum amount of FHLB borrowing outstanding at any month end was $250.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted average interest rate on FHLB borrowings was 0.00% and 1.51% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Bank maintains a line with the Federal Reserve Bank through the Borrower-in-Custody program. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $2.46 billion and $1.41 billion of qualifying loans and $0.0 million and $5.0 million of investment securities were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank, securing a line of credit of $1,695.6 million and $1,013.2 million, respectively.\nSubordinated debt\nWe have two wholly-owned subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts ( Trusts\u201d). The Trusts were created for the sole purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities to fund the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our $0.9 million investment in the Trusts was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and our $30.0 million obligation is reflected as junior subordinated debt, respectively. The junior subordinated debt bears interest at floating interest rates based on a spread over 3-month LIBOR plus 315 basis points (3.40% and 5.10% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the $21.7 million debenture and 3-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points (3.50% and 5.19% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the remaining $9.3 million. The $9.3 million debenture may be redeemed prior to the 2033 maturity date upon the occurrence of a special event, and the $21.7 million debenture may be redeemed prior to 2033 at our option.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of 2020, we placed $100.0 million of ten year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, maturing September 1, 2030. This subordinated note instrument pays interest semi-annually in arrears based on a 4.5% fixed annual interest rate for the first five years of the notes. For years six through ten, the interest rate resets on a quarterly basis, and will be based on the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a spread of 439 basis points. We are entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after September 1, 2025. The Company has classified the issuance, net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,772, as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\nWe also assumed two issues of subordinated debt, totaling $60,000, as part of the Franklin merger. The notes, issued in 2016, feature $40,000 of 6.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due March 30, 2026 (\"March 2026 Subordinated Notes\"), and $20,000 of 7% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due July 1, 2026 (\"July 2026 Subordinated Notes\"). Upon acquisition, we recorded a $0.8 million fair value premium adjustment, and during 2020, we recognized $0.4 million of amortization expense. Both note issuances currently pay interest semi-annually, and will begin resetting interest rates on a quarterly basis after March 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021. For years six through ten, interest for the March 2026 Subordinated Notes will based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 5.636% and interest for the July 2026 Subordinated Notes will be based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 6.04%. We are entitled to redeem in whole or in part after\nthe respective fifth anniversary of each note issuance. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the issuance that we intend to exercise our rights to redeem the $40.0 million note in full during the first quarter of 2021. We classified the entire $60,000 in subordinated notes as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\nOther borrowings\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we initiated a credit line in the amount of $20.0 million (1.75% + 1 month LIBOR in effect 2 business days prior to reprice date) and borrowed $15.0 million against the line to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National transaction. An additional $5.0 million remains available for the Company to draw. This line of credit has a term of one year and matured subsequent to December 31, 2020 on February 21, 2021.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nBank liquidity management\nWe are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk Policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements and otherwise sustain our operations. We accomplish this through management of the maturities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs.\nWe continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and access to funding sources. To date, we have not seen significant pressure on liquidity or sources of funding as a result of COVID-19 and have maintained higher than typical levels of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents to allow for flexibility.\nAs part of our liquidity management strategy, we also focus on minimizing our costs of liquidity and attempt to decrease these costs by growing our noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits, while replacing higher cost funding sources including time deposits and borrowed funds. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer.\nOur investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, securities with a carrying value of $804.8 million and $373.7 million, respectively, were pledged to secure government, public, trust and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings, letters of credit and derivative instruments. Additionally, we have a FHLB letter of credit to secure public funds totaling $100.0 million and $75.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdditional sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased, FHLB borrowings, and lines of credit. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Funds and advances obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. There were no outstanding overnight cash management advances (\"CMAs\") at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of our outstanding additional long-term advances with the FHLB were $0.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The remaining balance available with the FHLB was $1,176.1 million and $435.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit typically maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no borrowings against the lines at December 31, 2020 and at December 31, 2019.\nHolding company liquidity management\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company's ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see the Item 1. Business - Supervision and regulation,\u201d \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks related to our business\" and \" Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy,\" each of which is set forth in our Annual Report.\nDue to state banking laws, the Bank may not declare dividends in any calendar year in an amount exceeding the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years, without the prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (\"TDFI\"). Based upon this regulation, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $185.7 million and $223.7 million of the Bank's retained earnings were available for the payment of dividends without such prior approval. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $48.8 million in cash dividends approved by the board for payment from the Bank to the holding company in addition to an asset dividend of an equity security amounting to $1.0 million. None of these required approval from the TDFI. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the board approved a dividend from the Bank to the holding company for $75.0 million that did not require approval from the TDFI. No dividends from the Bank to the Company were paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared and paid dividends of 0.36 per share, or $14.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared and paid dividends of $0.32 per share, or $10.2 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.11 per share, payable on February 22, 2021, to stockholders of record as of February 8, 2021.\nThe Company is party to a registration rights agreement with its former majority shareholder entered into in connection with the 2016 IPO, under which the Company is responsible for payment of expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) relating to sales to the public by the shareholder of shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by him. Such expenses include registration fees, legal and accounting fees, and printing costs payable by the Company and expensed when incurred. No such expenses were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company obtained a line of credit for $20.0 million, of which $15.0 million was borrowed to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National acquisition.\nCapital management and regulatory capital requirements\nOur capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the TDFI, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the classifications set forth in the following table. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we exceeded all capital ratio requirements under prompt corrective action and other regulatory requirements, as detailed in the table below:\nTable 48:

conservation buffer.\nU.S. Basel III measures capital strength in three tiers and incorporates risk-adjusted assets to determine the risk-based capital ratios. Our CET1 capital primarily includes shareholders' equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangibles, net of taxes, net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities and derivative instruments, net of tax. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital and included junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $30.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Tier 2 capital components include a portion of the allowance for credit losses in excess of Tier 1 statutory limits and our remaining combined trust preferred security debt issuances.\nIn December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.\nCapital Expenditures\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to enter any material capital expenditures over the next twelve months.\nShareholders' equity\nOur total shareholders' equity was $1,291.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $762.3 million, at December 31, 2019. Book value per share was $27.35 at December 31, 2020 and $24.56 at December 31, 2019. The growth in shareholders' equity during 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in additional paid-in capital and common stock; a result of our acquisitive growth strategy through the merger with Franklin and the acquisition of Farmers National. Other changes in shareholders' equity were driven by earnings retention and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by a cumulative effective adjustment of $25.0 million on January 1, 2020 for the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and to a lesser extent, declared dividends and activity related to equity-based compensation.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which in accordance with GAAP, are not included as part of our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit, and commitments to purchase loans, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 17, \"Commitments and contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2020, our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date (excluding interest). These contractual obligations are discussed in more detail within in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 payments due in: </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,687 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,815 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>1,048,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,437,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities sold under agreements to repurchase </td> <td> </td> <td>32,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,199 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,104,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>335,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,742,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical accounting policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and general practices within the banking industry. Within our financial statements, certain financial information contain approximate measurements of financial effects of transactions and impacts at the consolidated balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards and subsequent adoptions, are discussed in further detail in \"Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" of this Report.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters.\nAs of January 1, 2020, our policy for the allowance for credit losses changed with the adoption of CECL. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adopting CECL, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nOur methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses includes the use of lifetime loss rate models. The quantitative models require tailored loan data and macroeconomic variables based on the inherent credit risks in each portfolio to more accurately measure the credit risks associated with each. Each of the quantitative models pools loans with similar risk characteristics and collectively assesses the lifetime loss rate for each pool to estimate its expected credit loss. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in any given pool, the loan is individually assessed.\nWe utilize probability-weighted forecasts, which consider multiple macroeconomic variables from a third-party vendor that are applicable to the type of loan. The choice and weighting of the economic forecast scenarios, macroeconomic variables, and the reasonable and supportable period at the macroeconomic variable-level are reviewed and approved by the forecast governance committee based on expectations of future economic conditions.\nWe consider the need to qualitatively adjust our modeled quantitative expected credit loss estimate for information not already captured in the model loss estimation process. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease our estimate of expected credit losses. We review the qualitative adjustments so as to validate that information that has already been considered and included in the modeled quantitative loss estimation process is not also included in the qualitative adjustment. We consider the qualitative factors that are relevant to the institution as of the reporting date, which may include, but are not limited to: levels of and trends in delinquencies and performance of loans; levels of and trends in write-offs and recoveries collected; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in reasonable and supportable economic forecasts; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; available relevant information sources that contradict our own forecast; effects of changes in prepayment expectations or other factors affecting assessments of loan contractual term; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.\nThe allowance for credit losses is our best estimate. Actual losses may differ from the December 31, 2020 allowance for credit loss as the CECL estimate is sensitive to economic forecasts and management judgment.\nAdditional discussion can be found under the subheading \"Asset quality\" contained within management's discussion and analysis and in \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" and \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5. Loans and allowance for credit losses\" of this Report.\nFair Value Measurements\nA hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. See Note 19 \"Fair Value\" in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities, including a description of the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestment securities\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest, when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Beginning January 1, 2020, unrealized losses resulting from credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings as a provision for credit losses. Unrealized losses that do not result from credit losses are excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, which is included in equity. Accrued interest receivable is separated from other components of amortized cost and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nEquity securities with readily determinable market values are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with any periodic changes in value made through adjustments to the statement of income. Equity securities without readily determinable market values are carried at cost less impairment and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest income includes the amortization and accretion of purchase premium and discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method anticipating prepayments based upon the prior three month average monthly prepayments when available. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.\nWe evaluate available-for-sale securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, we consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition.\nWhen credit losses are expected to occur, the amount of the expected credit loss recognized in earnings depends on our intention to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the expected credit loss recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the date it was determined to be impaired due to credit losses or other factors. The previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.\nHowever, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. If we determine a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale investment security has resulted from credit related factors, beginning January 1, 2020 with the adoption of CECL, we record a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the impairment related to other, non-credit related, factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nWe did not record any provision for credit losses for its available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the majority of the investment portfolio is government guaranteed and declines in fair value below amortized cost were determined to be non-credit related.\nLoans held for sale\nLoans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, primarily mortgage loans, are carried at fair value as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC 825\u201d). Net gains (losses) resulting from fair value changes of these mortgage loans are recorded in income. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both mortgage loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in Mortgage banking income\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses are recognized in Mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income at the time the loan is closed. Pass through origination costs and related loan fees are also included in Mortgage banking income\u201d. Other expenses are classified in the appropriate noninterest expense accounts. Periodically, we will transfer mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary markets into the loan portfolio based on current market conditions, the overall secondary marketability of the loan and the status of the loan. The loans are transferred into the portfolio at fair value at the date of transfer.\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing and was the original transferor. At the servicer's option and without GNMA's prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100 percent of the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing,\u201d this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When we are deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans held for investment, regardless of whether we intend to exercise the buy-back option if the buyback option provides the transferor a more-than-trivial benefit. When repurchased, after meeting certain performance criteria, the loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value and are able to be repooled into a new Ginnie Mae guaranteed security.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. Changes in fair value from the acquisition date fair value are included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nMortgage servicing rights\nThe Company accounts for its mortgage servicing rights under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 860-50-35, \"Transfers and Servicing\". The Company retains the right to service certain mortgage loans that it sells to secondary market investors. The retained mortgage servicing right is initially recorded at the fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors. These mortgage servicing rights are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are recorded as other comprehensive income and are subsequently recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. The assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method.\nWe utilize derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company enters into swaps, interest rate cap and/or floor agreements with its customers and then enters into an offsetting derivative contract position with other financial institutions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts. Because these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.\nWe enter into commitments to originate and purchase loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate-lock commitments). Rate-lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives. Accordingly, such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in other assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. Fair\nvalue is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, and for fixed-rate commitments, the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates is also considered.\nWe utilize forward loan sale contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in our mortgage loan pipeline and held-for-sale portfolio. Forward loan sale contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of mortgage loans. We agree to deliver on a specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. However, the contract may allow for cash settlement. The credit risk inherent to us arises from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. In the event of non-acceptance by the counterparty, we would be subject to the credit and inherent (or market) risk of the loans retained. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives and, along with related fees paid to investor are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. Fair value is based on the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the commitment at the reporting date.\nWe utilize two methods to deliver mortgage loans sold to an investor. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell the loan when an interest rate-lock commitment is entered into with a customer, as described above. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company is obligated to sell the mortgage loan to the investor only if the loan is closed and funded. Thus, the Company will not incur any liability to an investor if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. The Company also utilizes mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreements. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor should the Company fail to satisfy the contract. Mandatory commitments are recorded at fair value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of these commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line item Other noninterest income\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBusiness combinations and accounting for acquired loans with credit deterioration\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations\u201d ( ASC 805\u201d). Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of that date. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including any other identifiable intangible assets, exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Results of operations of acquired entities are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are considered to be Purchased Credit Deteriorated (\"PCD\"). The Company developed multiple criteria to assess the presence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration in acquired loans, mainly focused on changes in credit quality and payment status. While general criteria have been established, each acquisition will vary in its specific facts and circumstances and the Company will apply judgment around PCD identification for each individual acquisition based on their unique portfolio mix and risks identified.\nWe adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for loans previously classified as purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption and all PCI loans were transitioned to PCD loans upon adoption. Under PCD accounting,the amount of expected credit losses as of the acquisition date is added to the purchase price of the PCD loan. This establishes the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the PCD loan and the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan as of the acquisition date is the non-credit discount. Interest income for a PCD loan is recognized by accreting the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan to its contractual cash flows. The discount related to estimated credit losses on acquisition recorded as an allowance for credit losses will not be accreted into interest income. Only the noncredit-related discount will be accreted into interest income and subsequent adjustments to expected credit losses will flow through the provision for credit losses on the income statement.\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to\nloss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded, unless considered derivatives.\nFor loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives and when the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company, we apply the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss on off-balance-sheet commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit commitments is recognized as a liability. When the loan is funded, an allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for that loan using the CECL methodology, and the liability for off-balance-sheet commitments is reduced. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss, we consider the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions.", "item_7_truncated": "On March 22, 2020, a statement was issued by our banking regulators and

These modifications were consistent with the \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\" and the CARES Act and did not qualify as TDRs. As of December 31, 2020, the total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status amounted to $1.40 billion. As of December 31, 2020, recorded balances in total loans remaining in deferral status under this program amounted to $202.5 million. The payment deferrals program differs from forbearance, in that all deferred payments are not normally due at the end of the deferral period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced to a future time period. Generally, interest continues to accrue on loans during the deferral period, unless the loan is on nonaccrual. The vast majority of our loans in deferral status are considered performing loans, and we anticipate collecting on these balances. We remain proactive in monitoring our loans in deferral status by reaching out to our borrowers with payment deferrals to determine their financial capacity and whether additional payment deferrals or other loan modifications are necessary.\nWhen a company's ratios are in excess of one or both of these guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by management.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and Mortgage. See Note 21, Segment reporting\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these business segments.\nDue to state banking laws, the Bank may not declare dividends in any calendar year in an amount exceeding the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years, without the prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (\"TDFI\"). Based upon this regulation, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $185.7 million and $223.7 million of the Bank's retained earnings were available for the payment of dividends without such prior approval. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $48.8 million in cash dividends approved by the board for payment from the Bank to the holding company in addition to an asset dividend of an equity security amounting to $1.0 million. None of these required approval from the TDFI. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the board approved a dividend from the Bank to the holding company for $75.0 million that did not require approval from the TDFI. No dividends from the Bank to the Company were paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations\u201d ( ASC 805\u201d). Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of that date. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including any other identifiable intangible assets, exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Results of operations of acquired entities are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan type (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Pass </td> <td> </td> <td>Watch </td> <td> </td> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td>Doubtful(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,238,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,346,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>1,178,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,222,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-to-4 family mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td>1,025,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,089,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>396,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td>175,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>828,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>924,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,598,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td>294,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317,640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,586,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>364,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,082,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $9.46 billion and $4.93 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and are, at times, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve Board's actions. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur.\nReturn on equity and assets\nDevelopments in 2020\nWe evaluate available-for-sale securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, we consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan type (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Fixed\ninterest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Floating\ninterest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>543,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,120,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>534,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>809,848 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>609,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,464,133 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-to-4 family </td> <td> </td> <td>809,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,010,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>4,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>380,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family </td> <td> </td> <td>86,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169,385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>182,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>609,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td>267,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total ($) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,070,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,782,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,852,671 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (%) </td> <td> </td> <td>52.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)Includes $2.09 million of loan contractual interest and $3.92 million of loan fees related to PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNoninterest expense increased to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The Company also issued replacement restricted stock units to replace those initially granted by Franklin in 2020 that did not vest upon change in control, with a total fair value of $0.7 million attributed to pre-combination service. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $29.52 on August 15, 2020, the merger consideration represented approximately $477.8 million in aggregate consideration.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

profitability and growth are affected by the highly competitive nature of the financial services industry. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, online mortgage providers, internet banks and other financial institutions operating within the areas we serve, particularly with national and regional banks that often have more resources than we do to invest in growth and technology and community banks with strong local ties, all of which target the same clients we do. Recently, we have seen increased competitive pressures on loan rates.

the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in projected credit deterioration requiring us to recognize significant increases in the ACL. Specifically, we performed additional qualitative evaluations for certain categories within our loan portfolio, in line with our established qualitative framework, weighting the impact of the current economic outlook, status of federal government stimulus programs, and other considerations, in order to identify specific industries or borrowers seeing credit improvement or deterioration specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also increased the ACL by $82.1 million of which $77.7 million related to loans acquired on August 15, 2020, as part of the Franklin acquisition and $4.5 million related to loans acquired on February 14, 2020, as part of the Farmers National acquisition. Outside of the impact of Franklin on the provision for credit losses, the remaining loan portfolio benefited from improved economic forecasts, seen for the first time in 2020, reflective of the resumption of more normalized commercial activity within our markets.

have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020. Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Loans not considered nonperforming include loans 30-89 days past due amounting to $27.0 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2019. Periods prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 exclude purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") loans from nonperforming totals while the current period includes PCD loans at their contractual number of days past due. Loans in deferral status are considered current.\nOur noninterest income includes gains on sales of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of loans held for sale and derivatives, fees on mortgage loan originations, loan servicing fees, hedging results, fees generated from deposit services, investment services and trust income, gains and losses on securities, other real estate owned

Other noninterest expense increased $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $55.0 million compared to $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects costs associated with our growth, including the impact of our acquisitions, as well as a one-time prepayment penalty of $6.8 million, incurred in connection with our repayment of $150.0 million in long-term advances and $100.0 million in 90 day fixed rate advances.\nCOVID-19 and the CARES Act\nWe utilize forward loan sale contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in our mortgage loan pipeline and held-for-sale portfolio. Forward loan sale contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of mortgage loans. We agree to deliver on a specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. However, the contract may allow for cash settlement. The credit risk inherent to us arises from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. In the event of non-acceptance by the counterparty, we would be subject to the credit and inherent (or market) risk of the loans retained. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives and, along with related fees paid to investor are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income.

in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than the categories of loans disclosed in the table above. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified relative to industry concentrations across the various loan portfolio categories. While most industries have and are expected to continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of COVID-19, certain industries present more risk than others. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding loan principal balances of loans in deferral status amounted to $202.5 million.

Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. In addition to extending and amending the PPP, the HHSB Act also creates a new grant program for shuttered venue operators.\u201d As a participating lender in the PPP, the Company continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of total </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted average interest rate (%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturing Within: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>189,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses includes the use of lifetime loss rate models. The quantitative models require tailored loan data and macroeconomic variables based on the inherent credit risks in each portfolio to more accurately measure the credit risks associated with each. Each of the quantitative models pools loans with similar risk characteristics and collectively assesses the lifetime loss rate for each pool to estimate its expected credit loss. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in any given pool, the loan is individually assessed.\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2020, our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date (excluding interest). These contractual obligations are discussed in more detail within in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.\nThe allowance for credit losses is our best estimate. Actual losses may differ from the December 31, 2020 allowance for credit loss as the CECL estimate is sensitive to economic forecasts and management judgment.\nBusiness combinations and accounting for acquired loans with credit deterioration\nAdditional sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased, FHLB borrowings, and lines of credit. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Funds and advances obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. There were no outstanding overnight cash management advances (\"CMAs\") at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of our outstanding additional long-term advances with the FHLB were $0.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The remaining balance available with the FHLB was $1,176.1 million and $435.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit typically maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no borrowings against the lines at December 31, 2020 and at December 31, 2019.\nThe allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments increased to $16.4 million at December 31, 2020, and the deferred tax asset related to the ACL increased to $48.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe tables below present the components of the changes in net interest income for the the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volumes and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category.\nWe utilize derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company enters into swaps, interest rate cap and/or floor agreements with its customers and then enters into an offsetting derivative contract position with other financial institutions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts. Because these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.\nBanking regulators have established thresholds of less than 100% of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in construction lending and less than 300% of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in commercial real estate lending that management monitors as part of the risk management process. The construction concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding construction and land development loans to total tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. The commercial real estate concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and construction and land development loans to tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. Management strives to operate within the thresholds set forth above.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the increase in cost of funds partially offset by an increase in contractual loan yield earned on our loan portfolio.\nOur NIM, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% during the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.34% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a declining interest rate environment and change in balance sheet mix, partially attributable to our acquisition of Franklin during the year.\nResults of operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to enter any material capital expenditures over the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nWe enter into commitments to originate and purchase loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate-lock commitments). Rate-lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives. Accordingly, such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in other assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. Fair\nLoan categories\nAverage deposit balances by type, together with the average rates per period are reflected in the average balance sheet amounts, interest paid and rate analysis tables included in this management's discussion and analysis under the subheading \"Results of operations\" discussion.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $317.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $284.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $33.1 million. Interest income on loans held for investment, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $27.4 million to $278.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased loan volume driven by growth in average loan balances of $1.47 billion. The growth in average loan balance reflects the addition of $182.2 million in loans acquired from Farmers National and $2.43 billion in loans acquired in the Franklin merger. In addition, the origination of PPP loans during the period contributed $206.8 million to the increase in average total loans held for investment.\n(3)Includes investments in premises and equipment, other real estate owned, interest receivable, MSRs, core deposit and other intangibles, goodwill and other miscellaneous assets.\nThe efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. For an adjusted efficiency ratio, we exclude certain gains, losses and expenses we do not consider core to our business.\n(2) Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis.\n(7)Includes $0.4 million of accretion on subordinated debt fair value mark for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur total shareholders' equity was $1,291.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $762.3 million, at December 31, 2019. Book value per share was $27.35 at December 31, 2020 and $24.56 at December 31, 2019. The growth in shareholders' equity during 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in additional paid-in capital and common stock; a result of our acquisitive growth strategy through the merger with Franklin and the acquisition of Farmers National. Other changes in shareholders' equity were driven by earnings retention and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by a cumulative effective adjustment of $25.0 million on January 1, 2020 for the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and to a lesser extent, declared dividends and activity related to equity-based compensation.\nAs discussed above, the $27.4 million increase in interest income on loans held for investment during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was the primary driver of the $40.6 million increase in tax-equivalent net interest income. The increase in loan interest income was driven by an increase in average loans held for investment of $1.47 billion, or 35.5%, to $5.62 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely attributable to the acquisition of $182.2 million in loans from the Farmers National acquisition and $2.43 billion in loans from the Franklin merger plus an increase of $206.8 million in average PPP loans. The total decrease in interest expense of $7.5 million was primarily driven by decreases in rates on money market and customer time deposits partially offset by increase in volume, partially related to our acquisitions.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, interest rates fell to historic lows during the year ended December 31, 2020. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u2018\u2018FOMC'') reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. On March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve announced it would revive its quantitative easing program to provide liquidity to the U.S. treasury and mortgage markets by committing to buy $500 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $200 billion of agency mortgage backed securities. On March 16, 2020, the FOMC further reduced the target federal funds rate by an additional 100 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. On March 23, 2020 the Federal Reserve modified its quantitative easing program initiative to an unlimited purchase program that is expected to exceed the monetary policy support provided during the financial crisis over 10 years ago. These actions could have significant adverse effects on the earnings, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nWe did not record any provision for credit losses for its available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the majority of the investment portfolio is government guaranteed and declines in fair value below amortized cost were determined to be non-credit related.\nThe following table provides details of our nonperforming assets, the ratio of such loans and other nonperforming assets to total assets, and certain other related information as of the dates presented:\nNoninterest income amounted to $301.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $166.5 million, or 122.9%, as compared to $135.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest income in the above table are discussed below.\nAs a member of the FHLB Cincinnati, the Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various agreements that assist in funding its mortgage and loan portfolio balance sheet. Under the agreements, we pledge qualifying residential mortgages of $1,248.9 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $1,532.7 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $1,276.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we pledged qualifying residential mortgages of $413.0 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $545.5 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $760.6 million.\nThe following tables present the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Loans with scheduled maturities are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. Demand loans with no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported in the due in 1 year or less\u201d category. Loans that have adjustable rates are shown as amortizing to final maturity rather than when the interest rates are next subject to change. The tables do not include prepayment assumptions or scheduled repayments. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $22.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively, in fixed-rate loans in which the Company has entered into variable rate swap contracts.\n(3)Includes $1.0 million and $0.5 million of gain accretion from other comprehensive income from a previously cancelled cash flow hedge for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives and when the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company, we apply the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss on off-balance-sheet commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit commitments is recognized as a liability. When the loan is funded, an allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for that loan using the CECL methodology, and the liability for off-balance-sheet commitments is reduced. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss, we consider the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions.\nInterest expense was $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $7.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver was the impact of the decrease in interest rates on deposits, resulting in total deposit interest expense decrease of $8.7 million to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was largely attributed to money market deposits which decreased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and customer time deposits which decreased to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate on money markets decreased to 0.76%, down 66 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. Average money market balances increased $587.8 million to $1,807.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,219.7 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease in interest expense on customer time deposits was primarily driven by decreased interest rates as the average rate on customer time deposits decreased 57 basis points from 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.52% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of deposits was 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.10% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe components of mortgage banking income for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nMortgage loans held for sale were $683.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $262.5 million at December 31, 2019. Interest rate lock volume for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $8.94 billion and $5.90 billion, respectively. Generally, mortgage volume increases in lower interest rate environments and robust housing markets and decreases in rising interest rate environments and slower housing markets. The increase in interest rate lock volume for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects the increased volume in our retail and ConsumerDirect channels, which benefited from the lower interest rate environment when compared to the previous year. Interest rate lock commitments in the pipeline were $1.19 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $453.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category as well as the ratio of loans by loan category compared to the total loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we determined that all available-for-sale debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses recognized on available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome from mortgage servicing of $22.1 million and $17.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was offset by declines in fair value of MSRs and related hedging activity of $34.4 million and $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAllowance for credit losses\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.4% and 67.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 59.2% and 65.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in this Report for a discussion of the adjusted efficiency ratio.\n\nAverage balance sheet amounts, interest earned and yield analysis\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and access to funding sources. To date, we have not seen significant pressure on liquidity or sources of funding as a result of COVID-19 and have maintained higher than typical levels of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents to allow for flexibility.\n\nFinancial condition\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized significant increases in our provision for credit losses and merger costs, which resulted in return on average total assets of 0.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average shareholders' equity was 6.58% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs described further under Business: Supervision and regulation,\u201d we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in the \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" and Risk Factors\" sections of this Annual Report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nFinancial condition\nOur net income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $63.6 million from $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.67 and $2.65 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net income represented a ROAA of 0.75% and 1.45% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ROAE of 6.58% and 11.6% for the same periods. Our ratio of ROATCE for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 8.54% and 15.4%, respectively.\nMortgage\nWe operate through two segments, Banking and Mortgage. We generate most of our revenue in our Banking segment from interest on loans and investments, loan-related fees, mortgage originations from mortgage offices within our banking footprint, trust and investment services and deposit-related fees. Our primary source of funding for our loans is customer deposits, and, to a lesser extent, unsecured credit lines, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances, brokered and internet deposits, and other borrowings. We generate most of our revenue in our Mortgage segment from origination fees and gains on sales in the secondary market of mortgage loans that we originate from our mortgage offices outside our Banking footprint and through our online ConsumerDirect channel, as well as from mortgage servicing revenues.\nDeposits and investment securities available for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, we may also obtain advances from the FHLB, purchase federal funds and engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve, correspondent banks, or enter into client repurchase agreements. We also use these sources of funds as part of our asset liability management process to control our long-term interest rate risk exposure, even if it may increase our short-term cost of funds.\nWe enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements are made to provide customers with comprehensive treasury management programs a short-term return for their excess funds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $32.2 million and $23.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for loans previously classified as purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption and all PCI loans were transitioned to PCD loans upon adoption. Under PCD accounting,the amount of expected credit losses as of the acquisition date is added to the purchase price of the PCD loan. This establishes the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the PCD loan and the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan as of the acquisition date is the non-credit discount. Interest income for a PCD loan is recognized by accreting the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan to its contractual cash flows. The discount related to estimated credit losses on acquisition recorded as an allowance for credit losses will not be accreted into interest income. Only the noncredit-related discount will be accreted into interest income and subsequent adjustments to expected credit losses will flow through the provision for credit losses on the income statement.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within fifteen to twenty-five days after the loan is funded, depending on the economic environment and competition in the market. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nWe enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are recorded as other comprehensive income and are subsequently recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. The assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method.\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $94.6 million as compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The steep increase in provision for credit losses was primarily the result of conforming the acquired loan portfolios to comply with CECL under our established framework and governance model, as CECL requires the establishment of an allowance for credit losses for non-purchased credit deteriorated loans be recognized through the provision for credit losses on the acquisition date. In addition to the impact of the acquired portfolios during the year, our provision for credit losses was impacted by declining economic forecasts resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Farmers National acquisition on February 14, 2020 amounted to $2.9 million while the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Franklin merger on August 15, 2020 amounted to $52.8 million. The remaining $38.9 million included in the provision for credit losses is reflective of activity for both the Company's legacy non-acquired portfolios and the acquired portfolios of Farmers National and Franklin from their respective acquisition dates through the remainder of 2020. Although the portfolio benefited from improving economic forecasts in the last half of 2020, there is much uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to lead to increased volatility in forecasted macroeconomic variables, a key input to our calculated level of allowance for credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, our policy for the allowance for credit losses changed with the adoption of CECL. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adopting CECL, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nMortgage loans held for sale\nSubordinated debt\nCommercial and industrial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. Our commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital and operating needs and business expansions, including the purchase of capital equipment and loans made to farmers relating to their operations. This category also includes loans secured by manufactured housing receivables. Commercial and industrial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. This category also includes the loans we originated as part of the PPP, established by the CARES Act. The PPP is administered by the SBA, and loans we originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules. These federally guaranteed loans were intended to provide up to 24 weeks of payroll and other operating costs as a source of aid to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are generally made with operating cash flows as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and personal guarantees. We plan to continue to make commercial and industrial loans an area of emphasis in our lending operations in the future. Excluding PPP loans totaling $212.6 million as of December 31, 2020, our commercial and industrial loans comprised $1,133.5 million, or 16% of our loans held for investment.\nFor additional information regarding our interest rate risks factors and management, see Business: Risk management: Liquidity and interest rate risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\n\nFor loans due after one year or more, the following tables present the sensitivities to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to $265.7 million compared with $226.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest income includes the amortization and accretion of purchase premium and discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method anticipating prepayments based upon the prior three month average monthly prepayments when available. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied loans. Our commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate non-owner occupied investment properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, health care facilities, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial, manufactured housing communities, retail centers, multifamily properties, assisted living facilities and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale of the completed property or rental proceeds from such property, and are therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market, which can also be affected by general economic conditions.\nOverview of recent financial performance\nRate/volume analysis\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 health pandemic created a crisis resulting in volatility in financial markets, sudden, unprecedented job losses, and disruption in consumer and commercial behavior, resulting in governments in the United States and globally to intervene with varying levels of direct monetary support and fiscal stimulus packages. All industries, municipalities and consumers have been impacted by the health crisis to some degree, including the markets that we serve. In attempts to flatten the curve\u201d, businesses not deemed essential were closed or constrained to capacity limitations, individuals were asked to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses, leading to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, widening of credit spreads, dislocation of bond markets, disruption of global supply chains and changes in consumer spending behavior. As certain restrictions began lifting and more businesses were allowed to open their doors in late 2020, we began to experience a slow improvement in commerce through much of our footprint. Despite the pickup in economic activity late in the year, there is uncertainty regarding the long term effects on the global economy which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nTotal assets\nThe following table summarizes activity in our allowance for credit losses during the periods indicated:\nMortgage servicing rights\n(1)Calculated using daily averages.\nFair Value Measurements\nIncome before taxes from the Mortgage segment increased to $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased volume driven by declining interest rates and an increase in refinancing activity. The increase in volume contributed to noninterest income increasing $109.4 million to $179.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company obtained a line of credit for $20.0 million, of which $15.0 million was borrowed to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National acquisition.\nLoan portfolio\n(1) Average loans are gross, including nonaccrual loans and overdrafts (before deduction of allowance for loan losses). Loan fees of $13.0 million and $13.1 million, accretion of $8.6 million and $7.6 million, nonaccrual interest collections of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, and syndicated loan fee income of $0.2 million and $0.4 million are included in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $84.2 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included $5.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of excess land and facilities held for sale resulting from our acquisitions. Other nonperforming assets, including other repossessed non-real estate, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 amounted to $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank's mortgage operations had sales of $6.24 billion which generated a gain on sales margin of 3.79%. This compares to $4.55 billion and 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gain on sales margin is a result of the mortgage restructuring in 2019, and productive market conditions in 2020. The industry benefited greatly from declining interest rates in 2020, causing a sharp increase in volume in 2020. Mortgage banking income from gains on sale and related fair value changes increased to $267.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total interest rate lock volume increased $3,036.0 million, or 51.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. The volume mix of refinances and purchases also shifted during year ended December 31, 2020 to 77.6% refinance volume compared with 56.2% during the previous year.\nOn August 15, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. The loans had an acquisition date fair value of $326.2 million, which declined to $215.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to loans within the portfolio being paid off through external refinancing. This decrease is also partially offset by a change in fair value after acquisition amounting to a gain of $3.2 million, which is included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nDeposits\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. We determine the appropriateness of the allowance through periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters. See \"Critical accounting policies - Allowance for credit losses\" for additional information regarding our methodology.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and general practices within the banking industry. Within our financial statements, certain financial information contain approximate measurements of financial effects of transactions and impacts at the consolidated balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards and subsequent adoptions, are discussed in further detail in \"Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" of this Report.\nNoninterest expense increased to $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $223.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018. The increase in noninterest expense reflects the impact of our acquisition of the Branches, including increases in salaries, commissions and personnel-related costs and increased merger expenses. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 also reflects expenses of $2.0 million related to the sale of our wholesale mortgage origination channels comprising the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent origination channels (collectively referred to as \"mortgage restructuring\").\nNonperforming assets\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio segregated into fixed and floating interest rate loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to\nMortgage banking income attributable to our Banking segment from retail operations within the Bank footprint was $75.4 million and $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and mortgage banking income attributable to our Mortgage segment was $179.9 million and $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe following table sets forth the distribution by type of our deposit accounts for the dates indicated:\nCritical accounting policies\nBeginning January 1, 2020, loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are considered to be Purchased Credit Deteriorated (\"PCD\"). The Company developed multiple criteria to assess the presence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration in acquired loans, mainly focused on changes in credit quality and payment status. While general criteria have been established, each acquisition will vary in its specific facts and circumstances and the Company will apply judgment around PCD identification for each individual acquisition based on their unique portfolio mix and risks identified.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, influenced by declining interest rates during the current period.\n\nThe following table sets forth the fair value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated below:\nThe table below shows concentration ratios for the Bank and Company as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, which both were within the stated thresholds.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale and their approximate fair values as of the dates shown:\nOverall Objective\nAccretion on purchased loans contributed 5 and 16 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in accretion is due in part to the adoption of CECL and purchase accounting resulting from our merger with Franklin, that contributed a net premium of $11.3 million recorded as of August 15, 2020, to be amortized as a reduction to loan interest income. Contractual interest and origination fees on PPP loans attributed 8 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020. We anticipate recognizing an estimated $2.7 million in deferred origination fees, net of third party costs and deferred salaries, over the remaining life of the PPP loan portfolio.\nEfficiency ratio\nAs of January 1, 2020, our policy for the allowance changed with the adoption of CECL to a lifetime expected credit loss approach. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adoption, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nLoans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, primarily mortgage loans, are carried at fair value as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC 825\u201d). Net gains (losses) resulting from fair value changes of these mortgage loans are recorded in income. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both mortgage loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in Mortgage banking income\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses are recognized in Mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income at the time the loan is closed. Pass through origination costs and related loan fees are also included in Mortgage banking income\u201d. Other expenses are classified in the appropriate noninterest expense accounts. Periodically, we will transfer mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary markets into the loan portfolio based on current market conditions, the overall secondary marketability of the loan and the status of the loan. The loans are transferred into the portfolio at fair value at the date of transfer.\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest, when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Beginning January 1, 2020, unrealized losses resulting from credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings as a provision for credit losses. Unrealized losses that do not result from credit losses are excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, which is included in equity. Accrued interest receivable is separated from other components of amortized cost and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $108.0 million under the current expected credit loss methodology compared with $7.1 million under the previous incurred loss model. Our provision was comprised of $94.6 million related to provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and $13.4 million related to provision for unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was greatly impacted by negative economic forecasts in our loss rate allowance for credit losses model promulgated by the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Economic forecasts slowly improved in the last half of 2020, however we believe the true impact of the pandemic on our loan portfolio could lag beyond the economic turnaround as borrower assistance programs are exhausted. While we continue to be sensitive to credit quality risks in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loan portfolios due to our concentration of loans in these categories, we believe our portfolio is well balanced overall. Although we have not experienced significant credit losses to date, we continue to closely monitor industries that present elevated risk of adverse impact. As of December 31, 2020, loans within these industries we consider \"of concern\" amounted to approximately 23.8% of our total loans held for investment. Additional detail summarizing our exposure to industries \"of concern\" is further discussed under the \"Financial Condition\" subheading within this management's discussion and analysis.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans include consumer loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans are generally secured by vehicles and other household goods. The collateral securing consumer loans may depreciate over time. The company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards. Other loans also include loans to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. These loans are generally subject to the risk that the borrowing municipality or political subdivision may lose a significant portion of its tax base or that the project for which the loan was made may produce inadequate revenue. None of these categories of loans represents a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nThe OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC (collectively, \"the Agencies\") initially provided an option within the regulatory capital framework to limit the initial regulatory \"day one\" adverse impact by allowing a three-year phase in period for said impact. In March 2020, the Agencies subsequently announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). We elected the five-year capital transition relief option.\nResults of operations\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\n(1) Minimum ratios presented exclude the capital conservation buffer.\nFranklin Financial Network, Inc.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), a nearly $670 billion program, as amended, designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee up to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs, including rent and other operating costs, to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to continue paying bills. Over the course of 2020, we originated over 2,900 PPP loans, with $314,678 in total balances through the US Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). The SBA began accepting PPP forgiveness applications in the last quarter of 2020, which decreased total balances to $212,645 as of December 31, 2020. Balances will continue to decline throughout 2021 as the SBA continues accepting forgiveness applications.\nInterest rates\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of FNB Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmers National Bank of Scottsville (collectively, \"Farmers National\"). Following the acquisition, Farmers National was merged into the Company with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. The Company acquired total assets of $258.2 million, loans of $182.2 million and deposits of $209.5 million. The consideration is valued at approximately $50.0 million based on 954,797 shares of the Company's common stock (utilizing the Company's market price of $36.70 on February 14, 2020) and $15.0 million in cash consideration. The acquisition resulted in $6.3 million of goodwill.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the classifications set forth in the following table. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we exceeded all capital ratio requirements under prompt corrective action and other regulatory requirements, as detailed in the table below:\nCompetition\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of 2020, we placed $100.0 million of ten year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, maturing September 1, 2030. This subordinated note instrument pays interest semi-annually in arrears based on a 4.5% fixed annual interest rate for the first five years of the notes. For years six through ten, the interest rate resets on a quarterly basis, and will be based on the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a spread of 439 basis points. We are entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after September 1, 2025. The Company has classified the issuance, net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,772, as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\nIncome taxes\nOverview\nBrokered and internet time deposits at December 31, 2020 increased by $41.2 million to $61.6 million compared with $20.4 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was the result of assuming Franklin's brokered and internet time deposits, totaling $107.5 million at August 15, 2020; this balance has declined since acquisition through continued overall balance sheet management as we continue to replace brokered and internet time deposits with less costly funding sources.\nMerger costs amounted to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, merger costs consisted of $7.7 million of contract termination costs, $5.6 million of branch closing and consolidation costs, $7.7 million of professional fees, $6.6 million of severance and separation benefits, $4.5 million of conversion-related costs, and $2.7 million of other acquisition-related costs. Costs during the previous year were related to our acquisition of the Branches, which closed during the second quarter of the previous year. We anticipate to continue incurring severance and separation benefits through the first half of 2021 for certain merger-related employment agreements.\n\nContractual obligations\n\nThe Company accounts for its mortgage servicing rights under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 860-50-35, \"Transfers and Servicing\". The Company retains the right to service certain mortgage loans that it sells to secondary market investors. The retained mortgage servicing right is initially recorded at the fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors. These mortgage servicing rights are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold.\nand Farmers National during year ended December 31, 2020 compared with merger expenses of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of the Branches.\nThe following table shows the carrying value of our total securities available for sale by investment type and the relative percentage of each investment type for the dates indicated:\n\nConstruction loans. Our construction loans include commercial construction, land acquisition and land development loans and single-family interim construction loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals. These loans are generally secured by the land or the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis. We expect to continue to make construction loans at a similar pace so long as demand continues and the market for and values of such properties remain stable or continue to improve in our markets. These loans can carry risk of repayment when projects incur cost overruns, have an increase in the price of building materials, encounter zoning and environmental issues, or encounter other factors that may affect the completion of a project on time and on budget. Additionally, repayment risk may be negatively impacted when the market experiences a deterioration in the value of real estate.\nSalaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expenses representing 62.0% and 62.1% of total noninterest expense in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $81.7 million, or 53.7%, to $233.8 million as compared to $152.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly driven by our increase in headcount as a result of our mergers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, FTE's increased to 1,852 as of December 31, 2020 from 1,377 as of December 31, 2019. Also included in total salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was an increase of $41.8 million in commissions and incentives expenses resulting from increased mortgage production previously discussed.\nThe components of our loan yield, a key driver to our NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. Changes in fair value from the acquisition date fair value are included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nOur capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the TDFI, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe table below shows the average balances, income and expense and yield and rates of each of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis, if applicable, for the periods indicated.\nNon-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19\nLoans held for sale\nOur total assets were $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to total assets of $6.12 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to our acquisition of Farmers National, completed on February 14, 2020 and merger with Franklin on August 15, 2020, which added assets of $258.2 million and $3.63 billion, respectively, combined with our participation in the PPP. Additionally, the increase is partially related to the $212.6 million of outstanding PPP loans at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.32 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.09 billion during the year 2020, up from $232.7 million at December 31, 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure adequate liquidity.\nNoninterest expense increased by $132.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $377.1 million as compared to $244.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest expense in the above table are discussed below.\nShareholders' equity\nIncome before taxes from the Banking segment decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $5.9 million, compared to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These results were primarily driven by the provisions for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments totaling $108.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $7.1 million in the previous year. Net interest income increased $39.5 million to $265.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $226.1 million in the same period in the prior year. Noninterest income increased to $122.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $64.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Noninterest expense increased $96.8 million, primarily due to merger and other costs associated with our overall growth, including increased salaries, commissions and employee benefits expenses associated with incremental headcount following our acquisitions. Results of our Banking Segment also include mortgage retail footprint pre-tax net contribution of $26.4 million and $7.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nWe have numerous customers that have experienced financial distress, as a direct result of COVID-19, and in response we introduced a payment deferral program to assist during these unprecedented times. The total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status was $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2020. We had a recorded investment in loans remaining on Company-sponsored deferred payment programs totaling $202.5 million as of December 31, 2020 , representing approximately 2.9% of our loans held for investment. Of the loans granted deferrals, these modifications typically range between sixty to ninety days and were not considered TDRs under the interagency regulatory guidance or the CARES Act. Additionally, we service mortgages on behalf of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, and as of December 31, 2020 approximately 6% of customers serviced on behalf of the aforementioned companies have received forbearance assistance. COVID-19 is expected to continue to influence commerce worldwide and the magnitude to which our financial results will be impacted is uncertain at this time.\nThe fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 was $1,172.4 million compared to $688.4 million at December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we purchased $425.0 million (excluding those acquired from Farmers National and merged from Franklin) and $151.4 million in investment securities, respectively. The trade value of securities sold was $146.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The trade value of securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $24.5 million, respectively. Maturities and calls of securities totaled $220.5 million and $113.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net unrealized gains of $34.6 million and $11.7 million, respectively, were unrealized on available-for-sale debt securities.\nAs part of our liquidity management strategy, we also focus on minimizing our costs of liquidity and attempt to decrease these costs by growing our noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits, while replacing higher cost funding sources including time deposits and borrowed funds. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer.\n(5)The NIM is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, by average total earning assets.\nthe respective fifth anniversary of each note issuance. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the issuance that we intend to exercise our rights to redeem the $40.0 million note in full during the first quarter of 2021. We classified the entire $60,000 in subordinated notes as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\ndual mandate of full employment and stable prices. The FOMC maintained the Federal Funds rate to zero lower bound, and maintained their commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. During the last half of 2020, the US Treasury yield curve steepened as long-term rates rose. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to continue having a negative impact on net interest income. Other financial impacts could occur, though such potential impacts are unknown at this time.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year ended December 31, 2018\nDuring 2020, our percentage of total nonperforming loans to loans held for investment increased to 0.91% as of December 31, 2020, from 0.60% at December 31, 2019. Our loans classified as substandard and doubtful increased to 1.87% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2020, compared to 1.82% as of December 31, 2019. Our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 were $84.2 million, or 0.75% of total assets, increasing from $47.1 million, or 0.77% of assets as of December 31, 2019.\nThere were no borrowings against the line as of December 31, 2020, while borrowings against the line totaled $250.0 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no FHLB advances as of December 31, 2020, while FHLB advances as of December 31, 2019 includes two long-term advances with putable features totaling $150.0 million. These two long-term advances of $100.0 million and $50.0 million carry maximum final terms of 10 years and 7 years, respectively. However, the FHLB owns the option to cancel the advances after one year and quarterly thereafter at predetermined fixed rates of 1.24% and 1.37%, respectively These putable advances were paid off in the fourth quarter of 2020 at a penalty of $4.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. There were no overnight cash management advances (CMAs) outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Letters of credit with FHLB of $100.0 million and $75.0 million were pledged to secure public funds that required collateral as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no 90-day fixed-rate advances were included in total FHLB advances. The maximum amount of FHLB borrowing outstanding at any month end was $250.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted average interest rate on FHLB borrowings was 0.00% and 1.51% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nKey factors affecting our business\nNet interest income is the largest contributor to our net income and is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board and market interest rates.\nWe have two wholly-owned subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts ( Trusts\u201d). The Trusts were created for the sole purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities to fund the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our $0.9 million investment in the Trusts was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and our $30.0 million obligation is reflected as junior subordinated debt, respectively. The junior subordinated debt bears interest at floating interest rates based on a spread over 3-month LIBOR plus 315 basis points (3.40% and 5.10% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the $21.7 million debenture and 3-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points (3.50% and 5.19% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the remaining $9.3 million. The $9.3 million debenture may be redeemed prior to the 2033 maturity date upon the occurrence of a special event, and the $21.7 million debenture may be redeemed prior to 2033 at our option.\nRegulatory trends and changes in laws\nIncluded in noninterest-bearing deposits are certain mortgage escrow and related customer deposits that our third-party servicing provider, Cenlar, transfers to the Bank which totaled $148.0 million and $92.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally, our deposits from municipal and governmental entities (i.e. \"public deposits\") totaled $1,677.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $463.1 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nHowever, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. If we determine a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale investment security has resulted from credit related factors, beginning January 1, 2020 with the adoption of CECL, we record a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the impairment related to other, non-credit related, factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe Bank maintains lines with certain correspondent banks that provide borrowing capacity in the form of federal funds purchased in the aggregate amount of $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no borrowings against the line at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nU.S. Basel III measures capital strength in three tiers and incorporates risk-adjusted assets to determine the risk-based capital ratios. Our CET1 capital primarily includes shareholders' equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangibles, net of taxes, net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities and derivative instruments, net of tax. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital and included junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $30.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Tier 2 capital components include a portion of the allowance for credit losses in excess of Tier 1 statutory limits and our remaining combined trust preferred security debt issuances.\nFNB Financial Corp. merger\nCosts resulting from our equity compensation grants during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $10.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively. These grants comprise restricted stock units granted to all new full-time associates each year in addition to annual performance grants, employment agreement grants and grants resulting from acquisition. Additionally, during 2020 we began granting performance-based stock units, which resulted in $1.0 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition compares balances as of December 31, 2020 with December 31, 2019.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor additional information, see Business: Our markets,\u201d Business: Competition\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\nBank liquidity management\nHolding company liquidity management\nLoans by type\nThe following table sets forth our total borrowings segmented by years to maturity as of December 31, 2020:\n\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which in accordance with GAAP, are not included as part of our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit, and commitments to purchase loans, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 17, \"Commitments and contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\n\nextends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators' views on consumer protection considerations.\nCommercial loans held for sale\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe change in accounting estimate as a result of our adoption of CECL increased the ACL as of January 1, 2020 to $62.6 million from the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 of $31.1 million. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $25.0 million, with corresponding adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments in addition to recording a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Included in our transition adjustment as of January 1, 2020 was the cumulative effect adjustment to gross-up the amortized cost amount of purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans by $0.6 million.\nWe utilize two methods to deliver mortgage loans sold to an investor. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell the loan when an interest rate-lock commitment is entered into with a customer, as described above. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company is obligated to sell the mortgage loan to the investor only if the loan is closed and funded. Thus, the Company will not incur any liability to an investor if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. The Company also utilizes mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreements. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor should the Company fail to satisfy the contract. Mandatory commitments are recorded at fair value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of these commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line item Other noninterest income\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMortgage banking income primarily includes origination fees and realized gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of mortgage loans and derivatives, and mortgage servicing fees, which includes net change in fair value of MSRs and related derivatives. Mortgage banking income is initially driven by the recognition of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) at fair value at inception of the IRLCs. This is subsequently adjusted for changes in the overall interest rate environment offset by derivative contracts entered into to mitigate the interest rate exposure. Upon sale of the loan, the net fair value gain is reclassified as a realized gain on sale. Mortgage banking income was $255.3 million and $100.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a 153.0% increase year-over-year.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $4.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in equity securities recorded at fair value that primarily consisted of mutual funds. The change in the fair value of equity securities resulted in a net gain of $296.5 thousand and $148.0 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n\nIn order to operate with a sound risk profile, we focus on originating loans that we believe to be of high quality. We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions, including extensions or interest rate modifications, to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans, which can result in us carrying higher nonperforming assets. We believe this practice leads to higher recoveries in the long-term.\nOther real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in addition to excess facilities held for sale. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Reductions in the carrying value subsequent to foreclosure are charged to earnings and are included in Gain on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2020, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $1.8 million, which combined with gains on sales of other real estate, resulted in net losses of $1.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $0.5 million, which combined with net gains on sales of other real estate owned, resulted in a net gain $0.5 million.\nThroughout the following discussion of our operating results, we present our net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis. The fully tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, which enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we initiated a credit line in the amount of $20.0 million (1.75% + 1 month LIBOR in effect 2 business days prior to reprice date) and borrowed $15.0 million against the line to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National transaction. An additional $5.0 million remains available for the Company to draw. This line of credit has a term of one year and matured subsequent to December 31, 2020 on February 21, 2021.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters.\nNoninterest expense\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $151.2 million and $51.7 million of delinquent GNMA loans that had previously been sold; however, we determined there not to be a more-than-trivial benefit of rebooking based on an analysis of interest rates and an assessment of potential reputational risk associated with these loans. As such, these were not recorded on our balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nSee the section captioned \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" for more information regarding the Company's ACL methodology.\nWe continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits.\nCommercial real estate owner-occupied loans. Our commercial real estate owner-occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate owner occupied properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, production facilities, health care facilities, retail centers, restaurants, churches and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower, and hence are dependent on the success of the underlying business for repayment and are more exposed to general economic conditions.\n(1)Includes $212,645 of loans originated as part of the PPP at December 31, 2020, established by the CARES Act, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is administered by the SBA; loans originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules.\nSee also Risk factors: Legal, regulatory and compliance risk\u201d.\nResidential line of credit loans. Our residential line of credit loans are primarily revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential properties. We intend to continue to make residential line of credit loans if housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. Residential line of credit loans may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nAdditionally, the Bank maintains a line with the Federal Reserve Bank through the Borrower-in-Custody program. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $2.46 billion and $1.41 billion of qualifying loans and $0.0 million and $5.0 million of investment securities were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank, securing a line of credit of $1,695.6 million and $1,013.2 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared and paid dividends of 0.36 per share, or $14.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared and paid dividends of $0.32 per share, or $10.2 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.11 per share, payable on February 22, 2021, to stockholders of record as of February 8, 2021.\nThe provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") at an appropriate level under the current expected credit loss model. The determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. We adopted the expected credit loss methodology under FASB ASC Topic 326 on January 1, 2020. The change in methodology from the previous incurred loss model in place prior to adoption requires additional inputs and the use of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to estimate loan losses for the entire life of the loan portfolio. As such, the results between models are not necessarily comparable. Refer to Note 1, \"Basis of presentation\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion regarding ACL methodology.\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. We continue to focus on growing core customer deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy, community-focused marketing programs, and initiatives such as the development of our treasury management services.\nResidential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. Our residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, including manufactured homes with real estate, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. We intend to continue to make residential 1-4 family housing loans at a similar pace, so long as housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. First lien residential 1-4 family mortgages may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nExcluding the impact of our merger and acquisition activities, as well as the PPP loans included in loans held for investment, total assets increased 16.0%, total loans decreased 3.4%, and total deposits increased 24.2%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company's ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see the Item 1. Business - Supervision and regulation,\u201d \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks related to our business\" and \" Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy,\" each of which is set forth in our Annual Report.\nOur investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, securities with a carrying value of $804.8 million and $373.7 million, respectively, were pledged to secure government, public, trust and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings, letters of credit and derivative instruments. Additionally, we have a FHLB letter of credit to secure public funds totaling $100.0 million and $75.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are a financial holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. We operate primarily through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, FirstBank, the third largest bank headquartered in Tennessee, based on total assets. FirstBank provides a comprehensive suite of commercial and consumer banking services to clients in select markets in Tennessee, North Alabama, Southern Kentucky, and North Georgia. As of December 31, 2020, our footprint included 81 full-service branches serving the following Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Areas ( MSAs\u201d): Nashville, Chattanooga (including North Georgia), Knoxville, Memphis, and Jackson in addition to Bowling Green, Kentucky and Florence and Huntsville, Alabama. We also provide banking services to 16 community markets throughout Tennessee and North Georgia. FirstBank also provides mortgage banking services utilizing its bank branch network and mortgage banking offices strategically located throughout the southeastern United States in addition to a national internet delivery channel. As of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $11.21 billion, loans held for investment of $7.08 billion, total deposits of $9.46 billion, and total shareholders' equity of $1.29 billion.\nWhen credit losses are expected to occur, the amount of the expected credit loss recognized in earnings depends on our intention to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the expected credit loss recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the date it was determined to be impaired due to credit losses or other factors. The previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.\n\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing and was the original transferor. At the servicer's option and without GNMA's prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100 percent of the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing,\u201d this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When we are deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans held for investment, regardless of whether we intend to exercise the buy-back option if the buyback option provides the transferor a more-than-trivial benefit. When repurchased, after meeting certain performance criteria, the loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value and are able to be repooled into a new Ginnie Mae guaranteed security.\nOur noninterest expense includes primarily salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense, legal and professional fees, data processing expense, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, advertising and promotion and other real estate owned expense, among others. We monitor the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, which is commonly known as the efficiency ratio.\nThe principal categories of our loans held for investment portfolio are discussed below:\nLoans held for sale\nOur loan portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 63.2% and 72.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. Our overall lending approach is primarily focused on providing credit to our customers directly rather than purchasing loan syndications and loan participations from other banks (collectively, participated loans\u201d). At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans held for investment included approximately $206.8 million and $103.4 million, respectively, related to purchased participation loans. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations.\n(4)Includes $0.4 million accretion on subordinated debt fair value premium for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $170.4 million and $31.1 million and represented 2.41% and 0.71% of loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Excluding PPP loans with a recorded investment totaling $212.6 million, our ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment would have been 7 basis points higher\n(1) This category was added in 2020. Loans considered \"Doubtful\" were included as part of the \"Substandard\" risk category prior to January 1, 2020.\nThe adjustment to convert certain income to a tax-equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and blended state statutory income tax rate of 26.06% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe consider the need to qualitatively adjust our modeled quantitative expected credit loss estimate for information not already captured in the model loss estimation process. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease our estimate of expected credit losses. We review the qualitative adjustments so as to validate that information that has already been considered and included in the modeled quantitative loss estimation process is not also included in the qualitative adjustment. We consider the qualitative factors that are relevant to the institution as of the reporting date, which may include, but are not limited to: levels of and trends in delinquencies and performance of loans; levels of and trends in write-offs and recoveries collected; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in reasonable and supportable economic forecasts; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; available relevant information sources that contradict our own forecast; effects of changes in prepayment expectations or other factors affecting assessments of loan contractual term; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.\n\nITEM 7 - Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nloss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded, unless considered derivatives.\nOur deposit base also includes certain commercial and high net worth individuals that periodically place deposits with the Bank for short periods of time and can cause fluctuations from period to period in the overall level of customer deposits outstanding. These fluctuations may include certain deposits from related parties as disclosed within Note 25, \"Related party transactions\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Management continues to focus on growing noninterest-bearing deposits while allowing more costly funding sources to mature, repricing downward in our current lower interest rate conditions.\nEquity securities with readily determinable market values are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with any periodic changes in value made through adjustments to the statement of income. Equity securities without readily determinable market values are carried at cost less impairment and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAsset quality\n(4)Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a U.S. federal income tax rate and, where applicable, state income tax to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table were $2.8 million, $1.9 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.\nIn connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate expected credit loss, the Company considers the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions. As such, the Company recorded provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor additional information regarding credit quality risk factors for our Company, see Business: Risk management: Credit risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Credit Risks.\u201d\nDiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in the respective sections within \"Part II. Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of operations\" of our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCapital management and regulatory capital requirements\nThe following table sets forth the balance and associated percentage of each class of financing receivable in our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nThe tax-equivalent yield on loans held for investment was 4.95%, down 109 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in yield was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and was also impacted by lower-yielding PPP loans originated during the period. Contractual loan interest rates yielded 4.57% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 5.50% in the year ended December 31, 2019. PPP loans contribute 14 basis points of this decline in contractual loan yield.\nThe following table sets forth our time deposits segmented by months to maturity and deposit amount as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and other miscellaneous non-earning assets. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. In our loan review process, we seek to identify and proactively address nonperforming loans.\nInvestment securities\nWe are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk Policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements and otherwise sustain our operations. We accomplish this through management of the maturities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs.\nOur investment portfolio objectives include maximizing total return after other primary objectives are achieved such as, but not limited to, providing liquidity, capital preservation, and pledging collateral for various types of borrowings. The investment objectives guide the portfolio allocation among securities types, maturities, and other attributes.\nWe focus on originating quality loans and have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in upholding the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. However, credit trends in the markets in which we operate and in our loan portfolio can materially impact our financial condition and performance and are primarily driven by the economic conditions in our markets.\n\nThe following table sets forth our ROAA, ROAE, dividend payout ratio and average shareholders' equity to average assets ratio for the periods indicated:\nWe utilize probability-weighted forecasts, which consider multiple macroeconomic variables from a third-party vendor that are applicable to the type of loan. The choice and weighting of the economic forecast scenarios, macroeconomic variables, and the reasonable and supportable period at the macroeconomic variable-level are reviewed and approved by the forecast governance committee based on expectations of future economic conditions.\nThe transaction added a new subsidiary to the Company, FirstBank Risk Management (\"FBRM\"), which provides risk management services to the Company in the form of enhanced insurance coverages. It also added a new subsidiary to the Bank, FirstBank Investments of Tennessee, Inc. (\"FBIT\"), which provides investment services to the Bank. FBIT has a wholly owned subsidiary, FirstBank Investments of Nevada, Inc. (\"FBIN\") to provide investment services to FBIT. FBIN has a controlling interest in a subsidiary, FirstBank Preferred Capital, Inc. (\"FBPC\"), which serves as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), to allow the Bank to sell real estate loans to the REIT to obtain a tax benefit.\n\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $103.4 million and $68.0 million, respectively. This increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 is mainly attributable to a continued increase in business activity and the result of a conducive interest rate environment for refinancing during the period, which led to an increase in related commissions and incentives expenses.\n\nNoninterest income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, generally comprising over 50% of our total revenues in a given period. Net interest income and margin are shaped by many factors, primarily the volume, term structure and mix of earning assets, funding mechanisms, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In response to economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve remains committed to using all available tools to support the economy and uphold their\nOur total assets grew by 83.0% to $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.12 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects additions through acquisitions amounting to $3.63 billion and $258.2 million from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, which closed on August 15, 2020 and February 14, 2020, respectively. Loans held for investment increased $2.67 billion to $7.08 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.41 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for investment for the year ended 2020 includes $2.43 billion and $182.2 million of loans acquired from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, as well as $212.6 million of PPP loans outstanding as part of the CARES Act.\nOther noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $8.2 million to $15.3 million as compared to other noninterest income of $7.1 million for year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects a gain on commercial loans held for sale of $3.2 million related to changes in fair value from Franklin acquisition date to the end of 2020. Additionally, the increase reflect reflects increased swap fee income in addition to overall increases due to our growth and volume of business.\nDuring 2019, we made a strategic decision to sell our wholesale mortgage operations, which comprise the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent mortgage delivery channels. The exit of the two wholesale channels better aligns the Mortgage segment with our strategic plan and long-term vision for the Company. This has also allowed additional focus on our retail and Consumer Direct origination channels. In connection with the mortgage restructuring, the Company incurred related expenses, including $0.1 million attributed to the relief of goodwill, totaling $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.8 million to $135.4 million from $130.6 million from the same period in the previous year. The increase in noninterest income was largely a result of an increase in ATM and interchange fees related to our growth and volume of business.\nOur net income increased by 4.46% in 2019 to $83.8 million from $80.2 million in 2018. Pre-tax net income increased by $3.7 million, or 3.48%, from $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.65 and $2.55 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our net income represented a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.45% and 1.66% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a return on average shareholders' equity, or ROAE, of 11.6% and 12.7% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our ratio of return on average tangible common equity (\"ROATCE\") for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 15.4% and 16.7%, respectively.\nThe following tables set forth information related to the credit quality of our loan portfolio as of the dates presented.\nCredit trends\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $166.5 million to $301.9 million, up from $135.4 million for prior year period. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage banking income of $154.4 million to $255.3 million.\nWe also assumed two issues of subordinated debt, totaling $60,000, as part of the Franklin merger. The notes, issued in 2016, feature $40,000 of 6.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due March 30, 2026 (\"March 2026 Subordinated Notes\"), and $20,000 of 7% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due July 1, 2026 (\"July 2026 Subordinated Notes\"). Upon acquisition, we recorded a $0.8 million fair value premium adjustment, and during 2020, we recognized $0.4 million of amortization expense. Both note issuances currently pay interest semi-annually, and will begin resetting interest rates on a quarterly basis after March 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021. For years six through ten, interest for the March 2026 Subordinated Notes will based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 5.636% and interest for the July 2026 Subordinated Notes will be based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 6.04%.

See Note 19 \"Fair Value\" in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities, including a description of the fair value hierarchy.\nNet interest income\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we offered financial relief in the form of a payment deferral program to those experiencing financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These modifications were consistent with the \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\" and the CARES Act and did not qualify as TDRs. As of December 31, 2020, the total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status amounted to $1.40 billion. As of December 31, 2020, recorded balances in total loans remaining in deferral status under this program amounted to $202.5 million. The payment deferrals program differs from forbearance, in that all deferred payments are not normally due at the end of the deferral period. Instead, the payment due date is advanced to a future time period. Generally, interest continues to accrue on loans during the deferral period, unless the loan is on nonaccrual. The vast majority of our loans in deferral status are considered performing loans, and we anticipate collecting on these balances. We remain proactive in monitoring our loans in deferral status by reaching out to our borrowers with payment deferrals to determine their financial capacity and whether additional payment deferrals or other loan modifications are necessary.\nWhen a company's ratios are in excess of one or both of these guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by management.\n\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans that share similar risk characteristics collectively and loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually. See Note 5, Loans and allowance for credit losses\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these risk categories.\nWe operate our business in two business segments: Banking and Mortgage. See Note 21, Segment reporting\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these business segments.\nDue to state banking laws, the Bank may not declare dividends in any calendar year in an amount exceeding the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years, without the prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (\"TDFI\"). Based upon this regulation, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $185.7 million and $223.7 million of the Bank's retained earnings were available for the payment of dividends without such prior approval. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $48.8 million in cash dividends approved by the board for payment from the Bank to the holding company in addition to an asset dividend of an equity security amounting to $1.0 million. None of these required approval from the TDFI. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the board approved a dividend from the Bank to the holding company for $75.0 million that did not require approval from the TDFI. No dividends from the Bank to the Company were paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations\u201d ( ASC 805\u201d). Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of that date. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including any other identifiable intangible assets, exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Results of operations of acquired entities are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition.\nTotal deposits were $9.46 billion and $4.93 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $2.27 billion and $1.21 billion, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $7.18 billion and $3.73 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The 91.7% increase in total deposits from December 31, 2019 is partially attributed to merger and acquisition activity, including growth of $209.5 million in deposits assumed from Farmers National in the first quarter of 2020, and $3.12 billion in deposits assumed from the Franklin merger in the third quarter of 2020. We've also continued focus on core customer deposit growth, and increased escrow deposits that our third party servicing provider, Cenlar, transferred to the Bank.\nOf the loans shown above with floating interest rates, many have interest rate floors as follows:\n(6)Includes $1.0 million and $0.5 million of gain accretion from other comprehensive income from previously cancelled cash flow hedge for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See additional discussion at Note 18.\"Derivatives.\"\nBusiness segment highlights\nOur mortgage banking business is directly impacted by the interest rate environment, regulatory environment, consumer demand, economic conditions, and investor demand for mortgage securities. Mortgage production, especially refinance activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. While we have not yet experienced significant slowdowns in our mortgage production volume, our interest rate lock volume is expected to be materially and adversely impacted by rising interest rates, and we expect to see declining refinance activity within the mortgage industry when rates rise.\nThe Company is party to a registration rights agreement with its former majority shareholder entered into in connection with the 2016 IPO, under which the Company is responsible for payment of expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) relating to sales to the public by the shareholder of shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by him. Such expenses include registration fees, legal and accounting fees, and printing costs payable by the Company and expensed when incurred. No such expenses were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nas of December 31, 2020. PPP loans are federally guaranteed as part of the CARES Act, provided PPP loan recipients receive loan forgiveness under the SBA regulations. As such, there is minimal credit risk associated with these loans. Additionally, charge-offs increased to $15,305 as of December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to a single relationship with a charge-off of $9,932.\nThe cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, which are primarily driven by the Federal Reserve Board's actions. The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and are, at times, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve Board's actions. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur.\nReturn on equity and assets\nDevelopments in 2020\nWe evaluate available-for-sale securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, we consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition.\n(2)Includes $2.09 million of loan contractual interest and $3.92 million of loan fees related to PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNoninterest expense increased to $377.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in noninterest expense is reflective of the increase in mortgage commissions stemming from elevated business activity, as well as the impact of our acquisitions and integration activities, including increases in salaries, commissions and personnel-related costs from the incremental head count.\nThese results were significantly impacted by the economic forecasts incorporated in our CECL loss rate model, leading our provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments increased to $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our results were also impacted by an increase in merger expenses that totaled $34.9 million relating to our acquisitions of Franklin\nvalue is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, and for fixed-rate commitments, the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates is also considered.\nWe grew total deposits by $4.52 billion to $9.46 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.93 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase includes $3.12 billion of deposits assumed in the Franklin acquisition and $209.5 million assumed in the Farmers National acquisition.\nMulti-family residential loans. Our multi-family residential loans are primarily secured by multi-family properties, such as apartments and condominium buildings. These loans may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $226.0 million compared to $204.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was attributable to an increase in interest income and expense, primarily driven by loan and deposit growth driven by declining interest rates and our growth initiatives, including the Atlantic Capital branch acquisition.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nOn August 15, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Franklin Financial Network, Inc (\"Franklin\"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired total assets of $3.63 billion, loans of $2.79 billion and assumed total deposits of $3.12 billion. Total loans acquired included a non-strategic institutional portfolio with a fair value of $326.2 million the Company classified as held for sale. Franklin common shareholders received 15,058,181 shares of the Company's common stock, net of the equivalent value of 44,311 shares withheld on certain Franklin employee equity awards that vested upon change in control, as consideration in connection with the merger, in addition to $31.3 million in cash consideration. The Company also issued replacement restricted stock units to replace those initially granted by Franklin in 2020 that did not vest upon change in control, with a total fair value of $0.7 million attributed to pre-combination service. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $29.52 on August 15, 2020, the merger consideration represented approximately $477.8 million in aggregate consideration.\n(1)Yields on a tax-equivalent basis.\n(1)Includes tax-equivalent adjustment.\nDerivative financial instruments\n(5)Includes $0.9 million and $0 of interest rate premium accretion on money market deposits, $2.0 million and $0 on customer time deposits and $0.4 million and $0.1 million on brokered and internet deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther borrowings\nLoan maturity and sensitivities\nOur profitability and growth are affected by the highly competitive nature of the financial services industry. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, online mortgage providers, internet banks and other financial institutions operating within the areas we serve, particularly with national and regional banks that often have more resources than we do to invest in growth and technology and community banks with strong local ties, all of which target the same clients we do. Recently, we have seen increased competitive pressures on loan rates. Continued loan pricing pressure may continue to affect our financial results in the future.\n\nMergers and acquisitions\nAdditional discussion can be found under the subheading \"Asset quality\" contained within management's discussion and analysis and in \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" and \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5.

Loan fees of $16.0 million, $13.0 million, and $13.1 million, accretion of $3.8 million, $8.6 million, and $7.6 million, nonaccrual interest collections of $1.4 million, $0.9 million, and $1.4 million, and syndicated loan fees of $0, $0.2 million, and $0.4 million are included in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, we evaluated for changes in reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in projected credit deterioration requiring us to recognize significant increases in the ACL. Specifically, we performed additional qualitative evaluations for certain categories within our loan portfolio, in line with our established qualitative framework, weighting the impact of the current economic outlook, status of federal government stimulus programs, and other considerations, in order to identify specific industries or borrowers seeing credit improvement or deterioration specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also increased the ACL by $82.1 million of which $77.7 million related to loans acquired on August 15, 2020, as part of the Franklin acquisition and $4.5 million related to loans acquired on February 14, 2020, as part of the Farmers National acquisition. Outside of the impact of Franklin on the provision for credit losses, the remaining loan portfolio benefited from improved economic forecasts, seen for the first time in 2020, reflective of the resumption of more normalized commercial activity within our markets. See Note 2, \"Mergers and acquisitions\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to PCD loans.\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change. The current operating environment also has heightened supervisory expectations in areas such as consumer compliance, the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance, risk management and internal audit. As a result of our increase in asset size above $10 billion and these heightened expectations, we expect to incur additional costs for additional compliance, risk management and audit personnel or professional fees associated with advisors and consultants.\nWe have evaluated our nonperforming loans held for investment and believe all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020. Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Loans not considered nonperforming include loans 30-89 days past due amounting to $27.0 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2019. Periods prior to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 exclude purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") loans from nonperforming totals while the current period includes PCD loans at their contractual number of days past due. Loans in deferral status are considered current.\nOur noninterest income includes gains on sales of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of loans held for sale and derivatives, fees on mortgage loan originations, loan servicing fees, hedging results, fees generated from deposit services, investment services and trust income, gains and losses on securities, other real estate owned and other assets and other miscellaneous noninterest income.\nWe had net interest recoveries on nonperforming assets previously charged off of $1.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther noninterest expense primarily includes mortgage servicing expenses, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, software license and maintenance fees and various other miscellaneous expenses. Other noninterest expense increased $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $55.0 million compared to $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects costs associated with our growth, including the impact of our acquisitions, as well as a one-time prepayment penalty of $6.8 million, incurred in connection with our repayment of $150.0 million in long-term advances and $100.0 million in 90 day fixed rate advances.\nCOVID-19 and the CARES Act\nWe utilize forward loan sale contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in our mortgage loan pipeline and held-for-sale portfolio. Forward loan sale contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of mortgage loans. We agree to deliver on a specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. However, the contract may allow for cash settlement. The credit risk inherent to us arises from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. In the event of non-acceptance by the counterparty, we would be subject to the credit and inherent (or market) risk of the loans retained. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives and, along with related fees paid to investor are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. Fair value is based on the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the commitment at the reporting date.\n(1)Average loans are gross, including nonaccrual loans and overdrafts (before deduction of allowance for credit losses). Loan fees of $16.0 million and $13.0 million, accretion of $3.8 million and $8.6 million, nonaccrual interest collections of $1.4 million and $0.9 million, and syndicated loan fee income of $0 and $0.2 million are included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nOur level of short-term borrowing can fluctuate on a daily basis depending on funding needs and the source of funds to satisfy those needs, in addition to the overall interest rate environment and cost of public funds. Borrowings can include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, federal funds, and subordinated debt.\n\nCapital Expenditures\nBorrowed funds\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\n\n(8)Includes $0.9 million and $0 of interest rate premium accretion on money market deposits, $2.0 million and $0 on customer time deposits and $0.4 million and $0.1 million on brokered and internet deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $18.8 million and $25.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This represents effective tax rates of 22.84% and 23.48% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary differences from the enacted rates are applicable state income taxes reduced for non-taxable income and tax credits, and additional deductions for equity-based compensation upon the distribution of restricted stock units.\nModifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\u201d (the Interagency Statement\u201d) that encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further stipulated that a qualified loan modification was exempt by law from classification as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020, or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic is terminated. Section 541 of the CAA\n\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $40.6 million to $268.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $227.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in loan volume influenced by the Franklin merger, which was also impacted by a decrease in overall cost of deposits.\n\nThe merger resulted in goodwill of $67.2 million being recorded based on the fair value of total assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction.\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than the categories of loans disclosed in the table above. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified relative to industry concentrations across the various loan portfolio categories. While most industries have and are expected to continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of COVID-19, certain industries present more risk than others. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding loan principal balances of loans in deferral status amounted to $202.5 million. The following presents industry loan categories considered to be of concern\u201d in relation to our total portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\nBanking\nAllowance for credit losses\nClassified loans\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act (\"CAA\") that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the HHSB Act\u201d). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. In addition to extending and amending the PPP, the HHSB Act also creates a new grant program for shuttered venue operators.\u201d As a participating lender in the PPP, the Company continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.\nOur methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses includes the use of lifetime loss rate models. The quantitative models require tailored loan data and macroeconomic variables based on the inherent credit risks in each portfolio to more accurately measure the credit risks associated with each. Each of the quantitative models pools loans with similar risk characteristics and collectively assesses the lifetime loss rate for each pool to estimate its expected credit loss. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in any given pool, the loan is individually assessed.\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2020, our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date (excluding interest). These contractual obligations are discussed in more detail within in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.\nThe allowance for credit losses is our best estimate. Actual losses may differ from the December 31, 2020 allowance for credit loss as the CECL estimate is sensitive to economic forecasts and management judgment.\nBusiness combinations and accounting for acquired loans with credit deterioration\nAdditional sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased, FHLB borrowings, and lines of credit. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Funds and advances obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. There were no outstanding overnight cash management advances (\"CMAs\") at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of our outstanding additional long-term advances with the FHLB were $0.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The remaining balance available with the FHLB was $1,176.1 million and $435.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit typically maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no borrowings against the lines at December 31, 2020 and at December 31, 2019.\nThe allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments increased to $16.4 million at December 31, 2020, and the deferred tax asset related to the ACL increased to $48.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe tables below present the components of the changes in net interest income for the the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volumes and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category.\nWe utilize derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company enters into swaps, interest rate cap and/or floor agreements with its customers and then enters into an offsetting derivative contract position with other financial institutions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts. Because these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.\nBanking regulators have established thresholds of less than 100% of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in construction lending and less than 300% of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in commercial real estate lending that management monitors as part of the risk management process. The construction concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding construction and land development loans to total tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. The commercial real estate concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and construction and land development loans to tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. Management strives to operate within the thresholds set forth above.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the increase in cost of funds partially offset by an increase in contractual loan yield earned on our loan portfolio.\nOur NIM, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% during the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.34% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a declining interest rate environment and change in balance sheet mix, partially attributable to our acquisition of Franklin during the year.\nResults of operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not committed to enter any material capital expenditures over the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nWe enter into commitments to originate and purchase loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate-lock commitments). Rate-lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives. Accordingly, such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in other assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. Fair\nLoan categories\nAverage deposit balances by type, together with the average rates per period are reflected in the average balance sheet amounts, interest paid and rate analysis tables included in this management's discussion and analysis under the subheading \"Results of operations\" discussion.\nInterest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $317.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $284.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $33.1 million. Interest income on loans held for investment, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $27.4 million to $278.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased loan volume driven by growth in average loan balances of $1.47 billion. The growth in average loan balance reflects the addition of $182.2 million in loans acquired from Farmers National and $2.43 billion in loans acquired in the Franklin merger. In addition, the origination of PPP loans during the period contributed $206.8 million to the increase in average total loans held for investment.\n(3)Includes investments in premises and equipment, other real estate owned, interest receivable, MSRs, core deposit and other intangibles, goodwill and other miscellaneous assets.\nThe efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. For an adjusted efficiency ratio, we exclude certain gains, losses and expenses we do not consider core to our business.\n(2) Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis.\n(7)Includes $0.4 million of accretion on subordinated debt fair value mark for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur total shareholders' equity was $1,291.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $762.3 million, at December 31, 2019. Book value per share was $27.35 at December 31, 2020 and $24.56 at December 31, 2019. The growth in shareholders' equity during 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in additional paid-in capital and common stock; a result of our acquisitive growth strategy through the merger with Franklin and the acquisition of Farmers National. Other changes in shareholders' equity were driven by earnings retention and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by a cumulative effective adjustment of $25.0 million on January 1, 2020 for the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and to a lesser extent, declared dividends and activity related to equity-based compensation.\nAs discussed above, the $27.4 million increase in interest income on loans held for investment during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was the primary driver of the $40.6 million increase in tax-equivalent net interest income. The increase in loan interest income was driven by an increase in average loans held for investment of $1.47 billion, or 35.5%, to $5.62 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely attributable to the acquisition of $182.2 million in loans from the Farmers National acquisition and $2.43 billion in loans from the Franklin merger plus an increase of $206.8 million in average PPP loans. The total decrease in interest expense of $7.5 million was primarily driven by decreases in rates on money market and customer time deposits partially offset by increase in volume, partially related to our acquisitions.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, interest rates fell to historic lows during the year ended December 31, 2020. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u2018\u2018FOMC'') reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. On March 15, 2020 the Federal Reserve announced it would revive its quantitative easing program to provide liquidity to the U.S. treasury and mortgage markets by committing to buy $500 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $200 billion of agency mortgage backed securities. On March 16, 2020, the FOMC further reduced the target federal funds rate by an additional 100 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. On March 23, 2020 the Federal Reserve modified its quantitative easing program initiative to an unlimited purchase program that is expected to exceed the monetary policy support provided during the financial crisis over 10 years ago. These actions could have significant adverse effects on the earnings, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nWe did not record any provision for credit losses for its available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the majority of the investment portfolio is government guaranteed and declines in fair value below amortized cost were determined to be non-credit related.\nThe following table provides details of our nonperforming assets, the ratio of such loans and other nonperforming assets to total assets, and certain other related information as of the dates presented:\nNoninterest income amounted to $301.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $166.5 million, or 122.9%, as compared to $135.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest income in the above table are discussed below.\nAs a member of the FHLB Cincinnati, the Bank receives advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various agreements that assist in funding its mortgage and loan portfolio balance sheet. Under the agreements, we pledge qualifying residential mortgages of $1,248.9 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $1,532.7 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $1,276.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we pledged qualifying residential mortgages of $413.0 million and qualifying commercial mortgages of $545.5 million as collateral securing a line of credit with a total borrowing capacity of $760.6 million.\nThe following tables present the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Loans with scheduled maturities are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. Demand loans with no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported in the due in 1 year or less\u201d category. Loans that have adjustable rates are shown as amortizing to final maturity rather than when the interest rates are next subject to change. The tables do not include prepayment assumptions or scheduled repayments. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $22.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively, in fixed-rate loans in which the Company has entered into variable rate swap contracts.\n(3)Includes $1.0 million and $0.5 million of gain accretion from other comprehensive income from a previously cancelled cash flow hedge for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives and when the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company, we apply the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss on off-balance-sheet commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit commitments is recognized as a liability. When the loan is funded, an allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for that loan using the CECL methodology, and the liability for off-balance-sheet commitments is reduced. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss, we consider the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions.\nInterest expense was $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $7.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver was the impact of the decrease in interest rates on deposits, resulting in total deposit interest expense decrease of $8.7 million to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was largely attributed to money market deposits which decreased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and customer time deposits which decreased to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate on money markets decreased to 0.76%, down 66 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. Average money market balances increased $587.8 million to $1,807.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,219.7 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease in interest expense on customer time deposits was primarily driven by decreased interest rates as the average rate on customer time deposits decreased 57 basis points from 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.52% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of deposits was 0.62% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.10% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe components of mortgage banking income for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nMortgage loans held for sale were $683.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $262.5 million at December 31, 2019. Interest rate lock volume for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $8.94 billion and $5.90 billion, respectively. Generally, mortgage volume increases in lower interest rate environments and robust housing markets and decreases in rising interest rate environments and slower housing markets. The increase in interest rate lock volume for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects the increased volume in our retail and ConsumerDirect channels, which benefited from the lower interest rate environment when compared to the previous year. Interest rate lock commitments in the pipeline were $1.19 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $453.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category as well as the ratio of loans by loan category compared to the total loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we determined that all available-for-sale debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses recognized on available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome from mortgage servicing of $22.1 million and $17.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was offset by declines in fair value of MSRs and related hedging activity of $34.4 million and $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAllowance for credit losses\nOur efficiency ratio was 66.4% and 67.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 59.2% and 65.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d in this Report for a discussion of the adjusted efficiency ratio.\n\nAverage balance sheet amounts, interest earned and yield analysis\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and access to funding sources. To date, we have not seen significant pressure on liquidity or sources of funding as a result of COVID-19 and have maintained higher than typical levels of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents to allow for flexibility.\n\nFinancial condition\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized significant increases in our provision for credit losses and merger costs, which resulted in return on average total assets of 0.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average shareholders' equity was 6.58% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs described further under Business: Supervision and regulation,\u201d we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in the \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" and Risk Factors\" sections of this Annual Report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nFinancial condition\nOur net income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $63.6 million from $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.67 and $2.65 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net income represented a ROAA of 0.75% and 1.45% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a ROAE of 6.58% and 11.6% for the same periods. Our ratio of ROATCE for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 8.54% and 15.4%, respectively.\nMortgage\nWe operate through two segments, Banking and Mortgage. We generate most of our revenue in our Banking segment from interest on loans and investments, loan-related fees, mortgage originations from mortgage offices within our banking footprint, trust and investment services and deposit-related fees. Our primary source of funding for our loans is customer deposits, and, to a lesser extent, unsecured credit lines, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances, brokered and internet deposits, and other borrowings. We generate most of our revenue in our Mortgage segment from origination fees and gains on sales in the secondary market of mortgage loans that we originate from our mortgage offices outside our Banking footprint and through our online ConsumerDirect channel, as well as from mortgage servicing revenues.\nDeposits and investment securities available for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, we may also obtain advances from the FHLB, purchase federal funds and engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve, correspondent banks, or enter into client repurchase agreements. We also use these sources of funds as part of our asset liability management process to control our long-term interest rate risk exposure, even if it may increase our short-term cost of funds.\nWe enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements are made to provide customers with comprehensive treasury management programs a short-term return for their excess funds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $32.2 million and $23.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for loans previously classified as purchased credit impaired (\"PCI\") and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption and all PCI loans were transitioned to PCD loans upon adoption. Under PCD accounting,the amount of expected credit losses as of the acquisition date is added to the purchase price of the PCD loan. This establishes the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the PCD loan and the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan as of the acquisition date is the non-credit discount. Interest income for a PCD loan is recognized by accreting the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan to its contractual cash flows. The discount related to estimated credit losses on acquisition recorded as an allowance for credit losses will not be accreted into interest income. Only the noncredit-related discount will be accreted into interest income and subsequent adjustments to expected credit losses will flow through the provision for credit losses on the income statement.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within fifteen to twenty-five days after the loan is funded, depending on the economic environment and competition in the market. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nWe enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are recorded as other comprehensive income and are subsequently recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. The assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method.\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $94.6 million as compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The steep increase in provision for credit losses was primarily the result of conforming the acquired loan portfolios to comply with CECL under our established framework and governance model, as CECL requires the establishment of an allowance for credit losses for non-purchased credit deteriorated loans be recognized through the provision for credit losses on the acquisition date. In addition to the impact of the acquired portfolios during the year, our provision for credit losses was impacted by declining economic forecasts resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Farmers National acquisition on February 14, 2020 amounted to $2.9 million while the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment recognized in expense in conjunction with the Franklin merger on August 15, 2020 amounted to $52.8 million. The remaining $38.9 million included in the provision for credit losses is reflective of activity for both the Company's legacy non-acquired portfolios and the acquired portfolios of Farmers National and Franklin from their respective acquisition dates through the remainder of 2020. Although the portfolio benefited from improving economic forecasts in the last half of 2020, there is much uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to lead to increased volatility in forecasted macroeconomic variables, a key input to our calculated level of allowance for credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, our policy for the allowance for credit losses changed with the adoption of CECL. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adopting CECL, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nMortgage loans held for sale\nSubordinated debt\nCommercial and industrial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. Our commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital and operating needs and business expansions, including the purchase of capital equipment and loans made to farmers relating to their operations. This category also includes loans secured by manufactured housing receivables. Commercial and industrial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. This category also includes the loans we originated as part of the PPP, established by the CARES Act. The PPP is administered by the SBA, and loans we originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules. These federally guaranteed loans were intended to provide up to 24 weeks of payroll and other operating costs as a source of aid to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are generally made with operating cash flows as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and personal guarantees. We plan to continue to make commercial and industrial loans an area of emphasis in our lending operations in the future. Excluding PPP loans totaling $212.6 million as of December 31, 2020, our commercial and industrial loans comprised $1,133.5 million, or 16% of our loans held for investment.\nFor additional information regarding our interest rate risks factors and management, see Business: Risk management: Liquidity and interest rate risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\n\nFor loans due after one year or more, the following tables present the sensitivities to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to $265.7 million compared with $226.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest income includes the amortization and accretion of purchase premium and discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method anticipating prepayments based upon the prior three month average monthly prepayments when available. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied loans. Our commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate non-owner occupied investment properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, health care facilities, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial, manufactured housing communities, retail centers, multifamily properties, assisted living facilities and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale of the completed property or rental proceeds from such property, and are therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market, which can also be affected by general economic conditions.\nOverview of recent financial performance\nRate/volume analysis\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 health pandemic created a crisis resulting in volatility in financial markets, sudden, unprecedented job losses, and disruption in consumer and commercial behavior, resulting in governments in the United States and globally to intervene with varying levels of direct monetary support and fiscal stimulus packages. All industries, municipalities and consumers have been impacted by the health crisis to some degree, including the markets that we serve. In attempts to flatten the curve\u201d, businesses not deemed essential were closed or constrained to capacity limitations, individuals were asked to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses, leading to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, widening of credit spreads, dislocation of bond markets, disruption of global supply chains and changes in consumer spending behavior. As certain restrictions began lifting and more businesses were allowed to open their doors in late 2020, we began to experience a slow improvement in commerce through much of our footprint. Despite the pickup in economic activity late in the year, there is uncertainty regarding the long term effects on the global economy which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nTotal assets\nThe following table summarizes activity in our allowance for credit losses during the periods indicated:\nMortgage servicing rights\n(1)Calculated using daily averages.\nFair Value Measurements\nIncome before taxes from the Mortgage segment increased to $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased volume driven by declining interest rates and an increase in refinancing activity. The increase in volume contributed to noninterest income increasing $109.4 million to $179.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company obtained a line of credit for $20.0 million, of which $15.0 million was borrowed to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National acquisition.\nLoan portfolio\n(1) Average loans are gross, including nonaccrual loans and overdrafts (before deduction of allowance for loan losses). Loan fees of $13.0 million and $13.1 million, accretion of $8.6 million and $7.6 million, nonaccrual interest collections of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, and syndicated loan fee income of $0.2 million and $0.4 million are included in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $84.2 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included $5.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of excess land and facilities held for sale resulting from our acquisitions. Other nonperforming assets, including other repossessed non-real estate, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 amounted to $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank's mortgage operations had sales of $6.24 billion which generated a gain on sales margin of 3.79%. This compares to $4.55 billion and 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gain on sales margin is a result of the mortgage restructuring in 2019, and productive market conditions in 2020. The industry benefited greatly from declining interest rates in 2020, causing a sharp increase in volume in 2020. Mortgage banking income from gains on sale and related fair value changes increased to $267.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total interest rate lock volume increased $3,036.0 million, or 51.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. The volume mix of refinances and purchases also shifted during year ended December 31, 2020 to 77.6% refinance volume compared with 56.2% during the previous year.\nOn August 15, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. The loans had an acquisition date fair value of $326.2 million, which declined to $215.4 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to loans within the portfolio being paid off through external refinancing. This decrease is also partially offset by a change in fair value after acquisition amounting to a gain of $3.2 million, which is included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nDeposits\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. We determine the appropriateness of the allowance through periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters. See \"Critical accounting policies - Allowance for credit losses\" for additional information regarding our methodology.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and general practices within the banking industry. Within our financial statements, certain financial information contain approximate measurements of financial effects of transactions and impacts at the consolidated balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards and subsequent adoptions, are discussed in further detail in \"Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" of this Report.\nNoninterest expense increased to $244.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $223.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018. The increase in noninterest expense reflects the impact of our acquisition of the Branches, including increases in salaries, commissions and personnel-related costs and increased merger expenses. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 also reflects expenses of $2.0 million related to the sale of our wholesale mortgage origination channels comprising the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent origination channels (collectively referred to as \"mortgage restructuring\").\nNonperforming assets\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio segregated into fixed and floating interest rate loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to\nMortgage banking income attributable to our Banking segment from retail operations within the Bank footprint was $75.4 million and $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and mortgage banking income attributable to our Mortgage segment was $179.9 million and $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe following table sets forth the distribution by type of our deposit accounts for the dates indicated:\nCritical accounting policies\nBeginning January 1, 2020, loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are considered to be Purchased Credit Deteriorated (\"PCD\"). The Company developed multiple criteria to assess the presence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration in acquired loans, mainly focused on changes in credit quality and payment status. While general criteria have been established, each acquisition will vary in its specific facts and circumstances and the Company will apply judgment around PCD identification for each individual acquisition based on their unique portfolio mix and risks identified.\nOur net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, influenced by declining interest rates during the current period.\n\nThe following table sets forth the fair value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated below:\nThe table below shows concentration ratios for the Bank and Company as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, which both were within the stated thresholds.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale and their approximate fair values as of the dates shown:\nOverall Objective\nAccretion on purchased loans contributed 5 and 16 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in accretion is due in part to the adoption of CECL and purchase accounting resulting from our merger with Franklin, that contributed a net premium of $11.3 million recorded as of August 15, 2020, to be amortized as a reduction to loan interest income. Contractual interest and origination fees on PPP loans attributed 8 basis points to the NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020. We anticipate recognizing an estimated $2.7 million in deferred origination fees, net of third party costs and deferred salaries, over the remaining life of the PPP loan portfolio.\nEfficiency ratio\nAs of January 1, 2020, our policy for the allowance changed with the adoption of CECL to a lifetime expected credit loss approach. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adoption, we calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach.\nLoans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, primarily mortgage loans, are carried at fair value as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC 825\u201d). Net gains (losses) resulting from fair value changes of these mortgage loans are recorded in income. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both mortgage loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in Mortgage banking income\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses are recognized in Mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income at the time the loan is closed. Pass through origination costs and related loan fees are also included in Mortgage banking income\u201d. Other expenses are classified in the appropriate noninterest expense accounts. Periodically, we will transfer mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary markets into the loan portfolio based on current market conditions, the overall secondary marketability of the loan and the status of the loan. The loans are transferred into the portfolio at fair value at the date of transfer.\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest, when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Beginning January 1, 2020, unrealized losses resulting from credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings as a provision for credit losses. Unrealized losses that do not result from credit losses are excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, which is included in equity. Accrued interest receivable is separated from other components of amortized cost and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $108.0 million under the current expected credit loss methodology compared with $7.1 million under the previous incurred loss model. Our provision was comprised of $94.6 million related to provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and $13.4 million related to provision for unfunded commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was greatly impacted by negative economic forecasts in our loss rate allowance for credit losses model promulgated by the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Economic forecasts slowly improved in the last half of 2020, however we believe the true impact of the pandemic on our loan portfolio could lag beyond the economic turnaround as borrower assistance programs are exhausted. While we continue to be sensitive to credit quality risks in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loan portfolios due to our concentration of loans in these categories, we believe our portfolio is well balanced overall. Although we have not experienced significant credit losses to date, we continue to closely monitor industries that present elevated risk of adverse impact. As of December 31, 2020, loans within these industries we consider \"of concern\" amounted to approximately 23.8% of our total loans held for investment. Additional detail summarizing our exposure to industries \"of concern\" is further discussed under the \"Financial Condition\" subheading within this management's discussion and analysis.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans include consumer loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans are generally secured by vehicles and other household goods. The collateral securing consumer loans may depreciate over time. The company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards. Other loans also include loans to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. These loans are generally subject to the risk that the borrowing municipality or political subdivision may lose a significant portion of its tax base or that the project for which the loan was made may produce inadequate revenue. None of these categories of loans represents a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nThe OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC (collectively, \"the Agencies\") initially provided an option within the regulatory capital framework to limit the initial regulatory \"day one\" adverse impact by allowing a three-year phase in period for said impact. In March 2020, the Agencies subsequently announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). We elected the five-year capital transition relief option.\nResults of operations\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\n(1) Minimum ratios presented exclude the capital conservation buffer.\nFranklin Financial Network, Inc.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), a nearly $670 billion program, as amended, designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee up to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs, including rent and other operating costs, to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to continue paying bills. Over the course of 2020, we originated over 2,900 PPP loans, with $314,678 in total balances through the US Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). The SBA began accepting PPP forgiveness applications in the last quarter of 2020, which decreased total balances to $212,645 as of December 31, 2020. Balances will continue to decline throughout 2021 as the SBA continues accepting forgiveness applications.\nInterest rates\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of FNB Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmers National Bank of Scottsville (collectively, \"Farmers National\"). Following the acquisition, Farmers National was merged into the Company with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. The Company acquired total assets of $258.2 million, loans of $182.2 million and deposits of $209.5 million. The consideration is valued at approximately $50.0 million based on 954,797 shares of the Company's common stock (utilizing the Company's market price of $36.70 on February 14, 2020) and $15.0 million in cash consideration. The acquisition resulted in $6.3 million of goodwill.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the classifications set forth in the following table. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we exceeded all capital ratio requirements under prompt corrective action and other regulatory requirements, as detailed in the table below:\nCompetition\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of 2020, we placed $100.0 million of ten year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, maturing September 1, 2030. This subordinated note instrument pays interest semi-annually in arrears based on a 4.5% fixed annual interest rate for the first five years of the notes. For years six through ten, the interest rate resets on a quarterly basis, and will be based on the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a spread of 439 basis points. We are entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after September 1, 2025. The Company has classified the issuance, net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,772, as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\nIncome taxes\nOverview\nBrokered and internet time deposits at December 31, 2020 increased by $41.2 million to $61.6 million compared with $20.4 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was the result of assuming Franklin's brokered and internet time deposits, totaling $107.5 million at August 15, 2020; this balance has declined since acquisition through continued overall balance sheet management as we continue to replace brokered and internet time deposits with less costly funding sources.\nMerger costs amounted to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, merger costs consisted of $7.7 million of contract termination costs, $5.6 million of branch closing and consolidation costs, $7.7 million of professional fees, $6.6 million of severance and separation benefits, $4.5 million of conversion-related costs, and $2.7 million of other acquisition-related costs. Costs during the previous year were related to our acquisition of the Branches, which closed during the second quarter of the previous year. We anticipate to continue incurring severance and separation benefits through the first half of 2021 for certain merger-related employment agreements.\n\nContractual obligations\n\nThe Company accounts for its mortgage servicing rights under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 860-50-35, \"Transfers and Servicing\". The Company retains the right to service certain mortgage loans that it sells to secondary market investors. The retained mortgage servicing right is initially recorded at the fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors. These mortgage servicing rights are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold.\nand Farmers National during year ended December 31, 2020 compared with merger expenses of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of the Branches.\nThe following table shows the carrying value of our total securities available for sale by investment type and the relative percentage of each investment type for the dates indicated:\n\nConstruction loans. Our construction loans include commercial construction, land acquisition and land development loans and single-family interim construction loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals. These loans are generally secured by the land or the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis. We expect to continue to make construction loans at a similar pace so long as demand continues and the market for and values of such properties remain stable or continue to improve in our markets. These loans can carry risk of repayment when projects incur cost overruns, have an increase in the price of building materials, encounter zoning and environmental issues, or encounter other factors that may affect the completion of a project on time and on budget. Additionally, repayment risk may be negatively impacted when the market experiences a deterioration in the value of real estate.\nSalaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expenses representing 62.0% and 62.1% of total noninterest expense in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $81.7 million, or 53.7%, to $233.8 million as compared to $152.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly driven by our increase in headcount as a result of our mergers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, FTE's increased to 1,852 as of December 31, 2020 from 1,377 as of December 31, 2019. Also included in total salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense was an increase of $41.8 million in commissions and incentives expenses resulting from increased mortgage production previously discussed.\nThe components of our loan yield, a key driver to our NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. Changes in fair value from the acquisition date fair value are included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.\nOur capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the TDFI, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe table below shows the average balances, income and expense and yield and rates of each of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis, if applicable, for the periods indicated.\nNon-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19\nLoans held for sale\nOur total assets were $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to total assets of $6.12 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to our acquisition of Farmers National, completed on February 14, 2020 and merger with Franklin on August 15, 2020, which added assets of $258.2 million and $3.63 billion, respectively, combined with our participation in the PPP. Additionally, the increase is partially related to the $212.6 million of outstanding PPP loans at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.32 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.09 billion during the year 2020, up from $232.7 million at December 31, 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure adequate liquidity.\nNoninterest expense increased by $132.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $377.1 million as compared to $244.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in selected components of noninterest expense in the above table are discussed below.\nShareholders' equity\nIncome before taxes from the Banking segment decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $5.9 million, compared to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These results were primarily driven by the provisions for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments totaling $108.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $7.1 million in the previous year. Net interest income increased $39.5 million to $265.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $226.1 million in the same period in the prior year. Noninterest income increased to $122.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $64.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Noninterest expense increased $96.8 million, primarily due to merger and other costs associated with our overall growth, including increased salaries, commissions and employee benefits expenses associated with incremental headcount following our acquisitions. Results of our Banking Segment also include mortgage retail footprint pre-tax net contribution of $26.4 million and $7.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nWe have numerous customers that have experienced financial distress, as a direct result of COVID-19, and in response we introduced a payment deferral program to assist during these unprecedented times. The total amortized cost of loans deferred during 2020 that were no longer in deferral status was $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2020. We had a recorded investment in loans remaining on Company-sponsored deferred payment programs totaling $202.5 million as of December 31, 2020 , representing approximately 2.9% of our loans held for investment. Of the loans granted deferrals, these modifications typically range between sixty to ninety days and were not considered TDRs under the interagency regulatory guidance or the CARES Act. Additionally, we service mortgages on behalf of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, and as of December 31, 2020 approximately 6% of customers serviced on behalf of the aforementioned companies have received forbearance assistance. COVID-19 is expected to continue to influence commerce worldwide and the magnitude to which our financial results will be impacted is uncertain at this time.\nThe fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 was $1,172.4 million compared to $688.4 million at December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we purchased $425.0 million (excluding those acquired from Farmers National and merged from Franklin) and $151.4 million in investment securities, respectively. The trade value of securities sold was $146.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The trade value of securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $24.5 million, respectively. Maturities and calls of securities totaled $220.5 million and $113.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net unrealized gains of $34.6 million and $11.7 million, respectively, were unrealized on available-for-sale debt securities.\nAs part of our liquidity management strategy, we also focus on minimizing our costs of liquidity and attempt to decrease these costs by growing our noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits, while replacing higher cost funding sources including time deposits and borrowed funds. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer.\n(5)The NIM is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, by average total earning assets.\nthe respective fifth anniversary of each note issuance. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the issuance that we intend to exercise our rights to redeem the $40.0 million note in full during the first quarter of 2021. We classified the entire $60,000 in subordinated notes as Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2020.\ndual mandate of full employment and stable prices. The FOMC maintained the Federal Funds rate to zero lower bound, and maintained their commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. During the last half of 2020, the US Treasury yield curve steepened as long-term rates rose. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to continue having a negative impact on net interest income. Other financial impacts could occur, though such potential impacts are unknown at this time.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year ended December 31, 2018\nDuring 2020, our percentage of total nonperforming loans to loans held for investment increased to 0.91% as of December 31, 2020, from 0.60% at December 31, 2019. Our loans classified as substandard and doubtful increased to 1.87% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2020, compared to 1.82% as of December 31, 2019. Our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 were $84.2 million, or 0.75% of total assets, increasing from $47.1 million, or 0.77% of assets as of December 31, 2019.\nThere were no borrowings against the line as of December 31, 2020, while borrowings against the line totaled $250.0 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no FHLB advances as of December 31, 2020, while FHLB advances as of December 31, 2019 includes two long-term advances with putable features totaling $150.0 million. These two long-term advances of $100.0 million and $50.0 million carry maximum final terms of 10 years and 7 years, respectively. However, the FHLB owns the option to cancel the advances after one year and quarterly thereafter at predetermined fixed rates of 1.24% and 1.37%, respectively These putable advances were paid off in the fourth quarter of 2020 at a penalty of $4.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. There were no overnight cash management advances (CMAs) outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Letters of credit with FHLB of $100.0 million and $75.0 million were pledged to secure public funds that required collateral as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no 90-day fixed-rate advances were included in total FHLB advances. The maximum amount of FHLB borrowing outstanding at any month end was $250.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted average interest rate on FHLB borrowings was 0.00% and 1.51% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nKey factors affecting our business\nNet interest income is the largest contributor to our net income and is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board and market interest rates.\nWe have two wholly-owned subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts ( Trusts\u201d). The Trusts were created for the sole purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities to fund the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our $0.9 million investment in the Trusts was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and our $30.0 million obligation is reflected as junior subordinated debt, respectively. The junior subordinated debt bears interest at floating interest rates based on a spread over 3-month LIBOR plus 315 basis points (3.40% and 5.10% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the $21.7 million debenture and 3-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points (3.50% and 5.19% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) for the remaining $9.3 million. The $9.3 million debenture may be redeemed prior to the 2033 maturity date upon the occurrence of a special event, and the $21.7 million debenture may be redeemed prior to 2033 at our option.\nRegulatory trends and changes in laws\nIncluded in noninterest-bearing deposits are certain mortgage escrow and related customer deposits that our third-party servicing provider, Cenlar, transfers to the Bank which totaled $148.0 million and $92.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally, our deposits from municipal and governmental entities (i.e. \"public deposits\") totaled $1,677.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $463.1 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nHowever, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. If we determine a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale investment security has resulted from credit related factors, beginning January 1, 2020 with the adoption of CECL, we record a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the impairment related to other, non-credit related, factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe Bank maintains lines with certain correspondent banks that provide borrowing capacity in the form of federal funds purchased in the aggregate amount of $335.0 million and $305.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no borrowings against the line at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nU.S. Basel III measures capital strength in three tiers and incorporates risk-adjusted assets to determine the risk-based capital ratios. Our CET1 capital primarily includes shareholders' equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangibles, net of taxes, net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities and derivative instruments, net of tax. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital and included junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $30.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Tier 2 capital components include a portion of the allowance for credit losses in excess of Tier 1 statutory limits and our remaining combined trust preferred security debt issuances.\nFNB Financial Corp. merger\nCosts resulting from our equity compensation grants during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $10.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively. These grants comprise restricted stock units granted to all new full-time associates each year in addition to annual performance grants, employment agreement grants and grants resulting from acquisition. Additionally, during 2020 we began granting performance-based stock units, which resulted in $1.0 million in expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition compares balances as of December 31, 2020 with December 31, 2019.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor additional information, see Business: Our markets,\u201d Business: Competition\u201d and Risk factors: Risks related to our business.\u201d\nBank liquidity management\nHolding company liquidity management\nLoans by type\nThe following table sets forth our total borrowings segmented by years to maturity as of December 31, 2020:\n\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which in accordance with GAAP, are not included as part of our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit, and commitments to purchase loans, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 17, \"Commitments and contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\n\nextends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators' views on consumer protection considerations.\nCommercial loans held for sale\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe change in accounting estimate as a result of our adoption of CECL increased the ACL as of January 1, 2020 to $62.6 million from the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 of $31.1 million. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $25.0 million, with corresponding adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments in addition to recording a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Included in our transition adjustment as of January 1, 2020 was the cumulative effect adjustment to gross-up the amortized cost amount of purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans by $0.6 million.\nWe utilize two methods to deliver mortgage loans sold to an investor. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell the loan when an interest rate-lock commitment is entered into with a customer, as described above. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, the Company is obligated to sell the mortgage loan to the investor only if the loan is closed and funded. Thus, the Company will not incur any liability to an investor if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. The Company also utilizes mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreements. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor should the Company fail to satisfy the contract. Mandatory commitments are recorded at fair value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of these commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line item Other noninterest income\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMortgage banking income primarily includes origination fees and realized gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans, unrealized change in fair value of mortgage loans and derivatives, and mortgage servicing fees, which includes net change in fair value of MSRs and related derivatives. Mortgage banking income is initially driven by the recognition of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) at fair value at inception of the IRLCs. This is subsequently adjusted for changes in the overall interest rate environment offset by derivative contracts entered into to mitigate the interest rate exposure. Upon sale of the loan, the net fair value gain is reclassified as a realized gain on sale. Mortgage banking income was $255.3 million and $100.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a 153.0% increase year-over-year.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $4.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in equity securities recorded at fair value that primarily consisted of mutual funds. The change in the fair value of equity securities resulted in a net gain of $296.5 thousand and $148.0 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n\nIn order to operate with a sound risk profile, we focus on originating loans that we believe to be of high quality. We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions, including extensions or interest rate modifications, to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans, which can result in us carrying higher nonperforming assets. We believe this practice leads to higher recoveries in the long-term.\nOther real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in addition to excess facilities held for sale. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Reductions in the carrying value subsequent to foreclosure are charged to earnings and are included in Gain on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2020, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $1.8 million, which combined with gains on sales of other real estate, resulted in net losses of $1.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, other real estate owned included write-downs and partial liquidations of $0.5 million, which combined with net gains on sales of other real estate owned, resulted in a net gain $0.5 million.\nThroughout the following discussion of our operating results, we present our net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis. The fully tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, which enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we initiated a credit line in the amount of $20.0 million (1.75% + 1 month LIBOR in effect 2 business days prior to reprice date) and borrowed $15.0 million against the line to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National transaction. An additional $5.0 million remains available for the Company to draw. This line of credit has a term of one year and matured subsequent to December 31, 2020 on February 21, 2021.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, we may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters.\nNoninterest expense\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $151.2 million and $51.7 million of delinquent GNMA loans that had previously been sold; however, we determined there not to be a more-than-trivial benefit of rebooking based on an analysis of interest rates and an assessment of potential reputational risk associated with these loans. As such, these were not recorded on our balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nSee the section captioned \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" for more information regarding the Company's ACL methodology.\nWe continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits.\nCommercial real estate owner-occupied loans. Our commercial real estate owner-occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate owner occupied properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, production facilities, health care facilities, retail centers, restaurants, churches and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower, and hence are dependent on the success of the underlying business for repayment and are more exposed to general economic conditions.\n(1)Includes $212,645 of loans originated as part of the PPP at December 31, 2020, established by the CARES Act, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is administered by the SBA; loans originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules.\nSee also Risk factors: Legal, regulatory and compliance risk\u201d.\nResidential line of credit loans. Our residential line of credit loans are primarily revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential properties. We intend to continue to make residential line of credit loans if housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. Residential line of credit loans may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nAdditionally, the Bank maintains a line with the Federal Reserve Bank through the Borrower-in-Custody program. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $2.46 billion and $1.41 billion of qualifying loans and $0.0 million and $5.0 million of investment securities were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank, securing a line of credit of $1,695.6 million and $1,013.2 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared and paid dividends of 0.36 per share, or $14.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared and paid dividends of $0.32 per share, or $10.2 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.11 per share, payable on February 22, 2021, to stockholders of record as of February 8, 2021.\nThe provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") at an appropriate level under the current expected credit loss model. The determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. We adopted the expected credit loss methodology under FASB ASC Topic 326 on January 1, 2020. The change in methodology from the previous incurred loss model in place prior to adoption requires additional inputs and the use of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to estimate loan losses for the entire life of the loan portfolio. As such, the results between models are not necessarily comparable. Refer to Note 1, \"Basis of presentation\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion regarding ACL methodology.\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. We continue to focus on growing core customer deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy, community-focused marketing programs, and initiatives such as the development of our treasury management services.\nResidential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. Our residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, including manufactured homes with real estate, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. We intend to continue to make residential 1-4 family housing loans at a similar pace, so long as housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. First lien residential 1-4 family mortgages may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.\nExcluding the impact of our merger and acquisition activities, as well as the PPP loans included in loans held for investment, total assets increased 16.0%, total loans decreased 3.4%, and total deposits increased 24.2%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\nThe Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company's main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company's ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see the Item 1. Business - Supervision and regulation,\u201d \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks related to our business\" and \" Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy,\" each of which is set forth in our Annual Report.\nOur investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, securities with a carrying value of $804.8 million and $373.7 million, respectively, were pledged to secure government, public, trust and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings, letters of credit and derivative instruments. Additionally, we have a FHLB letter of credit to secure public funds totaling $100.0 million and $75.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are a financial holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. We operate primarily through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, FirstBank, the third largest bank headquartered in Tennessee, based on total assets. FirstBank provides a comprehensive suite of commercial and consumer banking services to clients in select markets in Tennessee, North Alabama, Southern Kentucky, and North Georgia. As of December 31, 2020, our footprint included 81 full-service branches serving the following Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Areas ( MSAs\u201d): Nashville, Chattanooga (including North Georgia), Knoxville, Memphis, and Jackson in addition to Bowling Green, Kentucky and Florence and Huntsville, Alabama. We also provide banking services to 16 community markets throughout Tennessee and North Georgia. FirstBank also provides mortgage banking services utilizing its bank branch network and mortgage banking offices strategically located throughout the southeastern United States in addition to a national internet delivery channel. As of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $11.21 billion, loans held for investment of $7.08 billion, total deposits of $9.46 billion, and total shareholders' equity of $1.29 billion.\nWhen credit losses are expected to occur, the amount of the expected credit loss recognized in earnings depends on our intention to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the expected credit loss recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the date it was determined to be impaired due to credit losses or other factors. The previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.\n\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing and was the original transferor. At the servicer's option and without GNMA's prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100 percent of the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing,\u201d this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When we are deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans held for investment, regardless of whether we intend to exercise the buy-back option if the buyback option provides the transferor a more-than-trivial benefit. When repurchased, after meeting certain performance criteria, the loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value and are able to be repooled into a new Ginnie Mae guaranteed security.\nOur noninterest expense includes primarily salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense, legal and professional fees, data processing expense, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, advertising and promotion and other real estate owned expense, among others. We monitor the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, which is commonly known as the efficiency ratio.\nThe principal categories of our loans held for investment portfolio are discussed below:\nLoans held for sale\nOur loan portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 63.2% and 72.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. Our overall lending approach is primarily focused on providing credit to our customers directly rather than purchasing loan syndications and loan participations from other banks (collectively, participated loans\u201d). At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans held for investment included approximately $206.8 million and $103.4 million, respectively, related to purchased participation loans. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations.\n(4)Includes $0.4 million accretion on subordinated debt fair value premium for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $170.4 million and $31.1 million and represented 2.41% and 0.71% of loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Excluding PPP loans with a recorded investment totaling $212.6 million, our ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment would have been 7 basis points higher\n(1) This category was added in 2020. Loans considered \"Doubtful\" were included as part of the \"Substandard\" risk category prior to January 1, 2020.\nThe adjustment to convert certain income to a tax-equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and blended state statutory income tax rate of 26.06% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe consider the need to qualitatively adjust our modeled quantitative expected credit loss estimate for information not already captured in the model loss estimation process. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease our estimate of expected credit losses. We review the qualitative adjustments so as to validate that information that has already been considered and included in the modeled quantitative loss estimation process is not also included in the qualitative adjustment. We consider the qualitative factors that are relevant to the institution as of the reporting date, which may include, but are not limited to: levels of and trends in delinquencies and performance of loans; levels of and trends in write-offs and recoveries collected; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in reasonable and supportable economic forecasts; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; available relevant information sources that contradict our own forecast; effects of changes in prepayment expectations or other factors affecting assessments of loan contractual term; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.\n\nITEM 7 - Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nloss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded, unless considered derivatives.\nOur deposit base also includes certain commercial and high net worth individuals that periodically place deposits with the Bank for short periods of time and can cause fluctuations from period to period in the overall level of customer deposits outstanding. These fluctuations may include certain deposits from related parties as disclosed within Note 25, \"Related party transactions\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Management continues to focus on growing noninterest-bearing deposits while allowing more costly funding sources to mature, repricing downward in our current lower interest rate conditions.\nEquity securities with readily determinable market values are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with any periodic changes in value made through adjustments to the statement of income. Equity securities without readily determinable market values are carried at cost less impairment and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAsset quality\n(4)Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a U.S. federal income tax rate and, where applicable, state income tax to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table were $2.8 million, $1.9 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations' implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.\nIn connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate expected credit loss, the Company considers the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions. As such, the Company recorded provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor additional information regarding credit quality risk factors for our Company, see Business: Risk management: Credit risk management\u201d and Risk factors: Credit Risks.\u201d\nDiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in the respective sections within \"Part II. Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of operations\" of our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCapital management and regulatory capital requirements\nThe following table sets forth the balance and associated percentage of each class of financing receivable in our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nThe tax-equivalent yield on loans held for investment was 4.95%, down 109 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in yield was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and was also impacted by lower-yielding PPP loans originated during the period. Contractual loan interest rates yielded 4.57% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 5.50% in the year ended December 31, 2019. PPP loans contribute 14 basis points of this decline in contractual loan yield.\nThe following table sets forth our time deposits segmented by months to maturity and deposit amount as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and other miscellaneous non-earning assets. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. In our loan review process, we seek to identify and proactively address nonperforming loans.\nInvestment securities\nWe are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk Policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements and otherwise sustain our operations. We accomplish this through management of the maturities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs.\nOur investment portfolio objectives include maximizing total return after other primary objectives are achieved such as, but not limited to, providing liquidity, capital preservation, and pledging collateral for various types of borrowings. The investment objectives guide the portfolio allocation among securities types, maturities, and other attributes.\nWe focus on originating quality loans and have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in upholding the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. However, credit trends in the markets in which we operate and in our loan portfolio can materially impact our financial condition and performance and are primarily driven by the economic conditions in our markets.\n\nThe following table sets forth our ROAA, ROAE, dividend payout ratio and average shareholders' equity to average assets ratio for the periods indicated:\nWe utilize probability-weighted forecasts, which consider multiple macroeconomic variables from a third-party vendor that are applicable to the type of loan. The choice and weighting of the economic forecast scenarios, macroeconomic variables, and the reasonable and supportable period at the macroeconomic variable-level are reviewed and approved by the forecast governance committee based on expectations of future economic conditions.\nThe transaction added a new subsidiary to the Company, FirstBank Risk Management (\"FBRM\"), which provides risk management services to the Company in the form of enhanced insurance coverages. It also added a new subsidiary to the Bank, FirstBank Investments of Tennessee, Inc. (\"FBIT\"), which provides investment services to the Bank. FBIT has a wholly owned subsidiary, FirstBank Investments of Nevada, Inc. (\"FBIN\") to provide investment services to FBIT. FBIN has a controlling interest in a subsidiary, FirstBank Preferred Capital, Inc. (\"FBPC\"), which serves as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), to allow the Bank to sell real estate loans to the REIT to obtain a tax benefit.\n\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $103.4 million and $68.0 million, respectively. This increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 is mainly attributable to a continued increase in business activity and the result of a conducive interest rate environment for refinancing during the period, which led to an increase in related commissions and incentives expenses.\n\nNoninterest income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, generally comprising over 50% of our total revenues in a given period. Net interest income and margin are shaped by many factors, primarily the volume, term structure and mix of earning assets, funding mechanisms, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In response to economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve remains committed to using all available tools to support the economy and uphold their\nOur total assets grew by 83.0% to $11.21 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.12 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects additions through acquisitions amounting to $3.63 billion and $258.2 million from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, which closed on August 15, 2020 and February 14, 2020, respectively. Loans held for investment increased $2.67 billion to $7.08 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.41 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for investment for the year ended 2020 includes $2.43 billion and $182.2 million of loans acquired from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively, as well as $212.6 million of PPP loans outstanding as part of the CARES Act.\nOther noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $8.2 million to $15.3 million as compared to other noninterest income of $7.1 million for year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects a gain on commercial loans held for sale of $3.2 million related to changes in fair value from Franklin acquisition date to the end of 2020. Additionally, the increase reflect reflects increased swap fee income in addition to overall increases due to our growth and volume of business.\nDuring 2019, we made a strategic decision to sell our wholesale mortgage operations, which comprise the third party origination (\"TPO\") and correspondent mortgage delivery channels. The exit of the two wholesale channels better aligns the Mortgage segment with our strategic plan and long-term vision for the Company. This has also allowed additional focus on our retail and Consumer Direct origination channels. In connection with the mortgage restructuring, the Company incurred related expenses, including $0.1 million attributed to the relief of goodwill, totaling $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.8 million to $135.4 million from $130.6 million from the same period in the previous year. The increase in noninterest income was largely a result of an increase in ATM and interchange fees related to our growth and volume of business.\nOur net income increased by 4.46% in 2019 to $83.8 million from $80.2 million in 2018. Pre-tax net income increased by $3.7 million, or 3.48%, from $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.65 and $2.55 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our net income represented a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.45% and 1.66% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a return on average shareholders' equity, or ROAE, of 11.6% and 12.7% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our ratio of return on average tangible common equity (\"ROATCE\") for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 15.4% and 16.7%, respectively.\nThe following tables set forth information related to the credit quality of our loan portfolio as of the dates presented.\nCredit trends\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $166.5 million to $301.9 million, up from $135.4 million for prior year period. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage banking income of $154.4 million to $255.3 million.\nWe also assumed two issues of subordinated debt, totaling $60,000, as part of the Franklin merger. The notes, issued in 2016, feature $40,000 of 6.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due March 30, 2026 (\"March 2026 Subordinated Notes\"), and $20,000 of 7% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due July 1, 2026 (\"July 2026 Subordinated Notes\"). Upon acquisition, we recorded a $0.8 million fair value premium adjustment, and during 2020, we recognized $0.4 million of amortization expense. Both note issuances currently pay interest semi-annually, and will begin resetting interest rates on a quarterly basis after March 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021. For years six through ten, interest for the March 2026 Subordinated Notes will based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 5.636% and interest for the July 2026 Subordinated Notes will be based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 6.04%.
