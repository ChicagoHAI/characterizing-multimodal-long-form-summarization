MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As Ashland Global Holdings Inc. is the successor to Ashland Inc., the information set forth refers to Ashland Inc. for the periods prior to September 30, 2016 and to Ashland Global Holdings Inc. on and after September 30, 2016.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nAshland profile\nAshland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets, including adhesives, architectural coatings, automotive, construction, energy, food and beverage, personal care and pharmaceutical. With approximately 6,500 employees worldwide, Ashland serves customers in more than 100 countries.\nAshland's sales generated outside of North America were 60% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Sales by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nSales by Geography\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America (a)\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America & other\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Reportable segments\nAshland's reporting structure is composed of three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. For further descriptions of each reportable segment, see Results of Operations - Reportable Segment Review\u201d beginning on page M-13.\nSales by each reportable segment expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nSales by Reportable Segment\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Ingredients\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composites\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediates and Solvents\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\nDuring 2017, the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on Ashland's current and future cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness results\nAshland's net income was $28 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $28 million in 2016. Ashland's Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5% during 2017 compared to 2016 to $570 million (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation on page M-7). The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to declines in the Unallocated and other reportable segment, where there was a $63 million decrease in pension and other postretirement income in 2017 resulting from the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016. In addition, the prior year included $22 million of previously allocated corporate costs to Valvoline. Excluding these two items, Adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $13 million, or 2%. Reviewing the operational Adjusted EBITDA performance, both Specialty Ingredients and Composites slightly increased while I&S slightly decreased compared to 2016.\nThe following discussion outlines significant transactions announced or executed during 2017.\nM-1\nAshland Separation of Valvoline\nOn September 22, 2015, Ashland announced that the Board of Directors approved proceeding with a plan to separate Ashland into two independent, publicly traded companies comprising of the new Ashland (now known as Ashland Global Holdings Inc.) and Valvoline Inc. The initial step of the separation, the initial public offering (IPO) of Valvoline Inc., closed on September 28, 2016. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriters' discount and other offering expenses received from the IPO were $712 million, which were used primarily to repay debt incurred prior to the IPO and retained for Valvoline Inc.'s cash on hand. As discussed further within the Final Separation section, Ashland completed the distribution of its remaining shares in Valvoline Inc. on May 12, 2017. The new Ashland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets. Key markets and applications include pharmaceutical, personal care, food and beverage, architectural coatings, adhesives, automotive, construction and energy.\nAfter completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares on May 12, 2017, Ashland owned 170 million shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock which represented approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock. As a result, Ashland continued to consolidate Valvoline within the Consolidated Financial Statements up until the distribution of the remaining shares. The resulting outside stockholders' interests in Valvoline Inc., which was approximately 17% as of September 30, 2016, was presented separately as a noncontrolling interest within Ashland's equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributed to these previous minority holders was presented as a separate caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nFinal Separation\nAshland completed the distribution of its remaining 170 million shares of common stock of Valvoline Inc. as a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017. Based on the shares of Ashland common stock outstanding as of May 5, 2017, the record date for the distribution, each share of Ashland common stock received 2.745338 shares of Valvoline common stock in the distribution. The distribution was recorded at the carrying amount of Valvoline Inc.'s net assets which was a deficit of $187 million as of May 12, 2017.\nA Tax Matters Agreement between Ashland and Valvoline Inc. governs the rights and obligations after the spin-off regarding certain income taxes and other taxes, including certain tax liabilities and benefits, attributes, returns and contests.\nDiscontinued Operations Assessment\nValvoline met the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation and accordingly, its assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note E within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Valvoline reportable segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and continue to be reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were $22 million and $23 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts of transaction\nAshland recognized separation costs of $95 million and $88 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are primarily related to transaction, consulting and legal fees. During 2017 and 2016, $13 million and $7 million, respectively, of the separation costs directly related to Valvoline were included within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. Otherwise, separation costs are recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nNew Reportable Segments\nSubsequent to completing the distribution of Valvoline Inc. during the current year, Ashland's operations are now managed within the following three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\nPharmachem Acquisition\nBackground\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem Laboratories, Inc. (Pharmachem), a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and\nM-2\nMexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. Ashland has included Pharmachem within the Specialty Ingredients reporting segment.\nPurchase price allocation\nThe acquisition was recorded by Ashland using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on respective fair values.\nThe all-cash purchase price of Pharmachem was $680 million which included working capital adjustments of approximately $20 million. Ashland incurred $5 million of transaction costs during 2017 related to the acquisition, which was recorded within the net loss on acquisitions and divestitures caption in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nFinancing Activities\n2017 Credit Agreement\nOn May 17, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Pharmachem acquisition, Ashland entered into a secured credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. On May 19, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility from $680 million to $800 million.\nAt Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate). The TLA Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Three-Year TLA Facility will not amortize and will be due on May 17, 2020. The Five-Year TLA Facility will not amortize in each of the first, second and third years and will amortize at a rate of 20% per annum in each of the fourth and fifth years (payable in equal quarterly installments), with the outstanding balance of the Five-Year TLA Facility to be paid on May 17, 2022.\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility). At Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 TLB Facility bear interest at either (x) LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum. The 2017 TLB Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium if the prepayment is made on or prior to December 14, 2017 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement). The 2017 TLB Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00% per annum (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the outstanding balance to be paid on May 17, 2024.\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nM-3\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\nAccounts receivable securitization\nDuring the December 2015 quarter, the Transfer and Administration Agreement was amended to extend the termination date of the accounts receivable securitization facility from December 31, 2015 to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement. No other changes to the agreement within the current or prior year amendments are expected to have a significant impact to Ashland's results of operations and financial position.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED REVIEW\nUse of non-GAAP measures\nAshland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>EBITDA - net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for noncontrolling interests, discontinued operations, net gain (loss) on acquisitions and divestitures, other income and (expense) and key items (including the remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA, which can include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) - income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Free cash flow - operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Management believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nM-4\nprovide Ashland's investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by Ashland's management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashland's historical operating performance and its business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashland's management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.\nThe free cash flow metric enables Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for items that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashland's 2017 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions, for example, the life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the expected return on pension plan assets yet excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses, provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance (see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table on page M-7 for additional details on exact amounts included within this non-GAAP measure related to pension and other postretirement plans.) Management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (and in particular interest rates) that are not directly related to the underlying business. For further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated review\nNet income (loss)\nAshland's net income (loss) is primarily affected by results within operating income, net interest and other financing expense, net loss on acquisitions and divestitures, income taxes, discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring.

Water Technologies activity during 2015 related primarily to income of $5 million due to a foreign pension plan remeasurement discussed in Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as other post-closing adjustments.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince Ashland's ownership interest in Valvoline Inc. was approximately 83% after completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares of Valvoline on May 12, 2017, the amount of net income attributable to the outside stockholders' approximately 17% noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc. was presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP within this caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2017 and 2016.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nA comparative analysis of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) is provided below for the last three fiscal years ended September 30.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(net of taxes)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized translation gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, increased $75 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of the following components.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In 2017, the unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency translation adjustments was income of $81 million, compared to a loss of $14 million during 2016.

In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\nResults of Ashland's reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashland's reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded to Unallocated and other. Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashland's methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis.\nThe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment. Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items, which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures, as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA, which may include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.\nThe following table shows sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization and statistical operating information by reportable segment for each of the last three years ended September 30.\nM-13\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

It offers industry-leading products, technologies and resources for solving formulation and product-performance challenges. Specialty Ingredients uses natural, synthetic and semisynthetic polymers derived from cellulose ethers, vinyl pyrrolidones, acrylic polymers, polyester and polyurethane-based adhesives, and plant and seed extract. Specialty Ingredient' end markets offer comprehensive and innovative solutions for today's demanding consumer and industrial applications. Key customers include: pharmaceutical companies; makers of personal care products, food and beverages; makers of nutraceuticals and supplements; manufacturers of paint, coatings and construction materials; packaging and converting; and oilfield service companies.\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem, a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAshland completed the transfer of its ownership interest in a consolidated joint venture during 2017 and sold the industrial biocides assets during 2015. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures.\n2017 compared to 2016\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales increased $127 million, or 6%, to $2,216 million in 2017. The acquisition of Pharmachem in the current year increased sales by $104 million, or 5%, while a toller agreement exit and the divestiture of a joint venture combined to decrease sales by $13 million. Volume increased sales by $72 million as metric tons increased to 317.2 thousand in 2017, while mix declined sales by $32 million during the current fiscal year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $10 million, while improved product pricing increased sales by $6 million.\nGross profit during 2017 increased $18 million compared to 2016. The acquisition of Pharmachem in 2017 increased gross profit by $32 million while improved volume and mix combined to increase gross profit by $21 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to pricing and higher costs of $29 million, which included a $32 million impact from the following key items during 2017 and 2016:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$17 million of restructuring charges related the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility during 2017 (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7 million of noncash charges related to the fair value assessment of inventory acquired from Pharmachem at the date of acquisition during 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$6 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a hurricane during 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1 million of net restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility during 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nM-15\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment during 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and the divestiture of a joint ventures decreased gross profit by $4 million and $2 million, respectively. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 1.2 percentage points to 32.7% as compared to 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (which includes research and development expenses throughout the reportable segment discussion and analysis) increased $20 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to incremental costs of $17 million related to Pharmachem's operations. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $2 million compared to 2016.\nOperating income totaled $233 million for 2017 compared to $237 million in 2016. EBITDA decreased $14 million to $462 million in 2017, while Adjusted EBITDA increased $17 million to $493 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2017 to 22.2%.\n2016 compared to 2015\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales decreased $174 million, or 8%, to $2,089 million in 2016. Energy market sales decreased $55 million compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volume as a result of reduced demand by customers, specifically those within industries negatively impacted by a low oil price environment. In addition, pricing declines reduced sales by $45 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets and the exit from the redispersible powders product line decreased sales by $24 million and $11 million, respectively. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and changes in volume and product mix combined decreased sales by $27 million and $12 million, respectively.\nGross profit during 2016 decreased $26 million compared to 2015. Gross profit included certain key items during 2016 and 2015 as follows:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>as part of a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, 2016 included a net $1 million of restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation, while 2015 included severance and other costs of $17 million and accelerated depreciation of $6 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 included $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment while 2015 included a $13 million charge related to a customer claim.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, gross profit within the energy market decreased $17 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of lower volumes. The remaining gross profit decline of $47 million compared to 2015 was partially due to planned plant turnarounds, which reduced gross profit by $19 million during 2016, while lower costs, primarily raw materials, was offset by pricing declines. Volume and changes in product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $13 million while unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross profit by $11 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets decreased gross profit by $4 million during 2016. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 1.5 percentage points to 33.9% as compared to 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $24 million, or 5%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $11 million impairment of IPR&D assets within research and development expenses during 2015 and favorable foreign currency exchange of $8 million. Inflationary increases were offset by other savings initiatives. Equity and other income (loss) remained consistent compared to 2015.\nOperating income totaled $237 million for 2016 compared to $239 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $1 million to $476 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $51 million to $476 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2016 to 22.8%.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\nThe following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Specialty Ingredients. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items. The key items within the current year related to $17 million restructuring charges for the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation and $3 million of severance and other restructuring costs), $7 million for the revaluation of Pharmachem inventory, $6 million of charges related to an unplanned plant shutdown and $1 million of severance costs. The prior year included $4 million of restructuring charges, partially offset by a $5 million income adjustment to a severance accrual, while 2015 included $17 million of severance and other costs related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan during 2015. The $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan. The $13 million adjustment during 2015 related to a customer claim which was subsequently adjusted by $5 million during 2016. There were environmental reserve adjustments of $2 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impairment of $11 million during 2015 relates to certain in-process research and development assets associated with a previous acquisition.\nM-16\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (a)\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and other costs\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accelerated depreciation\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unplanned plant shutdown\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental reserve adjustment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer claim\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of IPR&D assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Excludes $14 million, $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComposites\nComposites is a global leader in unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl ester resins and gelcoats.

For additional information on the divestiture of the Elastomers division, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2017 compared to 2016\nComposites' sales increased $110 million to $779 million in 2017. Volume increased sales by $59 million, or 9%, as metric tons increased to 346.4 thousand in 2017. Improved product pricing increased sales by $35 million, or 5%, while the acquisition of an unsaturated polyester resins manufacturing facility in the current year increased sales by $22 million, or 3%. Unfavorable product mix decreased sales by $6 million.\nGross profit increased $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Volume increased gross profit by $15 million while the impact of the manufacturing facility acquisition increased gross profit by $2 million. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $10 million and unfavorable product mix decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 2.8 percentage points to 19.8% as compared to 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $3 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $2 million and a reduction in bad debt expense of $2 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $2 million compared to 2016.\nOperating income totaled $67 million in 2017 compared to $63 million in 2016. EBITDA increased $4 million to $89 million in 2017, while the EBITDA margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 11.4% in 2017.\n2016 compared to 2015\nComposites' sales decreased $165 million, or 20%, to $669 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $66 million, or 8%, and the divestiture of the Elastomers division resulted in a loss of sales of $40 million, or 5%. Lower volume decreased sales by $30 million, or 4%, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $20 million, or 2%. Changes in product mix decreased sales by $9 million.\nGross profit decreased $9 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume and product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $11 million while pricing effects were more than offset by lower costs, increasing gross profit by $10 million. The sale of Elastomers and unfavorable foreign currency exchange each decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 3.4 percentage points as compared to 2015 to 22.6%.\nM-17\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $12 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $6 million, the sale of the Elastomers division of $3 million and favorable foreign currency exchange of $3 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $1 million during 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating income totaled $63 million in 2016 compared to $61 million in 2015.

Butanediol is also supplied to Ashland's Specialty Ingredients business for use as a raw material.\n2017 compared to 2016\nIntermediates and Solvents' sales increased $4 million to $265 million in 2017. The net impact of volume and product pricing increased sales by $7 million with metric tons sold increasing to 137.0 thousand. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower product pricing, which decreased sales by $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\nGross profit decreased $12 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $12 million, which included the impact of higher facility turn around costs of $9 million and incremental costs of $7 million related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a fire. Higher volumes increased gross profit by $2 million which was offset by unfavorable product mix of $2 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 4.5 percentage points to 6.5%.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $181 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to the non-cash long lived asset impairment recorded during 2016.

The significant decline in operating cash flow during 2015 related primarily to $610 million of pension contributions, which included a $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution made in June 2015 for plans impacted by a pension settlement program. The $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution was primarily related to Ashland's largest U.S. qualified pension plan which has since been transferred to Valvoline as discussed within Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Activities - Operating Assets and Liabilities\nExcluding the voluntary pension contribution in 2015, the cash results during each year were primarily driven by net income, excluding discontinued operation results, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization (including debt issuance cost amortization), losses on acquisitions and divestitures as well as changes in working capital, which are fluctuations within accounts receivable, inventory, trade payables and accrued expenses. Ashland continues to emphasize working capital management as a high priority and focus.\nThe following details certain changes in key operating assets and liabilities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from assets and liabilities (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade and other payables\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in net working capital accounted for an outflow of $27 million in 2017 and inflows of $26 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were driven by the following:\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accounts receivable - Changes in accounts receivable resulted in a $64 million outflow of cash in 2017 compared to cash inflows of $77 million and $211 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Debt as a percent of capital employed was 45% at September 30, 2017 and 44% at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2017, Ashland's total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $2,897 million, discounts of $53 million, and debt issuance costs of $25 million. The scheduled aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the next five fiscal years (including the current portion and excluding debt issuance costs) are as follows: $6 million in 2018, $11 million in 2019, $269 million in 2020, $56 million in 2021 and $1,279 million in 2022.\nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\n2017 Credit Agreement\nOn May 17, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Pharmachem acquisition, Ashland entered into a secured credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. On May 19, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility from $680 million to $800 million.\nAt Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate). The TLA Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Three-Year TLA Facility will not amortize and will be due on May 17, 2020. The Five-Year TLA Facility will not amortize in each of the first, second and third years and will amortize at a rate of 20% per annum in each of the fourth and fifth years (payable in equal quarterly installments), with the outstanding balance of the Five-Year TLA Facility to be paid on May 17, 2022.\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility). At Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 TLB Facility bear interest at either (x) LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum. The 2017 TLB Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium if the prepayment is made on or prior to December 14, 2017 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement). The 2017 TLB Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00% per annum (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the outstanding balance to be paid on May 17, 2024.\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nM-25\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nSenior notes refinancing, 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and 2016 Amendment\nDuring June of 2015, Ashland completed certain refinancing transactions related to the $600 million 3.000% senior notes due in 2016 (2016 Senior Notes). Ashland commenced and completed a cash tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 2016 Senior Notes. At the close of the tender offer, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes was tendered by note holders, representing approximately 92% of the outstanding 2016 Senior Notes, which have been purchased by Ashland. Subsequently, Ashland redeemed the remaining balance of the 2016 Senior Notes of $50 million on July 23, 2015.\nIn connection with the tender offer and redemption, in June 2015, Ashland entered into a new Credit Agreement (the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement replaced the $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 Senior Credit Facility), and was comprised of a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility), which included a $250 million letter of credit sublimit and a $100 million swing line loan sublimit, and a five-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the 2015 term loan facility). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement was not guaranteed, was unsecured and could be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.\nAt Ashland's option, borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The loans' interest rate fluctuated between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.50% per annum), based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility through and including June 30, 2015, and thereafter the fee rate fluctuated between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee rate).\nDuring 2015, Ashland used the proceeds from borrowings under the $1.1 billion term loan facility along with cash on hand (i) to fund the tender offer of the 2016 Senior Notes, (ii) to prepay in full the outstanding loans under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, (iii) to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the 2016 Senior Notes, (iv) to contribute funds to the U.S. pension plans impacted by the pension plan settlement program, and (v) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the entry into the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement. As a result of the tender offer and redemption, Ashland recognized a $9 million charge related to early redemption premium payments, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2015.\nAshland incurred $10 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2015 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance was amortized over the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the repayment of the 2016 Senior Notes, Ashland recognized a $2 million charge during 2015 for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nDuring July 2016, Ashland amended the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement to permit the Reorganization and the series of events relating to the separation of Valvoline Inc. Additionally, the amendment provided that if the aggregate principal amount of the Valvoline debt reaches $750 million, Ashland would be required to use the net proceeds of such borrowings to repay the 2015 term loan facility and/or permanently reduce its existing revolving credit commitments under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. As a result of the July 2016 amendment and the Valvoline debt borrowings in connection with the separation, Ashland reduced its revolving borrowing capacity to $800 million.\nThe 2015 Term Loan Facility balance was repaid in full in connection with the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities during September 2016. In connection with these transactions, Ashland recognized a $6 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2016.\nM-26\nOther Financing Activities\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nAccounts receivable securitization\nOn August 31, 2012, Ashland entered into a $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to (i) a Sale Agreement, among Ashland and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an Originator and collectively, the Originators) and CVG Capital III LLC, a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote\u201d special purpose subsidiary of the Originators (CVG) and (ii) a Transfer and Administration Agreement, among CVG, each Originator, Ashland, as Master Servicer, certain Conduit Investors, Uncommitted Investors, Letter of Credit Issuers, Managing Agents, Administrators and Committed Investors, and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as agent for various secured parties (the Agent). The Transfer and Administration Agreement had a term of three years, but was extendable at the discretion of Ashland and the Investors. During 2016, the termination date of the commitments under the Transfer and Administration Agreement was extended from December 31, 2015, the previous termination extension date, to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement.\nUnder the Sale Agreement, each Originator will transfer, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable, certain related assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to CVG. Under the terms of the Transfer and Administration Agreement, CVG could, from time to time, obtain up to $350 million (in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of Ashland and its subsidiaries) from the Conduit Investors, the Uncommitted Investors and/or the Committed Investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable, related assets and collections. Subsequently during 2014 and 2015, the available funding for qualifying receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $350 million to $275 million during 2014 and from $275 million to $250 million during 2015 due to the divestitures that occurred during the fiscal years. The accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $250 million to $100 million when Valvoline was removed as an Originator as part of the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities in September 2016. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Transfer and Administration Agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily reinvestments) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Originators and transferred to CVG, with settlement generally occurring monthly. Ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to CVG, the accounts receivable, related assets and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Originator's own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Originator become insolvent. Substantially all of CVG's assets have been pledged to the Agent in support of its obligations under the Transfer and Administration Agreement.\nAt September 30, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to CVG was $155 million and $133 million, respectively. There were $56 million of borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2017, while Ashland had no borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2016. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 2.8% for 2017 and 1.5% for 2016.\nM-27\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\nAshland debt covenant restrictions\nAshland's debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashland's most recent credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) is 4.50. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2017 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, noncash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page M-7. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker's acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees.\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2017 Credit Agreement during is 3.0. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period.\nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.8, which is below the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement of 4.50. At September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 4.7, which exceeds the minimum required consolidated ratio of 3.0.\nAny change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.5x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 0.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated net leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.\nAshland credit ratings\nAshland's corporate credit rating with Standard & Poor's is BB, while Moody's Investor Services is Ba2. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's outlooks both remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings may have an effect on Ashland's borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.\nAdditional capital resources\nAshland cash projection\nAshland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable Ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations. These projections are based on various assumptions that include, but are not limited to: operational results, capital expenditures, working capital needs and tax payment and receipts.\nTotal Equity\nTotal equity increased $241 million since September 30, 2016 to $3,406 million at September 30, 2017. The increase of $241 million was primarily due to $187 million related to the distribution of Valvoline Inc., $27 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc., $81 million related to deferred translation gains, $15 million for common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans and $15 million of a net change in the gain on available-for-sale securities. These increases were partially offset by $77 million of regular cash dividends.\nStock repurchase programs\nDuring 2015, Ashland's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization (the 2015 stock repurchase program) that was set to expire on December 31, 2017. This authorization allows for common shares to be repurchased in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or Rule 10b5-1 plans.\nM-28\nDuring 2017, Ashland's Board of Directors extended this $1 billion share repurchase authorization indefinitely. As further described in the stock repurchase program agreements section below, there is $500 million currently remaining on this authorization.\nStock repurchase program agreements\nIn November 2015, under the 2015 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2016 ASR Agreement) with Goldman Sachs & Co. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $500 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock during November 2015. In February 2016, Goldman Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 2016 ASR Agreement and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $99.01 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by Goldman Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASR Agreement was 5.1 million shares. Ashland received the additional 1.2 million shares during 2016 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased. After the 2016 ASR Agreement, $500 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the 2015 stock repurchase authorization.\nDuring 2015, Ashland announced and completed accelerated share repurchase agreements (2015 ASR Agreements) with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan to repurchase an aggregate of $270 million of Ashland's common stock. Under the 2015 ASR Agreements, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $270 million, split evenly between the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock. The 2015 ASR Agreements had a variable maturity, at the financial institutions option, with a maximum pricing period termination date of July 31, 2015. During 2015, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan exercised their early termination option under the 2015 ASR Agreements and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $125.22 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by the financial institutions under the 2015 ASR Agreements was 2.2 million shares. Ashland received the additional 0.3 million shares from the financial institutions during 2015 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased.\nStockholder dividends\nDuring May 2017, subsequent to the final distribution of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock, the Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 22.5 cents per share to eligible shareholders at record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 and represents a reduction from the previous quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share.\nIn May 2015, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to 39 cents per share to eligible shareholders of record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, each quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015.

These arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. Ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nM-30\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on Ashland, see Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of Ashland's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), income taxes, liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashland's Board of Directors.\nLong-lived assets\nTangible assets\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 12 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Ashland reviews property, plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not limited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group, or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property, plant and equipment asset groups, as well as specific appraisals in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property, plant and equipment asset groups. If the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Various factors that Ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups, and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment asset groups, there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods.\nTotal depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $219 million, $226 million and $228 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included $19 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, in accelerated depreciation. Capitalized interest for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $1 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 25 years, intellectual property over 5 to 25 years and customer and supplier relationships over 3 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis.\nAmortization expense recognized on finite-lived intangible assets was $82 million for 2017, $76 million for 2016 and $78 million for 2015, and is primarily included in the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nGoodwill\nAshland reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The annual assessment is performed as of July 1 and consists of Ashland determining each reporting unit's current fair value compared to its current carrying value. Ashland determined that its reporting units for the\nM-31\nallocation of goodwill are its three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. The reporting units changed from prior years due to Ashland completing the distribution of Valvoline during the current year.\nGoodwill associated with the reporting units as of September 30, 2017 was $2,315 million for Specialty Ingredients, $150 million for Composites, and zero for Intermediates and Solvents as a result of full impairment during 2016.\nAs part of the goodwill impairment assessment, Ashland compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its respective estimated fair value. Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those reporting units through the use of a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting unit's industry peer group. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions. Significant assumptions Ashland utilized in these models for the current year included: projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. The base models of future financial performance projections utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment reflect conservative assumptions on future operating performance as approved by Management and the Board of Directors. Ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization, and implied control premium, to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. Subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews.\nIf the comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value indicates that a reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value, it is adjusted to its calculated fair value and the adjustment represents the impairment charge.\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2017 annual assessment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment for Specialty Ingredients or Composites. Based on sensitivity analyses performed, a negative 1% change in the long-term growth factor and the weighted-average cost of capital assumption, which are key assumptions, would not have resulted in the carrying value of these reporting units to exceed their respective calculated fair value. Because the fair value results for these reporting units did not indicate a potential impairment existed, Ashland did not record any goodwill impairment for these reporting units during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified for any of these reporting units.\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2016 annual assessment of impairment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques determined that the carrying value of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit exceeded its fair value at July 1, 2016, which resulted in the reporting unit failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Ashland then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which involved, among other things, obtaining third-party appraisals of substantially all of Intermediates and Solvents' tangible and intangible assets. Based on the results of its goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016, Ashland recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is in addition to a $10 million impairment related to Intermediates and Solvents' property, plant and equipment, and resulted in a total $181 million impairment charge for Intermediates and Solvents during 2016.\nKey factors that affected Ashland's conclusion that an impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 included the continued deterioration in the butanediol commodity market during 2016. Market conditions for butanediol, a commodity chemical used in the production of polymers, solvents and fine chemicals, can vary significantly from year to year or even quarter to quarter. Throughout 2016, increasing levels of overcapacity for butanediol in the market, particularly in China, and the resulting weak pricing had a cumulating negative impact on the financial performance of the Intermediates and Solvents division. Butanediol commodity contract prices had fallen consistently during 2016. These factors contributed significantly to lower expected EBITDA results within the longer-term forecast period. Ashland prepares its annual forecast mid-August through October each year. As the 2016 forecast was developed, Ashland considered many factors when assessing the outlook for 2017 and beyond. Because of these factors, Ashland revised its forecasts down significantly, which ultimately led to the goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge for the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAshland assessed and summed the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. The calculated fair value for each reporting unit summed together exceeded Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date by approximately 25%. Ashland evaluated this implied control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions, noting the 25% implied control premium was below levels of other recent comparable transactions. Accordingly, Ashland believed that its calculated fair values for its reporting units was an appropriately conservative estimate of fair value for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment. If the implied control premium was not reasonable in light of this assessment, Ashland would reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and other assumptions as necessary.\nM-32\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names. These assets had a carrying value of $301 million as of September 30, 2017. Ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Ashland tests these assets using a relief-from-royalty\u201d valuation method compared to the carrying value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include, but are not limited to, such estimates as projected business results, growth rates, weighted-average cost of capital, and royalty rates. The assumptions utilized in the current year models are generally consistent with the prior year models. In conjunction with the July 1 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashland's models did not indicate any impairment, as each indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded their carrying values.\nAshland's assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, increase in Ashland's weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or other assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event. For further information, see Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome taxes\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashland's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashland's estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets Ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative income or loss. In addition, Ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nAsbestos litigation\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions, Ashland retained Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. (HR&A). The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, enacted legislation, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, HR&A estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nM-33\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $36 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $419 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $415 million at September 30, 2016.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nIn October 2012, Ashland and Hercules initiated various arbitration proceedings against Underwriters at Lloyd's, certain London companies and/or Chartis (AIG) member companies seeking to enforce these insurers' contractual obligations to provide indemnity for asbestos liabilities and defense costs under existing coverage-in-place agreements. In addition, Ashland and Hercules initiated a lawsuit in Kentucky state court against certain Berkshire Hathaway entities (National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc.) on grounds that these Berkshire Hathaway entities had wrongfully interfered with Underwriters' and Chartis' performance of their respective contractual obligations to provide asbestos coverage by directing the insurers to reduce and delay certain claim payments.\nOn January 13, 2015, Ashland and Hercules entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement related to certain insurance coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims with Underwriters at Lloyd's, certain London companies and Chartis (AIG) member companies, along with National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc., under which Ashland and Hercules received a total of $398 million. In exchange, all claims were released against these entities for past, present and future coverage obligations arising out of the asbestos coverage-in-place agreements that were the subject of the pending arbitration proceedings. In addition, as part of this settlement, Ashland and Hercules released all claims against National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc. in the Kentucky state court action. As a result, the arbitration proceedings and the Kentucky state court action have been terminated.\nAs a result of this settlement, Ashland recorded an after-tax gain of $120 million within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during 2015. The Ashland insurance receivable balance was also reduced as a result of this settlement by $227 million within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition, during 2015, Ashland placed $335 million of the settlement funds received into a renewable annual trust restricted for the purpose of paying for ongoing and future litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in conjunction with asbestos claims.\nAshland entered into settlement agreements totaling $5 million and $4 million with certain insurers during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in a reduction of the Ashland insurance receivable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the same amount.\nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $155 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims). Receivables from insurers amounted to $151 million at September 30, 2016. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $15 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nM-34\nHercules asbestos-related litigation\nHercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules' former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased by $16 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $323 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $321 million at September 30, 2016.\nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAs a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement previously described, Hercules resolved all disputes with Chartis (AIG) member companies under their existing coverage-in-place agreement for past, present and future Hercules asbestos claims. As a result, during 2015, a $22 million reduction in the insurance receivable balance within the Consolidated Balance Sheets was recorded.\nAs of September 30, 2017 and 2016, the receivables from insurers amounted to $68 million and $63 million, respectively. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $5 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, mortality rates, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 to 50 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $660 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $419 million) and approximately $510 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $323 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nM-35\nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2017, such locations included 82 waste treatment or disposal sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 126 current and former operating facilities (including certain operating facilities conveyed as part of the MAP Transaction) and about 1,225 service station properties, of which 61 are being actively remediated.\nAshland's reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $163 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $177 million at September 30, 2016, of which $121 million at September 30, 2017 and $134 million at September 30, 2016 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashland's estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, probability techniques, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Ashland's recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $15 million and $23 million, respectively, of which $14 million and $15 million, respectively, were classified in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland's ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $416 million. The largest reserve for any site is approximately 15% of the remediation reserve.\nOUTLOOK\nAshland issued its financial outlook for fiscal 2018 as shown in the table below.\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>FY2018 Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Ingredients\n</td> <td>$560 - $590 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composites\n</td> <td>$85 - $95 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediates & Solvents\n</td> <td>$40 - $50 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated and other\n</td> <td>($35 - $45 million)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key Operating Metrics\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>>$220 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EPS\n</td> <td>$3.20 - $3.40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation & amortization\n</td> <td>~$290 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$125 - $135 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>8 - 13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$195 - $205 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted share count\n</td> <td>~64 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nM-36\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nAshland's financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as a result, do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) lose purchasing power as a result of inflation, while monetary liabilities (such as accounts payable and indebtedness) result in a gain, because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland's monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities, leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation. However, given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the United States in the past decade as well as forward economic outlooks, current inflationary pressures seem moderate.\nCertain of the industries in which Ashland operates are capital-intensive, and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs. However, because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies, such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities, mitigating at least part of the increased expense.\nAshland uses the LIFO method to value a relatively small portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs. However, LIFO values such inventories below their replacement costs during inflationary periods.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements made under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d (MD&A), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Ashland's expectations and assumptions include, without limitation, those mentioned within the MD&A, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures that Ashland has made or may make, including the acquisition of Pharmachem (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashland's substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashland's future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); the potential that Ashland does not realize all of the expected benefits of the separation of its Valvoline business; and severe weather, natural disasters, cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters). Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are contained in Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties\u201d in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Information on Ashland's website is not incorporated into or a part of this Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Ashland assessed and summed the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. The calculated fair value for each reporting unit summed together exceeded Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date by approximately 25%. Ashland evaluated this implied control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions, noting the 25% implied control premium was below levels of other recent comparable transactions. Accordingly, Ashland believed that its calculated fair values for its reporting units was an appropriately conservative estimate of fair value for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment. If the implied control premium was not reasonable in light of this assessment, Ashland would reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and other assumptions as necessary.\nOUTLOOK\nIn May 2015, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to 39 cents per share to eligible shareholders of record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, each quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015. This amount was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of 34 cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2015.\nAshland Separation of Valvoline\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(142\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and other postretirement net periodic income (a)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring activities (includes separation, severance, integration and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>stranded divestiture costs)\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal reserve\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental reserves for divested businesses\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax indemnity income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unallocated expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(146\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 The pension and postretirement obligation adjustment was income of $14 million and a loss of $18 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes.

The scheduled aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the next five fiscal years (including the current portion and excluding debt issuance costs) are as follows: $6 million in 2018, $11 million in 2019, $269 million in 2020, $56 million in 2021 and $1,279 million in 2022.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(net of taxes)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized translation gain (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement obligation adjustment\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nSales by Reportable Segment\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Ingredients\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composites\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediates and Solvents\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest and other financing expense decreased $1 million in 2016 compared to 2015. In connection with financing activities during 2016 and 2015, interest expense included $6 million of accelerated debt issuance costs during 2016 compared to $2 million of accelerated amortization for previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs expensed immediately during 2015. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher debt levels maintained in 2016 compared to 2015. Changes in other financing costs for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily the result of a $9 million charge related to the early redemption premium payment for the tender of certain notes in 2015.

Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate).

Under the terms of the Transfer and Administration Agreement, CVG could, from time to time, obtain up to $350 million (in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of Ashland and its subsidiaries) from the Conduit Investors, the Uncommitted Investors and/or the Committed Investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable, related assets and collections. Subsequently during 2014 and 2015, the available funding for qualifying receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $350 million to $275 million during 2014 and from $275 million to $250 million during 2015 due to the divestitures that occurred during the fiscal years. The accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $250 million to $100 million when Valvoline was removed as an Originator as part of the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities in September 2016. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Transfer and Administration Agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily reinvestments) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Originators and transferred to CVG, with settlement generally occurring monthly. Ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to CVG, the accounts receivable, related assets and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Originator's own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Originator become insolvent. Substantially all of CVG's assets have been pledged to the Agent in support of its obligations under the Transfer and Administration Agreement.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(181\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unplanned plant shutdown\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of non-GAAP measures\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAshland's debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nAs part of the goodwill impairment assessment, Ashland compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its respective estimated fair value. Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those reporting units through the use of a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting unit's industry peer group. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions. Significant assumptions Ashland utilized in these models for the current year included: projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. The base models of future financial performance projections utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment reflect conservative assumptions on future operating performance as approved by Management and the Board of Directors. Ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization, and implied control premium, to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. Subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews.\nExcluding the voluntary pension contribution in 2015, the cash results during each year were primarily driven by net income, excluding discontinued operation results, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization (including debt issuance cost amortization), losses on acquisitions and divestitures as well as changes in working capital, which are fluctuations within accounts receivable, inventory, trade payables and accrued expenses. Ashland continues to emphasize working capital management as a high priority and focus.\nAs a result of the full separation of Valvoline Inc. on May 12, 2017, the operating results related to Valvoline Inc., including the operating results of the former Valvoline reportable segment, have been reflected as discontinued operations (net of tax) within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented. Valvoline's sales included in discontinued operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1,237 million (reflective of sales until the full separation on May 12, 2017), $1,929 million and $1,967 million, respectively. Valvoline's pre-tax income of discontinued operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $240 million, $444 million and $320 million, respectively.\nAshland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable Ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations. These projections are based on various assumptions that include, but are not limited to: operational results, capital expenditures, working capital needs and tax payment and receipts.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations (as reported)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key items\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income totaled $237 million for 2016 compared to $239 million in 2015.

Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's outlooks both remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings may have an effect on Ashland's borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.\nAshland's assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, increase in Ashland's weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or other assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event.

Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), income taxes, liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashland's Board of Directors.\n\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused borrowing capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable securitization facility\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility).

Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As Ashland Global Holdings Inc. is the successor to Ashland Inc., the information set forth refers to Ashland Inc. for the periods prior to September 30, 2016 and to Ashland Global Holdings Inc. on and after September 30, 2016.\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2017 annual assessment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment for Specialty Ingredients or Composites. Based on sensitivity analyses performed, a negative 1% change in the long-term growth factor and the weighted-average cost of capital assumption, which are key assumptions, would not have resulted in the carrying value of these reporting units to exceed their respective calculated fair value. Because the fair value results for these reporting units did not indicate a potential impairment existed, Ashland did not record any goodwill impairment for these reporting units during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified for any of these reporting units.\nIf the comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value indicates that a reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value, it is adjusted to its calculated fair value and the adjustment represents the impairment charge.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(net of taxes)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valvoline\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos-related litigation\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Technologies\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nM-13\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nSignificant cash financing activities during 2015 primarily included the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, the redemption of the 2016 Senior Notes, and the repurchase of common stock. As a result of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and redemption of the 2016 Senior Notes, Ashland received $1,100 million from the issuance of the 2015 term loan facility and repaid $623 million in long-term debt. In addition, Ashland repurchased $397 million of common stock and paid cash dividends of $1.46 per share, for a total of $98 million.\nConsolidated review\nAshland uses the LIFO method to value a relatively small portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs. However, LIFO values such inventories below their replacement costs during inflationary periods.\n (a) Amounts exclude service costs of $9 million, $22 million and $22 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are allocated to Ashland's reportable segments. \n2016 compared to 2015\nSpecialty Ingredients is a global leader in cellulose ethers, vinyl pyrrolidones and biofunctionals.

Significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashland's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashland's estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate (excluding key items)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows provided (used) by operating activities from continuing operations, a major source of Ashland's liquidity, amounted to $255 million in 2017, $372 million in 2016 and $(256) million in 2015. The significant decline in operating cash flow during 2015 related primarily to $610 million of pension contributions, which included a $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution made in June 2015 for plans impacted by a pension settlement program. The $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution was primarily related to Ashland's largest U.S. qualified pension plan which has since been transferred to Valvoline as discussed within Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating income totaled $233 million for 2017 compared to $237 million in 2016. EBITDA decreased $14 million to $462 million in 2017, while Adjusted EBITDA increased $17 million to $493 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2017 to 22.2%.\nAt Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate). The TLA Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Three-Year TLA Facility will not amortize and will be due on May 17, 2020. The Five-Year TLA Facility will not amortize in each of the first, second and third years and will amortize at a rate of 20% per annum in each of the fourth and fifth years (payable in equal quarterly installments), with the outstanding balance of the Five-Year TLA Facility to be paid on May 17, 2022.\nM-11\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\nM-8\n \u2022 as part of a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, 2016 included a net $1 million of restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation, while 2015 included severance and other costs of $17 million and accelerated depreciation of $6 million; and \nChanges in net working capital accounted for an outflow of $27 million in 2017 and inflows of $26 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were driven by the following:\nAmortization expense recognized on finite-lived intangible assets was $82 million for 2017, $76 million for 2016 and $78 million for 2015, and is primarily included in the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nAshland recognized separation costs of $95 million and $88 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are primarily related to transaction, consulting and legal fees. During 2017 and 2016, $13 million and $7 million, respectively, of the separation costs directly related to Valvoline were included within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. Otherwise, separation costs are recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n \u2022 Accounts receivable - Changes in accounts receivable resulted in a $64 million outflow of cash in 2017 compared to cash inflows of $77 million and $211 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash outflow in 2017 was \nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nFinancing Activities\n \u2022 In 2016, other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was a loss of $14 million, compared to a loss of $369 million during 2015. The fluctuations in unrealized translation gains and losses are primarily due to translating foreign subsidiary financial statements from local currencies to U.S. Dollars. The prior year was significantly impacted by fluctuations in the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar. \nA Tax Matters Agreement between Ashland and Valvoline Inc. governs the rights and obligations after the spin-off regarding certain income taxes and other taxes, including certain tax liabilities and benefits, attributes, returns and contests.\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2017 decreased 27% compared to 2016, while expenses as a percent of sales decreased 9.7 percentage points. Key drivers of the fluctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2016 were:\n\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales increased $127 million, or 6%, to $2,216 million in 2017. The acquisition of Pharmachem in the current year increased sales by $104 million, or 5%, while a toller agreement exit and the divestiture of a joint venture combined to decrease sales by $13 million. Volume increased sales by $72 million as metric tons increased to 317.2 thousand in 2017, while mix declined sales by $32 million during the current fiscal year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $10 million, while improved product pricing increased sales by $6 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u2022 a $33 million decrease in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 due to fluctuations in adjustments from the losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans; \nCash provided (used) by financing activities was $154 million for 2017, $(1,845) million for 2016, and $(30) million for 2015. Significant cash financing activities for the current year included cash outflows of $915 million primarily related to the full repayment of the 2018 notes and partial repayments of the 2029 notes and 2022 notes. The current year also included cash inflows of $1,100 million from the issuance of the TLA Facilities and the TLB Facility. See further discussion regarding financing activities within the Key Developments\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis herein. Additionally, the current year included short-term debt net cash inflows of $75 million primarily related to debt outstanding on the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and the accounts receivable securitization, partially offset by the repayment of the term loan due 2017. The current year included cash dividends paid of $1.23 per share, for a total of $77 million.\nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2016 included a $12 million impairment related to a Specialty Ingredients joint venture, as well as a gain on the sale of the Kelowna plant and other post-closing adjustments related to previous divestitures of $2 million each.\n \u2022 Separation, restructuring and other costs, net, include the following: \nM-27\nA comparative analysis of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) is provided below for the last three fiscal years ended September 30.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\n (a) Excludes $19 million, $6 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 $4 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Pharmachem during 2017; \nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nOperating income (loss) amounted income of $142 million in 2017, a loss of $127 million in 2016, and income of $112 million in 2015.

These key items are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline and $4 million of restructuring charges related to office buildings during 2016; \nTangible assets\n\nDuring July 2016, Ashland amended the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement to permit the Reorganization and the series of events relating to the separation of Valvoline Inc. Additionally, the amendment provided that if the aggregate principal amount of the Valvoline debt reaches $750 million, Ashland would be required to use the net proceeds of such borrowings to repay the 2015 term loan facility and/or permanently reduce its existing revolving credit commitments under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. As a result of the July 2016 amendment and the Valvoline debt borrowings in connection with the separation, Ashland reduced its revolving borrowing capacity to $800 million.\n\n \u2022 Discontinued operations, which are reported net of taxes, resulted in income of $133 million, $255 million and $321 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u2022 $9 million, $15 million and $12 million net environmental charges during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; \nM-2\nThe free cash flow metric enables Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - REPORTABLE SEGMENT REVIEW\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, increased $75 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of the following components.\nFree cash flow and other liquidity information\nLong-lived assets\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix, $87 million of tax expense related to deemed dividend inclusions and a $25 million tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of foreign tax credits.\nDiscontinued Operations Assessment\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nAshland's net income (loss) is primarily affected by results within operating income, net interest and other financing expense, net loss on acquisitions and divestitures, income taxes, discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring. Operating income includes Ashland's adjustment for the immediate recognition of the change in the fair value of the plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans each fiscal year.\nCash flows for discontinued operations in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to net cash outflows of $158 million and net cash inflows of $1,629 million, respectively, related to the activity of Valvoline Inc. The remaining cash flows for discontinued operations for these years related to other previously divested businesses, including net payments of asbestos and environmental liabilities.\nThe remaining unallocated items included charges for restructuring activities of $100 million, $125 million and $41 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Restructuring activities primarily included $82 million and $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline during both 2017 and 2016, respectively, along with stranded divestiture costs of $13 million, $37 million, and $35 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these stranded divestiture costs, $22 million and $23 million related to costs previously allocated to the Valvoline reportable segment during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additional, restructuring activities included $4 million of integration charges during 2017 related to the acquisition of Pharmachem.\nAshland's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, are summarized as follows.\nAny change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.5x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 0.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated net leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.\nAshland had $566 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2017, of which $556 million was held by foreign subsidiaries and had no significant limitations that would prohibit remitting the funds to satisfy corporate obligations. However, if this amount was repatriated to the United States, additional taxes would likely need to be accrued and paid depending on the source of the earnings remitted. Ashland currently has no plans to repatriate any amounts for which additional U.S. taxes would need to be accrued.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's investing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n \u2022 Free cash flow - operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.  Management believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAsbestos litigation\nDebt\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem Laboratories, Inc. (Pharmachem), a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016; \n \u2022 Inventory - Changes in inventory resulted in a cash outflow of $23 million in 2017 compared to cash inflows of $48 million and $45 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were primarily due to sales volumes and inventory management. \n \u2022 $1 million of net restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility during 2016; and \nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's operating activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCost of sales for 2017 increased $219 million, or 10%, compared to 2016. The Pharmachem acquisition increased cost of sales by $72 million, or 3%, while the net impact of other acquisitions and divestitures increased cost of sales by $9 million. Changes in volume and product mix and higher production costs increased cost of sales by $67 million, or 3%, and 52 million, or 2%, respectively. Favorable currency exchange decreased cost of sales by $7 million.\n \u2022 $13 million of costs related to unplanned plant shutdowns during 2017 include the following: \nAshland's net income was $28 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $28 million in 2016. Ashland's Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5% during 2017 compared to 2016 to $570 million (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation on page M-7). The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to declines in the Unallocated and other reportable segment, where there was a $63 million decrease in pension and other postretirement income in 2017 resulting from the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016. In addition, the prior year included $22 million of previously allocated corporate costs to Valvoline. Excluding these two items, Adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $13 million, or 2%. Reviewing the operational Adjusted EBITDA performance, both Specialty Ingredients and Composites slightly increased while I&S slightly decreased compared to 2016.\n (a) Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold. \n \u2022 $5 million and $15 million charges for legal reserves during 2017 and 2016, respectively; \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nM-31\nThe 2015 Term Loan Facility balance was repaid in full in connection with the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities during September 2016. In connection with these transactions, Ashland recognized a $6 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2016.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\nSales by each reportable segment expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nNet income (loss)\nAshland issued its financial outlook for fiscal 2018 as shown in the table below.\nThe significant cash investing activities for 2016 included capital expenditures of $231 million and reimbursements of $33 million from the restricted renewable annual trust established as a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement.\n\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2016 annual assessment of impairment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques determined that the carrying value of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit exceeded its fair value at July 1, 2016, which resulted in the reporting unit failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Ashland then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which involved, among other things, obtaining third-party appraisals of substantially all of Intermediates and Solvents' tangible and intangible assets. Based on the results of its goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016, Ashland recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is in addition to a $10 million impairment related to Intermediates and Solvents' property, plant and equipment, and resulted in a total $181 million impairment charge for Intermediates and Solvents during 2016.\nSubsequent to completing the distribution of Valvoline Inc. during the current year, Ashland's operations are now managed within the following three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $3 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $2 million and a reduction in bad debt expense of $2 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $2 million compared to 2016.\nStock repurchase programs\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\n \u2022 $17 million of unrealized gains and $11 million of unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, related to restricted investments, was recognized within other comprehensive income (loss) during 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nDuring 2017, Ashland's Board of Directors extended this $1 billion share repurchase authorization indefinitely. As further described in the stock repurchase program agreements section below, there is $500 million currently remaining on this authorization.\nM-28\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2017 included a net loss of $5 million from the acquisition of Pharmachem, a loss of $4 million recognized for the Specialty Ingredients joint venture divestiture in China and a loss of $1 million due to post-closing adjustments related to other previous divestitures, partially offset by a net gain of $4 million related to a Composites manufacturing facility.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased $61 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Interest expense increased during the current year primarily due to $92 million of accelerated accretion related to the December 2016 tender offer of the 2029 notes, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower debt levels maintained in 2017 compared to 2016. The current year included interest expense of $9 million related to accelerated debt issuance costs associated with 2017 financing activity, which was comprised of $7 million of accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs immediately recognized, while the prior year included interest expense of $6 million related to accelerated debt issuance costs associated with 2016 financing activity. The increase in other financing costs was primarily due to a net $9 million charge for early redemption premium payments during 2017. The available-for-sale securities income of $11 million compared\n\n \u2022 $5 million and $15 million charges for legal reserves during 2017 and 2016, respectively; and \n \u2022 Net loss on acquisitions and divestitures totaled $6 million, $8 million and $89 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nAccounts receivable securitization\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n \u2022 $6 million, $12 million and $92 million of a net loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; \nTotal Equity\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 12 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Ashland reviews property, plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not limited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group, or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property, plant and equipment asset groups, as well as specific appraisals in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property, plant and equipment asset groups. If the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Various factors that Ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups, and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment asset groups, there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods.\nBusiness results\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashland's estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, probability techniques, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Ashland's recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $15 million and $23 million, respectively, of which $14 million and $15 million, respectively, were classified in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for items that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashland's 2017 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.\nA summary of the capital employed in Ashland's current operations, which is calculated by adding equity to capital investment, as of the end of the last three years as follows.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to the termination of a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016.  Selling, general and administrative expense for 2016 increased 32% compared to 2015, while expenses as a percent of sales increased 10.1 percentage points. Key drivers of the fluctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2015 were:\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem, a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nGross profit increased $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Volume increased gross profit by $15 million while the impact of the manufacturing facility acquisition increased gross profit by $2 million. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $10 million and unfavorable product mix decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 2.8 percentage points to 19.8% as compared to 2016.\nM-30\n \u25e6 $82 million and $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline during 2017 and 2016, respectively (which included $2 million of accelerated depreciation during both 2017 and 2016); \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names. These assets had a carrying value of $301 million as of September 30, 2017. Ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Ashland tests these assets using a relief-from-royalty\u201d valuation method compared to the carrying value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include, but are not limited to, such estimates as projected business results, growth rates, weighted-average cost of capital, and royalty rates. The assumptions utilized in the current year models are generally consistent with the prior year models. In conjunction with the July 1 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashland's models did not indicate any impairment, as each indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded their carrying values.\nValvoline met the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation and accordingly, its assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note E within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAshland cash projection\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 25 years, intellectual property over 5 to 25 years and customer and supplier relationships over 3 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis.\nPurchase price allocation\n2016 compared to 2015\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Valvoline reportable segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and continue to be reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were $22 million and $23 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u2022 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) - income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. \nMexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. Ashland has included Pharmachem within the Specialty Ingredients reporting segment.\nGross profit during 2017 increased $18 million compared to 2016. The acquisition of Pharmachem in 2017 increased gross profit by $32 million while improved volume and mix combined to increase gross profit by $21 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to pricing and higher costs of $29 million, which included a $32 million impact from the following key items during 2017 and 2016:\nThe following summary reflects Ashland's cash, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A.\nM-26\nThe following table summarizes the key components of the Unallocated and other segment's operating income (loss) for each of the last three years ended September 30.\nIn October 2012, Ashland and Hercules initiated various arbitration proceedings against Underwriters at Lloyd's, certain London companies and/or Chartis (AIG) member companies seeking to enforce these insurers' contractual obligations to provide indemnity for asbestos liabilities and defense costs under existing coverage-in-place agreements. In addition, Ashland and Hercules initiated a lawsuit in Kentucky state court against certain Berkshire Hathaway entities (National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc.) on grounds that these Berkshire Hathaway entities had wrongfully interfered with Underwriters' and Chartis' performance of their respective contractual obligations to provide asbestos coverage by directing the insurers to reduce and delay certain claim payments.\nSpecialty Ingredients\n\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nElastomers results were included in the Composites reportable segment results of operations within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) until its December 1, 2014 sale. For additional information on the divestiture of the Elastomers division, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $181 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to the non-cash long lived asset impairment recorded during 2016. See further discussion of this impairment within the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements made under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d (MD&A), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Ashland has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d estimates,\u201d is likely,\u201d predicts,\u201d projects,\u201d forecasts,\u201d objectives,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d plans\u201d and intends\u201d and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Ashland may from time to time make forward-looking statements in its Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), news releases and other written and oral communications. These forward-looking statements are based on Ashland's expectations and assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding Ashland's future operating performance and financial condition, as well as the economy and other future events or circumstances. Ashland's expectations and assumptions include, without limitation, those mentioned within the MD&A, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures that Ashland has made or may make, including the acquisition of Pharmachem (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashland's substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashland's future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); the potential that Ashland does not realize all of the expected benefits of the separation of its Valvoline business; and severe weather, natural disasters, cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters). Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are contained in Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties\u201d in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Information on Ashland's website is not incorporated into or a part of this Form 10-K.\n\nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.8, which is below the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement of 4.50. At September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 4.7, which exceeds the minimum required consolidated ratio of 3.0.\nCosts of transaction\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions, Ashland retained Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. (HR&A). The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, enacted legislation, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, HR&A estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased by $16 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $323 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $321 million at September 30, 2016.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\nAs part of its normal course of business, Ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments. These arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. Ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in cost of sales between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and between fiscal years 2016 and 2015.\nAs a result of this settlement, Ashland recorded an after-tax gain of $120 million within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during 2015. The Ashland insurance receivable balance was also reduced as a result of this settlement by $227 million within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u2022 $21 million and $38 million in net environmental-related expenses during 2017 and 2016, respectively; \nto $8 million in the prior year represents investment income related to restricted investments discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe following table reflects the U.S. GAAP calculation for the loss from continuing operations adjusted for the cumulative diluted EPS effect for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table in the previous section. The Adjusted EPS for the loss from continuing operations in the following table has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations since management believes the use of non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.\n \u2022 Operating income (loss) amounted to income of $142 million in 2017, a loss of $127 million in 2016, and income of $112 million in 2015.  For further information on the items reported above, see the discussion in the comparative Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption review analysis.\n\nWater Technologies activity during the current year was related to post-closing adjustments. Water Technologies activity during 2015 related primarily to income of $5 million due to a foreign pension plan remeasurement discussed in Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as other post-closing adjustments.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's financing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment. Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items, which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures, as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA, which may include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.\nThe 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix and net favorable items predominantly due to the release of certain valuation allowances related to state deferred tax assets. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an accrual for an unrecognized tax benefit and tax related to certain global restructuring steps.\nAshland completed the distribution of its remaining 170 million shares of common stock of Valvoline Inc. as a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017. Based on the shares of Ashland common stock outstanding as of May 5, 2017, the record date for the distribution, each share of Ashland common stock received 2.745338 shares of Valvoline common stock in the distribution. The distribution was recorded at the carrying amount of Valvoline Inc.'s net assets which was a deficit of $187 million as of May 12, 2017.\n (a) Excludes the assets and liabilities classified within unallocated and other which primarily includes debt and other long-term liabilities such as asbestos and pension. The net liability in unallocated and other was $3,031 million, $2,479 million and $2,876 million as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nDuring 2015, Ashland announced and completed accelerated share repurchase agreements (2015 ASR Agreements) with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan to repurchase an aggregate of $270 million of Ashland's common stock. Under the 2015 ASR Agreements, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $270 million, split evenly between the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock. The 2015 ASR Agreements had a variable maturity, at the financial institutions option, with a maximum pricing period termination date of July 31, 2015. During 2015, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan exercised their early termination option under the 2015 ASR Agreements and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $125.22 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by the financial institutions under the 2015 ASR Agreements was 2.2 million shares. Ashland received the additional 0.3 million shares from the financial institutions during 2015 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased.\nAshland profile\nThe acquisition was recorded by Ashland using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on respective fair values.\nAshland paid income taxes of $79 million during 2017 compared to $108 million in 2016 and $226 million in 2015. Cash receipts for interest income were $4 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $6 million in 2015, while cash payments for interest expense amounted to $132 million in 2017, $162 million in 2016 and $149 million in 2015.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility). At Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 TLB Facility bear interest at either (x) LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum. The 2017 TLB Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium if the prepayment is made on or prior to December 14, 2017 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement). The 2017 TLB Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00% per annum (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the outstanding balance to be paid on May 17, 2024.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nM-24\nComposites' sales decreased $165 million, or 20%, to $669 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $66 million, or 8%, and the divestiture of the Elastomers division resulted in a loss of sales of $40 million, or 5%. Lower volume decreased sales by $30 million, or 4%, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $20 million, or 2%. Changes in product mix decreased sales by $9 million.\nSenior notes refinancing, 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and 2016 Amendment\nUnallocated and other recorded expense of $146 million, $246 million and $214 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Unallocated and other includes pension and other postretirement net periodic costs and income within continuing operations that have not been allocated to reportable segments. These costs include interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of prior service credit as these items are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level, as opposed to service costs which are allocated to reportable segments. The recurring pension and other postretirement components in Unallocated and other resulted in income of $2 million, $65 million and $44 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unallocated and other also includes gains and losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements which resulted in losses of $6 million, $142 million and $208 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in pension and other postretirement income and remeasurements in the current year is primarily due to the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016.\n \u2022 $7 million of noncash charges related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired from Pharmachem at the date of acquisition during 2017; \nThe all-cash purchase price of Pharmachem was $680 million which included working capital adjustments of approximately $20 million. Ashland incurred $5 million of transaction costs during 2017 related to the acquisition, which was recorded within the net loss on acquisitions and divestitures caption in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThe following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Intermediates and Solvents. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items such as $7 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a fire during 2017 and the $181 million non-cash long lived asset impairment recorded in 2016. There were no unusual or key items that affected comparability for Adjusted EBITDA during 2015.\n \u25e6 $3 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of an office building during 2017; \nFinancing activities\nOperating income totaled $63 million in 2016 compared to $61 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $3 million to $85 million in 2016. EBITDA margin increased 2.1 percentage points to 12.7% in 2016.\n2017 Credit Agreement\n \u25e6 $27 million of restructuring costs (including $6 million of accelerated depreciation and $17 million related to the restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility) during 2015; \nOperating Activities - Summary\nTotal equity and other income decreased $7 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease from nonrecurring tax consulting income recorded during 2015.\nM-20\nAs of September 30, 2017 and 2016, the receivables from insurers amounted to $68 million and $63 million, respectively. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $5 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nAshland debt covenant restrictions\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashland's management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nM-36\nAshland's reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $163 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $177 million at September 30, 2016, of which $121 million at September 30, 2017 and $134 million at September 30, 2016 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGross profit decreased $12 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $12 million, which included the impact of higher facility turn around costs of $9 million and incremental costs of $7 million related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a fire. Higher volumes increased gross profit by $2 million which was offset by unfavorable product mix of $2 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 4.5 percentage points to 6.5%.\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland's ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $416 million. The largest reserve for any site is approximately 15% of the remediation reserve.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nCost of sales for 2016 decreased $379 million, or 15%, compared to 2015 primarily due to lower production costs, changes in volume and product mix, and the net impact of the acquisition and divestiture of certain divisions and product lines. These factors decreased cost of sales by $119 million, or 5%, $76 million, or 3%, and $69 million, or 3%, respectively. Favorable foreign currency exchange decreased cost of sales by $40 million.\nIntermediates and Solvents' sales decreased $62 million, or 19%, to $261 million in 2016. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $45 million, or 14%, while changes in product mix decreased sales by $15 million, or 5%. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $6 million while higher volume levels increased sales by $4 million.\nOperating loss totaled $12 million in 2017 as compared to $181 million in 2016. EBITDA increased $169 million to $19 million in 2017, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5 million to $26 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 2.1 percentage points to 9.8% in 2017.\nPharmachem Acquisition\n \u2022 Trade and other payables - Changes in trade and other payables resulted in a cash inflow of $60 million in 2017 compared to cash outflows of $99 million and $228 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were primarily driven by fluctuations in trade payables and incentive compensation payouts from the prior year paid during the first quarter of each fiscal year. During 2014, there were increased accruals for incentive compensation and severance related to the 2014 global restructuring which resulted in large cash outflows in 2015.  The remaining cash outflow of $15 million in 2017, cash inflow of $17 million in 2016 and cash outflow of $282 million in 2015 were primarily due to income taxes paid or income tax refunds, interest paid, and adjustments to certain accruals and long term assets and liabilities.\nM-1\n \u2022 $7 million of noncash charges related to the fair value assessment of inventory acquired from Pharmachem at the date of acquisition during 2017; \nIn November 2015, under the 2015 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2016 ASR Agreement) with Goldman Sachs & Co. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $500 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock during November 2015. In February 2016, Goldman Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 2016 ASR Agreement and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $99.01 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by Goldman Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASR Agreement was 5.1 million shares. Ashland received the additional 1.2 million shares during 2016 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased. After the 2016 ASR Agreement, $500 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the 2015 stock repurchase authorization.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions, for example, the life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the expected return on pension plan assets yet excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses, provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance (see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table on page M-7 for additional details on exact amounts included within this non-GAAP measure related to pension and other postretirement plans.) Management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (and in particular interest rates) that are not directly related to the underlying business. For further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures were $199 million for 2017 and averaged $217 million during the last three years. A summary of capital expenditures by reportable segment during 2017, 2016 and 2015 follow.\nDuring 2015, Ashland's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization (the 2015 stock repurchase program) that was set to expire on December 31, 2017. This authorization allows for common shares to be repurchased in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or Rule 10b5-1 plans.\n\nCapital resources\nHercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules' former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nGross profit decreased $9 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume and product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $11 million while pricing effects were more than offset by lower costs, increasing gross profit by $10 million. The sale of Elastomers and unfavorable foreign currency exchange each decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 3.4 percentage points as compared to 2015 to 22.6%.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $36 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $419 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $415 million at September 30, 2016.\n \u2022 EBITDA - net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization. \nThe significant cash investing activities for 2015 included capital expenditures of $220 million and proceeds of $139 million from divestitures which primarily included $105 million from the sale of the Elastomers division and approximately $30 million from the sale of industrial biocides assets. Funds restricted for specific transactions represent the receipt of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement funds of $335 million into a restricted renewable annual trust, partially offset by the reclassification into cash and cash equivalents of $15 million of assets previously restricted in use for property transactions. Additionally, the purchase of and proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $315 million related to investment activity involving equity and corporate bond funds within the asbestos trust.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED REVIEW\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\n \u2022 $16 million of tax indemnity income and a $7 million charge for a stock incentive plan award modification during 2015.  Operating income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included depreciation and amortization of $301 million, $302 million and $306 million, respectively (which includes accelerated depreciation of $19 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, for each year).\nComposites\nAshland's sales generated outside of North America were 60% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Sales by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nCash provided by discontinued operations\nInvesting activities\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA, which can include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales. \n2017 compared to 2016\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2017 Credit Agreement during is 3.0. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period.\n\n \u2022 2016 included $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment while 2015 included a $13 million charge related to a customer claim.  Additionally, gross profit within the energy market decreased $17 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of lower volumes. The remaining gross profit decline of $47 million compared to 2015 was partially due to planned plant turnarounds, which reduced gross profit by $19 million during 2016, while lower costs, primarily raw materials, was offset by pricing declines. Volume and changes in product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $13 million while unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross profit by $11 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets decreased gross profit by $4 million during 2016. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 1.5 percentage points to 33.9% as compared to 2015.\n \u2022 In 2017, the unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency translation adjustments was income of $81 million, compared to a loss of $14 million during 2016. The fluctuations in unrealized translation gains and losses are primarily due to translating foreign subsidiary financial statements from local currencies to U.S. Dollars. \n (a) Fiscal 2015 includes $40 million of sales from the divested Elastomers division for the period October 1, 2014 through the completion of the sale on December 1, 2014. See Note D within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (a) Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation.  Reportable segments\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the change in sales between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and between fiscal years 2016 and 2015.\n \u2022 Ashland incurred pretax net interest and other financing expense of $234 million, $173 million and $174 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was impacted by certain charges associated with debt financing activity during each year. \n \u25e6 $7 million of restructuring costs (including $4 million of accelerated depreciation, a $5 million income adjustment to the previously recorded accrual for a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, $4 million of charges related to the exit from a toller agreement and restructuring of a manufacturing facility, and $4 million of charges related to the restructuring of office buildings) during 2016; and \n \u2022 $6 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a hurricane during 2017; \n\nOn September 22, 2015, Ashland announced that the Board of Directors approved proceeding with a plan to separate Ashland into two independent, publicly traded companies comprising of the new Ashland (now known as Ashland Global Holdings Inc.) and Valvoline Inc. The initial step of the separation, the initial public offering (IPO) of Valvoline Inc., closed on September 28, 2016. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriters' discount and other offering expenses received from the IPO were $712 million, which were used primarily to repay debt incurred prior to the IPO and retained for Valvoline Inc.'s cash on hand. As discussed further within the Final Separation section, Ashland completed the distribution of its remaining shares in Valvoline Inc. on May 12, 2017. The new Ashland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets. Key markets and applications include pharmaceutical, personal care, food and beverage, architectural coatings, adhesives, automotive, construction and energy.\n\nOperating income totaled $67 million in 2017 compared to $63 million in 2016. EBITDA increased $4 million to $89 million in 2017, while the EBITDA margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 11.4% in 2017.\n \u2022 $17 million of restructuring charges related the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility during 2017 (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation); \nPension and other postretirement net periodic costs (income) reduced cost of sales by $13 million compared to 2016, while charges for unplanned plant shutdowns increased cost of sales by $13 million. Other key items combined to increase cost of sales by $26 million compared to 2016.\nAt September 30, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to CVG was $155 million and $133 million, respectively. There were $56 million of borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2017, while Ashland had no borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2016. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 2.8% for 2017 and 1.5% for 2016.\nAfter completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares on May 12, 2017, Ashland owned 170 million shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock which represented approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock. As a result, Ashland continued to consolidate Valvoline within the Consolidated Financial Statements up until the distribution of the remaining shares. The resulting outside stockholders' interests in Valvoline Inc., which was approximately 17% as of September 30, 2016, was presented separately as a noncontrolling interest within Ashland's equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributed to these previous minority holders was presented as a separate caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's discontinued operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashland's most recent credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) is 4.50. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2017 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, noncash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page M-7. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker's acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees.\nSignificant cash financing activities during 2016 included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,095 million primarily related to the 2015 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, 2016 included a cash outflow of $500 million for the repurchase of common stock and short-term net debt repayments of $156 million primarily related to the debt repayments under Ashland's 2015 revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility, and the issuance of the $150 million term loan facility due 2017. Ashland also paid cash dividends of $1.56 per share, for a total of $97 million.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\nAccounts receivable securitization\nM-4\nOperating Activities - Operating Assets and Liabilities\nComposites' sales increased $110 million to $779 million in 2017. Volume increased sales by $59 million, or 9%, as metric tons increased to 346.4 thousand in 2017. Improved product pricing increased sales by $35 million, or 5%, while the acquisition of an unsaturated polyester resins manufacturing facility in the current year increased sales by $22 million, or 3%. Unfavorable product mix decreased sales by $6 million.\n2017 compared to 2016\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nOperating cash flows for 2015 included a loss from continuing operations of $12 million, $208 million of net losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements and noncash adjustments of $306 million for depreciation and amortization, and $18 million for debt issuance cost amortization, as well as the previously discussed $610 million of pension contributions.\nM-18\nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n\n \u2022 an increase of $181 million due to the impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nIncome taxes\nM-22\nThe following discussion outlines significant transactions announced or executed during 2017.\nNew Reportable Segments\nM-29\nUnallocated and other\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nDuring 2017, the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on Ashland's current and future cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nDuring June of 2015, Ashland completed certain refinancing transactions related to the $600 million 3.000% senior notes due in 2016 (2016 Senior Notes). Ashland commenced and completed a cash tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 2016 Senior Notes. At the close of the tender offer, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes was tendered by note holders, representing approximately 92% of the outstanding 2016 Senior Notes, which have been purchased by Ashland. Subsequently, Ashland redeemed the remaining balance of the 2016 Senior Notes of $50 million on July 23, 2015.\nDuring 2015, Ashland used the proceeds from borrowings under the $1.1 billion term loan facility along with cash on hand (i) to fund the tender offer of the 2016 Senior Notes, (ii) to prepay in full the outstanding loans under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, (iii) to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the 2016 Senior Notes, (iv) to contribute funds to the U.S. pension plans impacted by the pension plan settlement program, and (v) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the entry into the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement. As a result of the tender offer and redemption, Ashland recognized a $9 million charge related to early redemption premium payments, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2015.\n \u25e6 $6 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a Specialty Ingredients manufacturing plant due to a hurricane; \nIn connection with the tender offer and redemption, in June 2015, Ashland entered into a new Credit Agreement (the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement replaced the $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 Senior Credit Facility), and was comprised of a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility), which included a $250 million letter of credit sublimit and a $100 million swing line loan sublimit, and a five-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the 2015 term loan facility). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement was not guaranteed, was unsecured and could be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.\n2016 compared to 2015\nM-6\n (a) Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold. \nHercules asbestos-related litigation\nOperating income (loss)\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\n \u2022 a decrease of $181 million due to the impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \n (c) Includes leases for office buildings, retail outlets, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. For further information, see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nKey factors that affected Ashland's conclusion that an impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 included the continued deterioration in the butanediol commodity market during 2016. Market conditions for butanediol, a commodity chemical used in the production of polymers, solvents and fine chemicals, can vary significantly from year to year or even quarter to quarter. Throughout 2016, increasing levels of overcapacity for butanediol in the market, particularly in China, and the resulting weak pricing had a cumulating negative impact on the financial performance of the Intermediates and Solvents division. Butanediol commodity contract prices had fallen consistently during 2016. These factors contributed significantly to lower expected EBITDA results within the longer-term forecast period. Ashland prepares its annual forecast mid-August through October each year. As the 2016 forecast was developed, Ashland considered many factors when assessing the outlook for 2017 and beyond. Because of these factors, Ashland revised its forecasts down significantly, which ultimately led to the goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge for the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe following table aggregates Ashland's obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at September 30, 2017. Contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable have been excluded.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for noncontrolling interests, discontinued operations, net gain (loss) on acquisitions and divestitures, other income and (expense) and key items (including the remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans). \nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nallocation of goodwill are its three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. The reporting units changed from prior years due to Ashland completing the distribution of Valvoline during the current year.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAshland's financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as a result, do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) lose purchasing power as a result of inflation, while monetary liabilities (such as accounts payable and indebtedness) result in a gain, because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland's monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities, leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation. However, given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the United States in the past decade as well as forward economic outlooks, current inflationary pressures seem moderate.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Specialty Ingredients. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items. The key items within the current year related to $17 million restructuring charges for the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation and $3 million of severance and other restructuring costs), $7 million for the revaluation of Pharmachem inventory, $6 million of charges related to an unplanned plant shutdown and $1 million of severance costs. The prior year included $4 million of restructuring charges, partially offset by a $5 million income adjustment to a severance accrual, while 2015 included $17 million of severance and other costs related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan during 2015. The $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan. The $13 million adjustment during 2015 related to a customer claim which was subsequently adjusted by $5 million during 2016. There were environmental reserve adjustments of $2 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impairment of $11 million during 2015 relates to certain in-process research and development assets associated with a previous acquisition.\nOther Financing Activities\nResearch and development expense during 2017 remained relatively consistent with the expense in 2016.\nThe following EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Composites. There were no unusual or key items that affected comparability for EBITDA during the current and prior years.\nThe following details certain changes in key operating assets and liabilities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOn May 17, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Pharmachem acquisition, Ashland entered into a secured credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. On May 19, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility from $680 million to $800 million.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\nExcluding the $181 million impairment charge recorded during 2016 that was previously discussed in the 2017 compared to 2016\u201d narrative, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2 million primarily due to employee related costs.\nLiquidity\nOperating cash flows for 2017 included a loss from continuing operations of $105 million, $6 million of net losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements and noncash adjustments of $301 million for depreciation and amortization, and $109 million for original issue discount and debt issuance cost amortization, including $92 million of accelerated accretion related to the tender offer of the 2029 notes.\nDuring May 2017, subsequent to the final distribution of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock, the Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 22.5 cents per share to eligible shareholders at record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 and represents a reduction from the previous quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share.\nM-16\n\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets Ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative income or loss. In addition, Ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\n\n\n (a) Includes raw material and service contracts where minimal committed quantities and prices are fixed. \nM-14\nM-23\nThe following table shows sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization and statistical operating information by reportable segment for each of the last three years ended September 30.\nAshland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets, including adhesives, architectural coatings, automotive, construction, energy, food and beverage, personal care and pharmaceutical. With approximately 6,500 employees worldwide, Ashland serves customers in more than 100 countries.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nprovide Ashland's investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by Ashland's management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashland's historical operating performance and its business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nDuring the December 2015 quarter, the Transfer and Administration Agreement was amended to extend the termination date of the accounts receivable securitization facility from December 31, 2015 to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement. No other changes to the agreement within the current or prior year amendments are expected to have a significant impact to Ashland's results of operations and financial position.\nResults of Ashland's reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashland's reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded to Unallocated and other. Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashland's methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis.\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nSales for 2016 decreased $401 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Pricing declines and lower volumes decreased sales by $157 million, or 5% percent, and $88 million, or 3%, respectively. Divestitures of certain divisions and product lines decreased sales by $78 million, or 2%, unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $54 million, and product mix decreased sales by $24 million.\n (f) Ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business. For further information, see Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (b) Includes $8 million, $(42) million and $(22) million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of net periodic pension and other postretirement costs (income) recognized ratably through the fiscal year. These costs (income) are comprised of service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credit and are disclosed in further detail in Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAshland entered into settlement agreements totaling $5 million and $4 million with certain insurers during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in a reduction of the Ashland insurance receivable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the same amount.\nThe following represents Ashland's calculation of free cash flow for the disclosed periods and reconciles free cash flow to cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Free cash flow does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. See Results of Operations - Consolidated Review - Use of non-GAAP measures\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 $17 million of incremental costs related to Pharmachem's operations and $4 million of Pharmachem integration costs during 2017; \nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, mortality rates, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 to 50 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $660 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $419 million) and approximately $510 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $323 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nComposites is a global leader in unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl ester resins and gelcoats. The Composites business manufactures and sells a broad range of general-purpose and high-performance grades of unsaturated polyester and vinyl ester resins, gelcoats and low-profile additives for the reinforced plastics industry. The products in the Composites business provide an array of functional properties including corrosion resistance, fire retardance, ultraviolet resistance, water and chemical resistance, high mechanical strength, impact and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios. Key end markets include transportation, construction, marine and infrastructure. In addition, the business manufactures and sells molten maleic anhydride for the manufacture of a variety of products such as unsaturated polyester resins, copolymers, lubricating oil additives, alkenyl succinic anhydrides, malic acid, fumaric acid and numerous derivative chemicals. Key markets include composites, personal care, dispersants and paper sizing.\nAs a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement previously described, Hercules resolved all disputes with Chartis (AIG) member companies under their existing coverage-in-place agreement for past, present and future Hercules asbestos claims. As a result, during 2015, a $22 million reduction in the insurance receivable balance within the Consolidated Balance Sheets was recorded.\nPension and other postretirement plans expense decreased cost of sales by $40 million, primarily as a result of decreased remeasurement losses in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to fluctuations in discount rates. Key items primarily related to severance and other costs and customer claim adjustments resulted in a $35 million decrease to cost of sales in 2016 compared to 2015.\nM-34\n \u2022 $11 million impairment charge related to certain in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets associated with the acquisition of International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP) in 2011 during 2015; and \nAshland reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The annual assessment is performed as of July 1 and consists of Ashland determining each reporting unit's current fair value compared to its current carrying value. Ashland determined that its reporting units for the\nStockholder dividends\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $12 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $6 million, the sale of the Elastomers division of $3 million and favorable foreign currency exchange of $3 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $1 million during 2016 compared to 2015.\n (d) Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of September 30, 2017. \nSales by region expressed as a percentage of reportable segment sales for each of the last three fiscal years ended September 30 were as follows. Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation.\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\n2017 Credit Agreement\nIntermediates and Solvents' sales increased $4 million to $265 million in 2017. The net impact of volume and product pricing increased sales by $7 million with metric tons sold increasing to 137.0 thousand. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower product pricing, which decreased sales by $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\nContractual obligations and other commitments\n (e) Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, Ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. Therefore, these amounts were included in the More than 5 years\u201d column. \n (b) Sales are defined as sales and operating revenues. Gross profit is defined as sales, less cost of sales. \nSince Ashland's ownership interest in Valvoline Inc. was approximately 83% after completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares of Valvoline on May 12, 2017, the amount of net income attributable to the outside stockholders' approximately 17% noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc. was presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP within this caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2017 and 2016.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \u2022 $181 million impairment related to the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \nM-17\nAshland's reporting structure is composed of three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. For further descriptions of each reportable segment, see Results of Operations - Reportable Segment Review\u201d beginning on page M-13.\n\nOn August 31, 2012, Ashland entered into a $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to (i) a Sale Agreement, among Ashland and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an Originator and collectively, the Originators) and CVG Capital III LLC, a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote\u201d special purpose subsidiary of the Originators (CVG) and (ii) a Transfer and Administration Agreement, among CVG, each Originator, Ashland, as Master Servicer, certain Conduit Investors, Uncommitted Investors, Letter of Credit Issuers, Managing Agents, Administrators and Committed Investors, and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as agent for various secured parties (the Agent). The Transfer and Administration Agreement had a term of three years, but was extendable at the discretion of Ashland and the Investors. During 2016, the termination date of the commitments under the Transfer and Administration Agreement was extended from December 31, 2015, the previous termination extension date, to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement.\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on Ashland, see Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSubsequent to completing the distribution of Valvoline Inc. during the current year, Ashland's operations are now managed within the following three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\n \u2022 $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment during 2016.  Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and the divestiture of a joint ventures decreased gross profit by $4 million and $2 million, respectively. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 1.2 percentage points to 32.7% as compared to 2016.\n \u25e6 $17 million of restructuring charges related the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility during 2017 (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation); \nCertain of the industries in which Ashland operates are capital-intensive, and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs. However, because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies, such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities, mitigating at least part of the increased expense.\nM-3\n\n\n\nGross profit during 2016 decreased $26 million compared to 2015. Gross profit included certain key items during 2016 and 2015 as follows:\n \u25e6 $7 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of an Intermediates and Solvents manufacturing plant due to a fire; and \n\nprimarily the result of increased accounts receivable due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015.\n (b) Includes estimated funding of Ashland's qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans for 2018 as well as projected benefit payments through 2027 under Ashland's unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Excludes the benefit payments from the pension plan trust funds. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nTotal equity increased $241 million since September 30, 2016 to $3,406 million at September 30, 2017. The increase of $241 million was primarily due to $187 million related to the distribution of Valvoline Inc., $27 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc., $81 million related to deferred translation gains, $15 million for common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans and $15 million of a net change in the gain on available-for-sale securities. These increases were partially offset by $77 million of regular cash dividends.\nStock repurchase program agreements\n (a) Excludes $14 million, $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2015 primarily included the pre-tax loss on sale related to Elastomers of $86 million, as well as a net $3 million loss due to other post-closing adjustments related to previous divestitures.\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility was $579 million due to an outstanding balance of $173 million, as well as a reduction of $48 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2017. In total, Ashland's available liquidity position, which includes cash, the revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility, was $1,180 million at September 30, 2017 as compared to $1,839 million at September 30, 2016 and $2,280 million at September 30, 2015. For further information, see Note I within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAshland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:\nM-33\nM-35\n \u2022 Ashland's net income attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to $27 million and $1 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and reflects the noncontrolling interest of Valvoline Inc. for the period after the IPO close on September 28, 2016 and before the final distribution occurred on May 12, 2017. \nOperating income (loss) totaled a loss of $181 million in 2016 as compared to income of $26 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $208 million to a loss of $150 million in 2016, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $27 million to $31 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 6.1 percentage points to 11.9% in 2016.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to the termination of a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016; and \nEBITDA reconciliation\nAt Ashland's option, borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The loans' interest rate fluctuated between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.50% per annum), based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility through and including June 30, 2015, and thereafter the fee rate fluctuated between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee rate).\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales decreased $174 million, or 8%, to $2,089 million in 2016. Energy market sales decreased $55 million compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volume as a result of reduced demand by customers, specifically those within industries negatively impacted by a low oil price environment. In addition, pricing declines reduced sales by $45 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets and the exit from the redispersible powders product line decreased sales by $24 million and $11 million, respectively. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and changes in volume and product mix combined decreased sales by $27 million and $12 million, respectively.\n \u2022 a $98 million decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 due to fluctuations in adjustments from the losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans; \nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $155 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims). Receivables from insurers amounted to $151 million at September 30, 2016. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $15 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\n \u2022 $13 million charge related to a customer claim during 2015 and a subsequent $5 million income adjustment to the customer claim during 2016; \nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nM-12\nGoodwill\nIntermediates and Solvents is a leading producer of 1,4 butanediol (BDO) and related derivatives, including tetrahydrofuran and n-methylpyrrolidone. These products are used as chemical intermediates in the production of engineering polymers and polyurethanes, and as specialty process solvents in a wide array of applications including electronics, pharmaceuticals, water filtration membranes and more. Butanediol is also supplied to Ashland's Specialty Ingredients business for use as a raw material.\nAdditional capital resources\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) - caption review\n \u2022 The pension and postretirement obligation adjustment was a loss of $4 million during 2017 compared to income of $14 million during 2016. Of these amounts, $4 million and $41 million during the current and prior years, respectively, of unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans were amortized and reclassified into net income. Additional unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, of $55 million during 2016 were included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements. \n\nAsbestos-related activity during the current and prior years included the after-tax net adjustments to the asbestos reserves and receivables of $25 million and $30 million, respectively. The net gain of $110 million during 2015 included an after-tax gain of $120 million related to the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement, partially offset by after-tax net expense adjustments to the asbestos reserves and receivables, including the adjustments for changes in estimates as well as a deferred tax adjustment.\n \u2022 $6 million, $142 million and $208 million related to pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement losses during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the immediate recognition from the change in fair value of the plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans; \n (c) Excludes income of $4 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to ongoing adjustments of previous divestiture transactions. ", "item_7_text": "Ashland assessed and summed the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. The calculated fair value for each reporting unit summed together exceeded Ashland's market capitalization at the annual assessment date by approximately 25%. Ashland evaluated this implied control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions, noting the 25% implied control premium was below levels of other recent comparable transactions. Accordingly, Ashland believed that its calculated fair values for its reporting units was an appropriately conservative estimate of fair value for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment. If the implied control premium was not reasonable in light of this assessment, Ashland would reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and other assumptions as necessary.\nOUTLOOK\nIn May 2015, the Board of Directors of Ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to 39 cents per share to eligible shareholders of record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, each quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015. This amount was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of 34 cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2015.\nAshland Separation of Valvoline\n \u2022 The pension and postretirement obligation adjustment was income of $14 million and a loss of $18 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $41 million and $17 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, of unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans were amortized and reclassified into net income. Additional unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, of $55 million during 2016 and prior service cost, net of tax, of $1 million during 2015 were included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements. \n\nCash used by investing activities was $829 million in 2017 compared to $177 million and $391 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant cash investing activities for the current year primarily related to cash outflows of $680 million for the acquisition of Pharmachem and $199 million for capital expenditures. The current year also included reimbursements of $27 million from the restricted renewable annual trust established as a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement.\nGoodwill associated with the reporting units as of September 30, 2017 was $2,315 million for Specialty Ingredients, $150 million for Composites, and zero for Intermediates and Solvents as a result of full impairment during 2016.\nOperating activities\n \u2022 Ashland's net income (loss) attributable to Ashland amounted to income of $1 million in 2017, a loss of $29 million in 2016, and income of $309 million in 2015, or $0.01, $(0.47) and $4.54 diluted earnings (loss) per share, respectively. \nAdditionally, Unallocated and other included environmental charges related to previously divested businesses of $20 million, $36 million and $29 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and charges for legal reserves of $5 million and $15 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix and net unfavorable adjustments primarily related to a nondeductible goodwill impairment for the Intermediates and Solvents division, valuation allowances for domestic attributes, accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and items related to the separation of Valvoline.\nM-10\nAshland completed the transfer of its ownership interest in a consolidated joint venture during 2017 and sold the industrial biocides assets during 2015. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures.\nM-21\nM-25\n\nM-7\nTotal depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $219 million, $226 million and $228 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included $19 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, in accelerated depreciation. Capitalized interest for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $1 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively.\nOn May 17, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Pharmachem acquisition, Ashland entered into a secured credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. On May 19, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility from $680 million to $800 million.\nM-19\nAt September 30, 2017, working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations and long-term debt due within one year) amounted to $941 million, compared to $1,315 million at the end of 2016. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) amounted to 122% of current liabilities (excluding current liabilities of discontinued operations) at September 30, 2017 and 180% at September 30, 2016.\nTotal equity and other income remained relatively consistent with the prior year.\nA comparative analysis of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) by caption is provided as follows for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIntermediates and Solvents\nEBITDA totaled $551 million, $416 million and $644 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results in the following table have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items, including the net loss on certain acquisitions and divestitures during 2017, 2016 and 2015, since management believes the use of such non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.\nCapital expenditures\nBackground\n \u2022 Loss from continuing operations, which excludes results from discontinued operations, amounted to $105 million in 2017, $283 million in 2016 and $12 million in 2015. \n \u2022 tax indemnification income of $16 million and a stock incentive award modification resulting in expense of $7 million during 2015. \nM-9\nAshland credit ratings\n (a) Includes $25 million and $20 million of debt issuance cost discounts as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The current portion of long-term debt was $6 million at September 30, 2017. Debt as a percent of capital employed was 45% at September 30, 2017 and 44% at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2017, Ashland's total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $2,897 million, discounts of $53 million, and debt issuance costs of $25 million. The scheduled aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the next five fiscal years (including the current portion and excluding debt issuance costs) are as follows: $6 million in 2018, $11 million in 2019, $269 million in 2020, $56 million in 2021 and $1,279 million in 2022.\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\nNet interest and other financing expense decreased $1 million in 2016 compared to 2015. In connection with financing activities during 2016 and 2015, interest expense included $6 million of accelerated debt issuance costs during 2016 compared to $2 million of accelerated amortization for previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs expensed immediately during 2015. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher debt levels maintained in 2016 compared to 2015. Changes in other financing costs for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily the result of a $9 million charge related to the early redemption premium payment for the tender of certain notes in 2015. The available-for-sale securities income of $8 million in 2016 compared to $3 million in 2015 represents investment income related to restricted investments discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFluctuations in cost of sales are driven primarily by raw material prices, volume and changes in product mix, currency exchange, losses or gains on pension and other postretirement benefit plan remeasurements, and other certain charges incurred as a result of changes or events within the businesses or restructuring activities.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (which includes research and development expenses throughout the reportable segment discussion and analysis) increased $20 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to incremental costs of $17 million related to Pharmachem's operations. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $2 million compared to 2016.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nKey financial results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included the following:\n\nAt Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate). The TLA Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Three-Year TLA Facility will not amortize and will be due on May 17, 2020. The Five-Year TLA Facility will not amortize in each of the first, second and third years and will amortize at a rate of 20% per annum in each of the fourth and fifth years (payable in equal quarterly installments), with the outstanding balance of the Five-Year TLA Facility to be paid on May 17, 2022.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $24 million, or 5%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an $11 million impairment of IPR&D assets within research and development expenses during 2015 and favorable foreign currency exchange of $8 million. Inflationary increases were offset by other savings initiatives. Equity and other income (loss) remained consistent compared to 2015.\nUnder the Sale Agreement, each Originator will transfer, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable, certain related assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to CVG. Under the terms of the Transfer and Administration Agreement, CVG could, from time to time, obtain up to $350 million (in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of Ashland and its subsidiaries) from the Conduit Investors, the Uncommitted Investors and/or the Committed Investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable, related assets and collections. Subsequently during 2014 and 2015, the available funding for qualifying receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $350 million to $275 million during 2014 and from $275 million to $250 million during 2015 due to the divestitures that occurred during the fiscal years. The accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $250 million to $100 million when Valvoline was removed as an Originator as part of the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities in September 2016. Ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Transfer and Administration Agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily reinvestments) as new accounts receivable are originated by the Originators and transferred to CVG, with settlement generally occurring monthly. Ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to CVG, the accounts receivable, related assets and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Originator's own assets and are not available to its creditors should such Originator become insolvent. Substantially all of CVG's assets have been pledged to the Agent in support of its obligations under the Transfer and Administration Agreement.\nUse of non-GAAP measures\n\n\nAshland's debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.\nAs part of the goodwill impairment assessment, Ashland compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its respective estimated fair value. Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those reporting units through the use of a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting unit's industry peer group. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions. Significant assumptions Ashland utilized in these models for the current year included: projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. The base models of future financial performance projections utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment reflect conservative assumptions on future operating performance as approved by Management and the Board of Directors. Ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland's market capitalization, and implied control premium, to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. Subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews.\nExcluding the voluntary pension contribution in 2015, the cash results during each year were primarily driven by net income, excluding discontinued operation results, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization (including debt issuance cost amortization), losses on acquisitions and divestitures as well as changes in working capital, which are fluctuations within accounts receivable, inventory, trade payables and accrued expenses. Ashland continues to emphasize working capital management as a high priority and focus.\nAs a result of the full separation of Valvoline Inc. on May 12, 2017, the operating results related to Valvoline Inc., including the operating results of the former Valvoline reportable segment, have been reflected as discontinued operations (net of tax) within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented. Valvoline's sales included in discontinued operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1,237 million (reflective of sales until the full separation on May 12, 2017), $1,929 million and $1,967 million, respectively. Valvoline's pre-tax income of discontinued operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $240 million, $444 million and $320 million, respectively.\nAshland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable Ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations. These projections are based on various assumptions that include, but are not limited to: operational results, capital expenditures, working capital needs and tax payment and receipts.\nOperating income totaled $237 million for 2016 compared to $239 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $1 million to $476 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $51 million to $476 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2016 to 22.8%.\nAshland's corporate credit rating with Standard & Poor's is BB, while Moody's Investor Services is Ba2. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's outlooks both remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings may have an effect on Ashland's borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.\nAshland's assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives, including goodwill, could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, increase in Ashland's weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or other assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event. For further information, see Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinal Separation\nM-32\nThe preparation of Ashland's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), income taxes, liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashland's Board of Directors.\n\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility). At Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 TLB Facility bear interest at either (x) LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum. The 2017 TLB Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium if the prepayment is made on or prior to December 14, 2017 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement). The 2017 TLB Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00% per annum (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the outstanding balance to be paid on May 17, 2024.\n \u2022 an increase of $38 million due to higher pension and other postretirement income in 2016 primarily due to the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016; \nM-15\nCash provided by discontinued operations during 2015 included $319 million of net cash inflows related to the activity of Valvoline Inc., $398 million of cash received, before taxes, related to the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement, and $48 million of delayed cash proceeds for a foreign entity from the sale of Water Technologies. These inflows were partially offset by $91 million in tax payments primarily from the Water Technologies sale and a $20 million payment for the working capital settlement related to the disposition of Water Technologies. The remaining cash flows in 2015 principally related to other previously divested businesses, including net payments of asbestos and environmental liabilities.\n \u2022 Gains of $15 million and $17 million on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, related to restricted investments, were recognized within other comprehensive income (loss) during 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, increased $415 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the following components.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\nResearch and development expense for 2016 decreased $12 million as compared to 2015 primarily due to an impairment of $11 million related to certain IPR&D assets associated with a previous acquisition during 2015.\nIn addition, during 2015, Ashland placed $335 million of the settlement funds received into a renewable annual trust restricted for the purpose of paying for ongoing and future litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in conjunction with asbestos claims.\nAshland incurred $10 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2015 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance was amortized over the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the repayment of the 2016 Senior Notes, Ashland recognized a $2 million charge during 2015 for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nSales for 2017 increased $241 million, or 8%, compared to 2016. The acquisition of Pharmachem within the Specialty Ingredients reportable segment increased sales by $104 million, or 3%, while the net impact of other acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by $9 million. Improved volume increased sales by $139 million, or 5%, while higher pricing increased sales by $40 million. Product mix decreased sales by $39 million and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $12 million.\n \u2022 The effective income tax expense rate of 7% for 2017, income tax benefit rate of 8% for 2016, and income tax benefit rate of 92% for 2015, were significantly impacted by a number of discrete items. \nThe following summary reflects Ashland's debt as of September 30, 2017 and 2016.\nM-5\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As Ashland Global Holdings Inc. is the successor to Ashland Inc., the information set forth refers to Ashland Inc. for the periods prior to September 30, 2016 and to Ashland Global Holdings Inc. on and after September 30, 2016.\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2017 annual assessment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment for Specialty Ingredients or Composites. Based on sensitivity analyses performed, a negative 1% change in the long-term growth factor and the weighted-average cost of capital assumption, which are key assumptions, would not have resulted in the carrying value of these reporting units to exceed their respective calculated fair value. Because the fair value results for these reporting units did not indicate a potential impairment existed, Ashland did not record any goodwill impairment for these reporting units during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified for any of these reporting units.\nIf the comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value indicates that a reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value, it is adjusted to its calculated fair value and the adjustment represents the impairment charge.\nM-13\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nSignificant cash financing activities during 2015 primarily included the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, the redemption of the 2016 Senior Notes, and the repurchase of common stock. As a result of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and redemption of the 2016 Senior Notes, Ashland received $1,100 million from the issuance of the 2015 term loan facility and repaid $623 million in long-term debt. In addition, Ashland repurchased $397 million of common stock and paid cash dividends of $1.46 per share, for a total of $98 million.\nConsolidated review\nAshland uses the LIFO method to value a relatively small portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs. However, LIFO values such inventories below their replacement costs during inflationary periods.\n (a) Amounts exclude service costs of $9 million, $22 million and $22 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are allocated to Ashland's reportable segments. \n2016 compared to 2015\nSpecialty Ingredients is a global leader in cellulose ethers, vinyl pyrrolidones and biofunctionals. It offers industry-leading products, technologies and resources for solving formulation and product-performance challenges. Specialty Ingredients uses natural, synthetic and semisynthetic polymers derived from cellulose ethers, vinyl pyrrolidones, acrylic polymers, polyester and polyurethane-based adhesives, and plant and seed extract. Specialty Ingredient' end markets offer comprehensive and innovative solutions for today's demanding consumer and industrial applications. Key customers include: pharmaceutical companies; makers of personal care products, food and beverages; makers of nutraceuticals and supplements; manufacturers of paint, coatings and construction materials; packaging and converting; and oilfield service companies.\nOn January 13, 2015, Ashland and Hercules entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement related to certain insurance coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims with Underwriters at Lloyd's, certain London companies and Chartis (AIG) member companies, along with National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc., under which Ashland and Hercules received a total of $398 million. In exchange, all claims were released against these entities for past, present and future coverage obligations arising out of the asbestos coverage-in-place agreements that were the subject of the pending arbitration proceedings. In addition, as part of this settlement, Ashland and Hercules released all claims against National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc. in the Kentucky state court action. As a result, the arbitration proceedings and the Kentucky state court action have been terminated.\nGross profit decreased $28 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Pricing declines, partially offset by lower raw material costs, decreased gross profit by $42 million while lower facility turn around costs in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted in an increase in gross profit of $14 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 decreased 6.8 percentage points to 11.0%.\nOperating cash flows for 2016 included a loss from continuing operations of $283 million, $142 million of net losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements and noncash adjustments of $302 million for depreciation and amortization, and $18 million for debt issuance cost amortization. Operating cash flows for 2016 also included noncash adjustments of $181 million related to the impairment of Intermediates and Solvents.\nAshland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At September 30, 2017, such locations included 82 waste treatment or disposal sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws, 126 current and former operating facilities (including certain operating facilities conveyed as part of the MAP Transaction) and about 1,225 service station properties, of which 61 are being actively remediated.\nAshland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashland's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from Ashland's estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nCash flows provided (used) by operating activities from continuing operations, a major source of Ashland's liquidity, amounted to $255 million in 2017, $372 million in 2016 and $(256) million in 2015. The significant decline in operating cash flow during 2015 related primarily to $610 million of pension contributions, which included a $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution made in June 2015 for plans impacted by a pension settlement program. The $500 million voluntary pension plan contribution was primarily related to Ashland's largest U.S. qualified pension plan which has since been transferred to Valvoline as discussed within Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating income totaled $233 million for 2017 compared to $237 million in 2016. EBITDA decreased $14 million to $462 million in 2017, while Adjusted EBITDA increased $17 million to $493 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2017 to 22.2%.\nAt Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.75%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per annum), based upon Ashland's secured facilities ratings or the consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility through and including the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's secured facilities rating or the consolidated net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower applicable rate). The TLA Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Three-Year TLA Facility will not amortize and will be due on May 17, 2020. The Five-Year TLA Facility will not amortize in each of the first, second and third years and will amortize at a rate of 20% per annum in each of the fourth and fifth years (payable in equal quarterly installments), with the outstanding balance of the Five-Year TLA Facility to be paid on May 17, 2022.\nM-11\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\nM-8\n \u2022 as part of a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, 2016 included a net $1 million of restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation, while 2015 included severance and other costs of $17 million and accelerated depreciation of $6 million; and \nChanges in net working capital accounted for an outflow of $27 million in 2017 and inflows of $26 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were driven by the following:\nAmortization expense recognized on finite-lived intangible assets was $82 million for 2017, $76 million for 2016 and $78 million for 2015, and is primarily included in the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nAshland recognized separation costs of $95 million and $88 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are primarily related to transaction, consulting and legal fees. During 2017 and 2016, $13 million and $7 million, respectively, of the separation costs directly related to Valvoline were included within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. Otherwise, separation costs are recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n \u2022 Accounts receivable - Changes in accounts receivable resulted in a $64 million outflow of cash in 2017 compared to cash inflows of $77 million and $211 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash outflow in 2017 was \nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nFinancing Activities\n \u2022 In 2016, other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, from foreign currency translation adjustments was a loss of $14 million, compared to a loss of $369 million during 2015. The fluctuations in unrealized translation gains and losses are primarily due to translating foreign subsidiary financial statements from local currencies to U.S. Dollars. The prior year was significantly impacted by fluctuations in the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar. \nA Tax Matters Agreement between Ashland and Valvoline Inc. governs the rights and obligations after the spin-off regarding certain income taxes and other taxes, including certain tax liabilities and benefits, attributes, returns and contests.\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2017 decreased 27% compared to 2016, while expenses as a percent of sales decreased 9.7 percentage points. Key drivers of the fluctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2016 were:\n\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales increased $127 million, or 6%, to $2,216 million in 2017. The acquisition of Pharmachem in the current year increased sales by $104 million, or 5%, while a toller agreement exit and the divestiture of a joint venture combined to decrease sales by $13 million. Volume increased sales by $72 million as metric tons increased to 317.2 thousand in 2017, while mix declined sales by $32 million during the current fiscal year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $10 million, while improved product pricing increased sales by $6 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u2022 a $33 million decrease in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 due to fluctuations in adjustments from the losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans; \nCash provided (used) by financing activities was $154 million for 2017, $(1,845) million for 2016, and $(30) million for 2015. Significant cash financing activities for the current year included cash outflows of $915 million primarily related to the full repayment of the 2018 notes and partial repayments of the 2029 notes and 2022 notes. The current year also included cash inflows of $1,100 million from the issuance of the TLA Facilities and the TLB Facility. See further discussion regarding financing activities within the Key Developments\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis herein. Additionally, the current year included short-term debt net cash inflows of $75 million primarily related to debt outstanding on the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and the accounts receivable securitization, partially offset by the repayment of the term loan due 2017. The current year included cash dividends paid of $1.23 per share, for a total of $77 million.\nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2016 included a $12 million impairment related to a Specialty Ingredients joint venture, as well as a gain on the sale of the Kelowna plant and other post-closing adjustments related to previous divestitures of $2 million each.\n \u2022 Separation, restructuring and other costs, net, include the following: \nM-27\nA comparative analysis of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) is provided below for the last three fiscal years ended September 30.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\n (a) Excludes $19 million, $6 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 $4 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Pharmachem during 2017; \nHercules asbestos-related receivables\nOperating income (loss) amounted income of $142 million in 2017, a loss of $127 million in 2016, and income of $112 million in 2015. The current and prior years' operating income include certain key items that are excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. These key items are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline and $4 million of restructuring charges related to office buildings during 2016; \nTangible assets\n\nDuring July 2016, Ashland amended the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement to permit the Reorganization and the series of events relating to the separation of Valvoline Inc. Additionally, the amendment provided that if the aggregate principal amount of the Valvoline debt reaches $750 million, Ashland would be required to use the net proceeds of such borrowings to repay the 2015 term loan facility and/or permanently reduce its existing revolving credit commitments under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. As a result of the July 2016 amendment and the Valvoline debt borrowings in connection with the separation, Ashland reduced its revolving borrowing capacity to $800 million.\n\n \u2022 Discontinued operations, which are reported net of taxes, resulted in income of $133 million, $255 million and $321 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u2022 $9 million, $15 million and $12 million net environmental charges during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; \nM-2\nThe free cash flow metric enables Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - REPORTABLE SEGMENT REVIEW\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, increased $75 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of the following components.\nFree cash flow and other liquidity information\nLong-lived assets\nThe 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix, $87 million of tax expense related to deemed dividend inclusions and a $25 million tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of foreign tax credits.\nDiscontinued Operations Assessment\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nAshland's net income (loss) is primarily affected by results within operating income, net interest and other financing expense, net loss on acquisitions and divestitures, income taxes, discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring. Operating income includes Ashland's adjustment for the immediate recognition of the change in the fair value of the plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans each fiscal year.\nCash flows for discontinued operations in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to net cash outflows of $158 million and net cash inflows of $1,629 million, respectively, related to the activity of Valvoline Inc. The remaining cash flows for discontinued operations for these years related to other previously divested businesses, including net payments of asbestos and environmental liabilities.\nThe remaining unallocated items included charges for restructuring activities of $100 million, $125 million and $41 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Restructuring activities primarily included $82 million and $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline during both 2017 and 2016, respectively, along with stranded divestiture costs of $13 million, $37 million, and $35 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these stranded divestiture costs, $22 million and $23 million related to costs previously allocated to the Valvoline reportable segment during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additional, restructuring activities included $4 million of integration charges during 2017 related to the acquisition of Pharmachem.\nAshland's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, are summarized as follows.\nAny change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.5x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 0.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated net leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.\nAshland had $566 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2017, of which $556 million was held by foreign subsidiaries and had no significant limitations that would prohibit remitting the funds to satisfy corporate obligations. However, if this amount was repatriated to the United States, additional taxes would likely need to be accrued and paid depending on the source of the earnings remitted. Ashland currently has no plans to repatriate any amounts for which additional U.S. taxes would need to be accrued.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's investing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n \u2022 Free cash flow - operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.  Management believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAsbestos litigation\nDebt\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem Laboratories, Inc. (Pharmachem), a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and\nDuring August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility that matured on February 15, 2017. This term loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016 and was fully repaid during 2017.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016; \n \u2022 Inventory - Changes in inventory resulted in a cash outflow of $23 million in 2017 compared to cash inflows of $48 million and $45 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were primarily due to sales volumes and inventory management. \n \u2022 $1 million of net restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility during 2016; and \nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's operating activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCost of sales for 2017 increased $219 million, or 10%, compared to 2016. The Pharmachem acquisition increased cost of sales by $72 million, or 3%, while the net impact of other acquisitions and divestitures increased cost of sales by $9 million. Changes in volume and product mix and higher production costs increased cost of sales by $67 million, or 3%, and 52 million, or 2%, respectively. Favorable currency exchange decreased cost of sales by $7 million.\n \u2022 $13 million of costs related to unplanned plant shutdowns during 2017 include the following: \nAshland's net income was $28 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $28 million in 2016. Ashland's Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5% during 2017 compared to 2016 to $570 million (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation on page M-7). The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to declines in the Unallocated and other reportable segment, where there was a $63 million decrease in pension and other postretirement income in 2017 resulting from the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016. In addition, the prior year included $22 million of previously allocated corporate costs to Valvoline. Excluding these two items, Adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $13 million, or 2%. Reviewing the operational Adjusted EBITDA performance, both Specialty Ingredients and Composites slightly increased while I&S slightly decreased compared to 2016.\n (a) Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold. \n \u2022 $5 million and $15 million charges for legal reserves during 2017 and 2016, respectively; \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets\nM-31\nThe 2015 Term Loan Facility balance was repaid in full in connection with the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities during September 2016. In connection with these transactions, Ashland recognized a $6 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2016.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nDuring 2017, Ashland executed open market repurchases of its 4.750% notes due 2022 (2022 Senior Notes) and its 3.875% notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). As a result of these repurchases, the carrying values of the 2022 and 2018 Senior Notes were reduced by $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Ashland recognized a $3 million charge related to premiums paid in the open market repurchases and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. As previously discussed, the remaining outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes was redeemed during 2017.\nSales by each reportable segment expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nNet income (loss)\nAshland issued its financial outlook for fiscal 2018 as shown in the table below.\nThe significant cash investing activities for 2016 included capital expenditures of $231 million and reimbursements of $33 million from the restricted renewable annual trust established as a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement.\n\nIn conjunction with the July 1, 2016 annual assessment of impairment of goodwill, Ashland's valuation techniques determined that the carrying value of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit exceeded its fair value at July 1, 2016, which resulted in the reporting unit failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Ashland then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which involved, among other things, obtaining third-party appraisals of substantially all of Intermediates and Solvents' tangible and intangible assets. Based on the results of its goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016, Ashland recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is in addition to a $10 million impairment related to Intermediates and Solvents' property, plant and equipment, and resulted in a total $181 million impairment charge for Intermediates and Solvents during 2016.\nSubsequent to completing the distribution of Valvoline Inc. during the current year, Ashland's operations are now managed within the following three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $3 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $2 million and a reduction in bad debt expense of $2 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $2 million compared to 2016.\nStock repurchase programs\nFor the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.\nAshland asbestos-related litigation\n \u2022 $17 million of unrealized gains and $11 million of unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, related to restricted investments, was recognized within other comprehensive income (loss) during 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nEFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nDuring 2017, Ashland's Board of Directors extended this $1 billion share repurchase authorization indefinitely. As further described in the stock repurchase program agreements section below, there is $500 million currently remaining on this authorization.\nM-28\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2017 included a net loss of $5 million from the acquisition of Pharmachem, a loss of $4 million recognized for the Specialty Ingredients joint venture divestiture in China and a loss of $1 million due to post-closing adjustments related to other previous divestitures, partially offset by a net gain of $4 million related to a Composites manufacturing facility.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased $61 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Interest expense increased during the current year primarily due to $92 million of accelerated accretion related to the December 2016 tender offer of the 2029 notes, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower debt levels maintained in 2017 compared to 2016. The current year included interest expense of $9 million related to accelerated debt issuance costs associated with 2017 financing activity, which was comprised of $7 million of accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs immediately recognized, while the prior year included interest expense of $6 million related to accelerated debt issuance costs associated with 2016 financing activity. The increase in other financing costs was primarily due to a net $9 million charge for early redemption premium payments during 2017. The available-for-sale securities income of $11 million compared\n\n \u2022 $5 million and $15 million charges for legal reserves during 2017 and 2016, respectively; and \n \u2022 Net loss on acquisitions and divestitures totaled $6 million, $8 million and $89 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nAccounts receivable securitization\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n \u2022 $6 million, $12 million and $92 million of a net loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; \nTotal Equity\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 12 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Ashland reviews property, plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not limited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group, or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property, plant and equipment asset groups, as well as specific appraisals in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property, plant and equipment asset groups. If the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Various factors that Ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups, and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment asset groups, there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods.\nBusiness results\nThe total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashland's estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, probability techniques, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Ashland's recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $15 million and $23 million, respectively, of which $14 million and $15 million, respectively, were classified in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for items that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashland's 2017 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.\nA summary of the capital employed in Ashland's current operations, which is calculated by adding equity to capital investment, as of the end of the last three years as follows.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to the termination of a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016.  Selling, general and administrative expense for 2016 increased 32% compared to 2015, while expenses as a percent of sales increased 10.1 percentage points. Key drivers of the fluctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2015 were:\nHercules asbestos-related liability\nOn May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem, a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nGross profit increased $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Volume increased gross profit by $15 million while the impact of the manufacturing facility acquisition increased gross profit by $2 million. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $10 million and unfavorable product mix decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 2.8 percentage points to 19.8% as compared to 2016.\nM-30\n \u25e6 $82 million and $81 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline during 2017 and 2016, respectively (which included $2 million of accelerated depreciation during both 2017 and 2016); \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names. These assets had a carrying value of $301 million as of September 30, 2017. Ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Ashland tests these assets using a relief-from-royalty\u201d valuation method compared to the carrying value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include, but are not limited to, such estimates as projected business results, growth rates, weighted-average cost of capital, and royalty rates. The assumptions utilized in the current year models are generally consistent with the prior year models. In conjunction with the July 1 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashland's models did not indicate any impairment, as each indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded their carrying values.\nValvoline met the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation and accordingly, its assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows have been classified as discontinued operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note E within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAshland cash projection\nFinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, and customer relationships. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 25 years, intellectual property over 5 to 25 years and customer and supplier relationships over 3 to 24 years. Ashland reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis.\nPurchase price allocation\n2016 compared to 2015\nCertain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Valvoline reportable segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and continue to be reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were $22 million and $23 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u2022 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) - income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. \nMexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. Ashland has included Pharmachem within the Specialty Ingredients reporting segment.\nGross profit during 2017 increased $18 million compared to 2016. The acquisition of Pharmachem in 2017 increased gross profit by $32 million while improved volume and mix combined to increase gross profit by $21 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases due to pricing and higher costs of $29 million, which included a $32 million impact from the following key items during 2017 and 2016:\nThe following summary reflects Ashland's cash, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nAshland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed.\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A.\nM-26\nThe following table summarizes the key components of the Unallocated and other segment's operating income (loss) for each of the last three years ended September 30.\nIn October 2012, Ashland and Hercules initiated various arbitration proceedings against Underwriters at Lloyd's, certain London companies and/or Chartis (AIG) member companies seeking to enforce these insurers' contractual obligations to provide indemnity for asbestos liabilities and defense costs under existing coverage-in-place agreements. In addition, Ashland and Hercules initiated a lawsuit in Kentucky state court against certain Berkshire Hathaway entities (National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management, Inc.) on grounds that these Berkshire Hathaway entities had wrongfully interfered with Underwriters' and Chartis' performance of their respective contractual obligations to provide asbestos coverage by directing the insurers to reduce and delay certain claim payments.\nSpecialty Ingredients\n\nRedemption of 3.875% notes due 2018\nElastomers results were included in the Composites reportable segment results of operations within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) until its December 1, 2014 sale. For additional information on the divestiture of the Elastomers division, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $181 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to the non-cash long lived asset impairment recorded during 2016. See further discussion of this impairment within the Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements made under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d (MD&A), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Ashland has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d estimates,\u201d is likely,\u201d predicts,\u201d projects,\u201d forecasts,\u201d objectives,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d plans\u201d and intends\u201d and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Ashland may from time to time make forward-looking statements in its Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), news releases and other written and oral communications. These forward-looking statements are based on Ashland's expectations and assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding Ashland's future operating performance and financial condition, as well as the economy and other future events or circumstances. Ashland's expectations and assumptions include, without limitation, those mentioned within the MD&A, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures that Ashland has made or may make, including the acquisition of Pharmachem (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashland's substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashland's future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); the potential that Ashland does not realize all of the expected benefits of the separation of its Valvoline business; and severe weather, natural disasters, cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters). Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are contained in Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties\u201d in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Information on Ashland's website is not incorporated into or a part of this Form 10-K.\n\nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.8, which is below the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the 2017 Credit Agreement of 4.50. At September 30, 2017, Ashland's calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 4.7, which exceeds the minimum required consolidated ratio of 3.0.\nCosts of transaction\nAshland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions, Ashland retained Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. (HR&A). The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, enacted legislation, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, HR&A estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFrom the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A. As a result of the most recent annual update of this estimate, completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased by $16 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $323 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $321 million at September 30, 2016.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.\nAs part of its normal course of business, Ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments. These arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. Ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAshland incurred $15 million of new debt issuance costs in connection with the 2017 Credit Agreement, of which $2 million was expensed immediately during 2017 within the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. The remaining balance is amortized using the effective interest method. Additionally, as a result of the termination of the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement, Ashland recognized a $5 million charge for the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in cost of sales between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and between fiscal years 2016 and 2015.\nAs a result of this settlement, Ashland recorded an after-tax gain of $120 million within the discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) during 2015. The Ashland insurance receivable balance was also reduced as a result of this settlement by $227 million within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u2022 $21 million and $38 million in net environmental-related expenses during 2017 and 2016, respectively; \nto $8 million in the prior year represents investment income related to restricted investments discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe following table reflects the U.S. GAAP calculation for the loss from continuing operations adjusted for the cumulative diluted EPS effect for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table in the previous section. The Adjusted EPS for the loss from continuing operations in the following table has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations since management believes the use of non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.\n \u2022 Operating income (loss) amounted to income of $142 million in 2017, a loss of $127 million in 2016, and income of $112 million in 2015.  For further information on the items reported above, see the discussion in the comparative Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption review analysis.\n\nWater Technologies activity during the current year was related to post-closing adjustments. Water Technologies activity during 2015 related primarily to income of $5 million due to a foreign pension plan remeasurement discussed in Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as other post-closing adjustments.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's financing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment. Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items, which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures, as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA, which may include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.\nThe 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix and net favorable items predominantly due to the release of certain valuation allowances related to state deferred tax assets. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an accrual for an unrecognized tax benefit and tax related to certain global restructuring steps.\nAshland completed the distribution of its remaining 170 million shares of common stock of Valvoline Inc. as a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017. Based on the shares of Ashland common stock outstanding as of May 5, 2017, the record date for the distribution, each share of Ashland common stock received 2.745338 shares of Valvoline common stock in the distribution. The distribution was recorded at the carrying amount of Valvoline Inc.'s net assets which was a deficit of $187 million as of May 12, 2017.\n (a) Excludes the assets and liabilities classified within unallocated and other which primarily includes debt and other long-term liabilities such as asbestos and pension. The net liability in unallocated and other was $3,031 million, $2,479 million and $2,876 million as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nDuring 2015, Ashland announced and completed accelerated share repurchase agreements (2015 ASR Agreements) with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan to repurchase an aggregate of $270 million of Ashland's common stock. Under the 2015 ASR Agreements, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $270 million, split evenly between the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock. The 2015 ASR Agreements had a variable maturity, at the financial institutions option, with a maximum pricing period termination date of July 31, 2015. During 2015, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan exercised their early termination option under the 2015 ASR Agreements and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $125.22 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by the financial institutions under the 2015 ASR Agreements was 2.2 million shares. Ashland received the additional 0.3 million shares from the financial institutions during 2015 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased.\nAshland profile\nThe acquisition was recorded by Ashland using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on respective fair values.\nAshland paid income taxes of $79 million during 2017 compared to $108 million in 2016 and $226 million in 2015. Cash receipts for interest income were $4 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $6 million in 2015, while cash payments for interest expense amounted to $132 million in 2017, $162 million in 2016 and $149 million in 2015.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $600 million seven-year senior secured term loan B facility (the 2017 TLB Facility). At Ashland's option, loans issued under the 2017 TLB Facility bear interest at either (x) LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum. The 2017 TLB Facility may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium if the prepayment is made on or prior to December 14, 2017 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement). The 2017 TLB Facility amortizes at a rate of 1.00% per annum (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the outstanding balance to be paid on May 17, 2024.\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nM-24\nComposites' sales decreased $165 million, or 20%, to $669 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $66 million, or 8%, and the divestiture of the Elastomers division resulted in a loss of sales of $40 million, or 5%. Lower volume decreased sales by $30 million, or 4%, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $20 million, or 2%. Changes in product mix decreased sales by $9 million.\nSenior notes refinancing, 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and 2016 Amendment\nUnallocated and other recorded expense of $146 million, $246 million and $214 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Unallocated and other includes pension and other postretirement net periodic costs and income within continuing operations that have not been allocated to reportable segments. These costs include interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of prior service credit as these items are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level, as opposed to service costs which are allocated to reportable segments. The recurring pension and other postretirement components in Unallocated and other resulted in income of $2 million, $65 million and $44 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unallocated and other also includes gains and losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements which resulted in losses of $6 million, $142 million and $208 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in pension and other postretirement income and remeasurements in the current year is primarily due to the transfer of a substantial portion of the U.S. pension plans to Valvoline Inc. during September 2016.\n \u2022 $7 million of noncash charges related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired from Pharmachem at the date of acquisition during 2017; \nThe all-cash purchase price of Pharmachem was $680 million which included working capital adjustments of approximately $20 million. Ashland incurred $5 million of transaction costs during 2017 related to the acquisition, which was recorded within the net loss on acquisitions and divestitures caption in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note C within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThe following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Intermediates and Solvents. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items such as $7 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a fire during 2017 and the $181 million non-cash long lived asset impairment recorded in 2016. There were no unusual or key items that affected comparability for Adjusted EBITDA during 2015.\n \u25e6 $3 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of an office building during 2017; \nFinancing activities\nOperating income totaled $63 million in 2016 compared to $61 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $3 million to $85 million in 2016. EBITDA margin increased 2.1 percentage points to 12.7% in 2016.\n2017 Credit Agreement\n \u25e6 $27 million of restructuring costs (including $6 million of accelerated depreciation and $17 million related to the restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility) during 2015; \nOperating Activities - Summary\nTotal equity and other income decreased $7 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease from nonrecurring tax consulting income recorded during 2015.\nM-20\nAs of September 30, 2017 and 2016, the receivables from insurers amounted to $68 million and $63 million, respectively. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $5 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\nAshland debt covenant restrictions\nThe Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashland's management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nM-36\nAshland's reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $163 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $177 million at September 30, 2016, of which $121 million at September 30, 2017 and $134 million at September 30, 2016 were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGross profit decreased $12 million during 2017 compared to 2016. Pricing effects were offset by higher costs to decrease gross profit by $12 million, which included the impact of higher facility turn around costs of $9 million and incremental costs of $7 million related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a fire. Higher volumes increased gross profit by $2 million which was offset by unfavorable product mix of $2 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 4.5 percentage points to 6.5%.\nEnvironmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland's ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $416 million. The largest reserve for any site is approximately 15% of the remediation reserve.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nCost of sales for 2016 decreased $379 million, or 15%, compared to 2015 primarily due to lower production costs, changes in volume and product mix, and the net impact of the acquisition and divestiture of certain divisions and product lines. These factors decreased cost of sales by $119 million, or 5%, $76 million, or 3%, and $69 million, or 3%, respectively. Favorable foreign currency exchange decreased cost of sales by $40 million.\nIntermediates and Solvents' sales decreased $62 million, or 19%, to $261 million in 2016. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $45 million, or 14%, while changes in product mix decreased sales by $15 million, or 5%. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $6 million while higher volume levels increased sales by $4 million.\nOperating loss totaled $12 million in 2017 as compared to $181 million in 2016. EBITDA increased $169 million to $19 million in 2017, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5 million to $26 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 2.1 percentage points to 9.8% in 2017.\nPharmachem Acquisition\n \u2022 Trade and other payables - Changes in trade and other payables resulted in a cash inflow of $60 million in 2017 compared to cash outflows of $99 million and $228 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were primarily driven by fluctuations in trade payables and incentive compensation payouts from the prior year paid during the first quarter of each fiscal year. During 2014, there were increased accruals for incentive compensation and severance related to the 2014 global restructuring which resulted in large cash outflows in 2015.  The remaining cash outflow of $15 million in 2017, cash inflow of $17 million in 2016 and cash outflow of $282 million in 2015 were primarily due to income taxes paid or income tax refunds, interest paid, and adjustments to certain accruals and long term assets and liabilities.\nM-1\n \u2022 $7 million of noncash charges related to the fair value assessment of inventory acquired from Pharmachem at the date of acquisition during 2017; \nIn November 2015, under the 2015 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2016 ASR Agreement) with Goldman Sachs & Co. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $500 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock during November 2015. In February 2016, Goldman Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 2016 ASR Agreement and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland's common stock over the pricing period less a discount, was $99.01 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by Ashland that were delivered by Goldman Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASR Agreement was 5.1 million shares. Ashland received the additional 1.2 million shares during 2016 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased. After the 2016 ASR Agreement, $500 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the 2015 stock repurchase authorization.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions, for example, the life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the expected return on pension plan assets yet excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses, provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Ashland's operating performance (see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table on page M-7 for additional details on exact amounts included within this non-GAAP measure related to pension and other postretirement plans.) Management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (and in particular interest rates) that are not directly related to the underlying business. For further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above, see Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures were $199 million for 2017 and averaged $217 million during the last three years. A summary of capital expenditures by reportable segment during 2017, 2016 and 2015 follow.\nDuring 2015, Ashland's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization (the 2015 stock repurchase program) that was set to expire on December 31, 2017. This authorization allows for common shares to be repurchased in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or Rule 10b5-1 plans.\n\nCapital resources\nHercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules' former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\nGross profit decreased $9 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower volume and product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $11 million while pricing effects were more than offset by lower costs, increasing gross profit by $10 million. The sale of Elastomers and unfavorable foreign currency exchange each decreased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 3.4 percentage points as compared to 2015 to 22.6%.\nDuring the most recent update completed during 2017, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $36 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $419 million at September 30, 2017 compared to $415 million at September 30, 2016.\n \u2022 EBITDA - net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization. \nThe significant cash investing activities for 2015 included capital expenditures of $220 million and proceeds of $139 million from divestitures which primarily included $105 million from the sale of the Elastomers division and approximately $30 million from the sale of industrial biocides assets. Funds restricted for specific transactions represent the receipt of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement funds of $335 million into a restricted renewable annual trust, partially offset by the reclassification into cash and cash equivalents of $15 million of assets previously restricted in use for property transactions. Additionally, the purchase of and proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $315 million related to investment activity involving equity and corporate bond funds within the asbestos trust.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED REVIEW\nThe claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.\n \u2022 $16 million of tax indemnity income and a $7 million charge for a stock incentive plan award modification during 2015.  Operating income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included depreciation and amortization of $301 million, $302 million and $306 million, respectively (which includes accelerated depreciation of $19 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, for each year).\nComposites\nAshland's sales generated outside of North America were 60% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Sales by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated sales were as follows:\nCash provided by discontinued operations\nInvesting activities\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA, which can include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales. \n2017 compared to 2016\nAshland asbestos-related liability\nThe minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2017 Credit Agreement during is 3.0. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period.\n\n \u2022 2016 included $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment while 2015 included a $13 million charge related to a customer claim.  Additionally, gross profit within the energy market decreased $17 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of lower volumes. The remaining gross profit decline of $47 million compared to 2015 was partially due to planned plant turnarounds, which reduced gross profit by $19 million during 2016, while lower costs, primarily raw materials, was offset by pricing declines. Volume and changes in product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $13 million while unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross profit by $11 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets decreased gross profit by $4 million during 2016. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 1.5 percentage points to 33.9% as compared to 2015.\n \u2022 In 2017, the unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency translation adjustments was income of $81 million, compared to a loss of $14 million during 2016. The fluctuations in unrealized translation gains and losses are primarily due to translating foreign subsidiary financial statements from local currencies to U.S. Dollars. \n (a) Fiscal 2015 includes $40 million of sales from the divested Elastomers division for the period October 1, 2014 through the completion of the sale on December 1, 2014. See Note D within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n (a) Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation.  Reportable segments\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the change in sales between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and between fiscal years 2016 and 2015.\n \u2022 Ashland incurred pretax net interest and other financing expense of $234 million, $173 million and $174 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was impacted by certain charges associated with debt financing activity during each year. \n \u25e6 $7 million of restructuring costs (including $4 million of accelerated depreciation, a $5 million income adjustment to the previously recorded accrual for a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, $4 million of charges related to the exit from a toller agreement and restructuring of a manufacturing facility, and $4 million of charges related to the restructuring of office buildings) during 2016; and \n \u2022 $6 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a manufacturing plant due to a hurricane during 2017; \n\nOn September 22, 2015, Ashland announced that the Board of Directors approved proceeding with a plan to separate Ashland into two independent, publicly traded companies comprising of the new Ashland (now known as Ashland Global Holdings Inc.) and Valvoline Inc. The initial step of the separation, the initial public offering (IPO) of Valvoline Inc., closed on September 28, 2016. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriters' discount and other offering expenses received from the IPO were $712 million, which were used primarily to repay debt incurred prior to the IPO and retained for Valvoline Inc.'s cash on hand. As discussed further within the Final Separation section, Ashland completed the distribution of its remaining shares in Valvoline Inc. on May 12, 2017. The new Ashland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets. Key markets and applications include pharmaceutical, personal care, food and beverage, architectural coatings, adhesives, automotive, construction and energy.\n\nOperating income totaled $67 million in 2017 compared to $63 million in 2016. EBITDA increased $4 million to $89 million in 2017, while the EBITDA margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 11.4% in 2017.\n \u2022 $17 million of restructuring charges related the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility during 2017 (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation); \nPension and other postretirement net periodic costs (income) reduced cost of sales by $13 million compared to 2016, while charges for unplanned plant shutdowns increased cost of sales by $13 million. Other key items combined to increase cost of sales by $26 million compared to 2016.\nAt September 30, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to CVG was $155 million and $133 million, respectively. There were $56 million of borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2017, while Ashland had no borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2016. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 2.8% for 2017 and 1.5% for 2016.\nAfter completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares on May 12, 2017, Ashland owned 170 million shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock which represented approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock. As a result, Ashland continued to consolidate Valvoline within the Consolidated Financial Statements up until the distribution of the remaining shares. The resulting outside stockholders' interests in Valvoline Inc., which was approximately 17% as of September 30, 2016, was presented separately as a noncontrolling interest within Ashland's equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributed to these previous minority holders was presented as a separate caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nThe following discloses the cash flows associated with Ashland's discontinued operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashland's most recent credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) is 4.50. The 2017 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2017 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, noncash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page M-7. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker's acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees.\nSignificant cash financing activities during 2016 included the repayment of long-term debt of $1,095 million primarily related to the 2015 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, 2016 included a cash outflow of $500 million for the repurchase of common stock and short-term net debt repayments of $156 million primarily related to the debt repayments under Ashland's 2015 revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility, and the issuance of the $150 million term loan facility due 2017. Ashland also paid cash dividends of $1.56 per share, for a total of $97 million.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\nAccounts receivable securitization\nM-4\nOperating Activities - Operating Assets and Liabilities\nComposites' sales increased $110 million to $779 million in 2017. Volume increased sales by $59 million, or 9%, as metric tons increased to 346.4 thousand in 2017. Improved product pricing increased sales by $35 million, or 5%, while the acquisition of an unsaturated polyester resins manufacturing facility in the current year increased sales by $22 million, or 3%. Unfavorable product mix decreased sales by $6 million.\n2017 compared to 2016\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029\nOperating cash flows for 2015 included a loss from continuing operations of $12 million, $208 million of net losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements and noncash adjustments of $306 million for depreciation and amortization, and $18 million for debt issuance cost amortization, as well as the previously discussed $610 million of pension contributions.\nM-18\nIn December 2016, Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, repurchased, through a cash tender offer, $182 million of the aggregate principal par value amount of its 6.50% junior subordinated notes due 2029 (2029 Notes) for an aggregate purchase price of $177 million. As a result, the carrying value of the 2029 Notes was reduced by $90 million and Ashland recognized a $92 million charge related to accelerated accretion of the recorded debt discount (compared to the total par value) and $5 million of a net gain related to the repayment of the debt during 2017. The charge and net gain are included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\n\n \u2022 an increase of $181 million due to the impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \nFor the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management's interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent.\nIncome taxes\nM-22\nThe following discussion outlines significant transactions announced or executed during 2017.\nNew Reportable Segments\nM-29\nUnallocated and other\nAsbestos litigation cost projection\nDuring 2017, the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on Ashland's current and future cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nDuring June of 2015, Ashland completed certain refinancing transactions related to the $600 million 3.000% senior notes due in 2016 (2016 Senior Notes). Ashland commenced and completed a cash tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 2016 Senior Notes. At the close of the tender offer, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes was tendered by note holders, representing approximately 92% of the outstanding 2016 Senior Notes, which have been purchased by Ashland. Subsequently, Ashland redeemed the remaining balance of the 2016 Senior Notes of $50 million on July 23, 2015.\nDuring 2015, Ashland used the proceeds from borrowings under the $1.1 billion term loan facility along with cash on hand (i) to fund the tender offer of the 2016 Senior Notes, (ii) to prepay in full the outstanding loans under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, (iii) to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the 2016 Senior Notes, (iv) to contribute funds to the U.S. pension plans impacted by the pension plan settlement program, and (v) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the entry into the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement. As a result of the tender offer and redemption, Ashland recognized a $9 million charge related to early redemption premium payments, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2015.\n \u25e6 $6 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of a Specialty Ingredients manufacturing plant due to a hurricane; \nIn connection with the tender offer and redemption, in June 2015, Ashland entered into a new Credit Agreement (the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement replaced the $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 Senior Credit Facility), and was comprised of a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility), which included a $250 million letter of credit sublimit and a $100 million swing line loan sublimit, and a five-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the 2015 term loan facility). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement was not guaranteed, was unsecured and could be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.\n2016 compared to 2015\nM-6\n (a) Excludes changes resulting from operations acquired or sold. \nHercules asbestos-related litigation\nOperating income (loss)\nSubsidiary senior unsecured term loan\n \u2022 a decrease of $181 million due to the impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \n (c) Includes leases for office buildings, retail outlets, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. For further information, see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nKey factors that affected Ashland's conclusion that an impairment of the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 included the continued deterioration in the butanediol commodity market during 2016. Market conditions for butanediol, a commodity chemical used in the production of polymers, solvents and fine chemicals, can vary significantly from year to year or even quarter to quarter. Throughout 2016, increasing levels of overcapacity for butanediol in the market, particularly in China, and the resulting weak pricing had a cumulating negative impact on the financial performance of the Intermediates and Solvents division. Butanediol commodity contract prices had fallen consistently during 2016. These factors contributed significantly to lower expected EBITDA results within the longer-term forecast period. Ashland prepares its annual forecast mid-August through October each year. As the 2016 forecast was developed, Ashland considered many factors when assessing the outlook for 2017 and beyond. Because of these factors, Ashland revised its forecasts down significantly, which ultimately led to the goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge for the Intermediates and Solvents reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe following table aggregates Ashland's obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at September 30, 2017. Contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable have been excluded.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for noncontrolling interests, discontinued operations, net gain (loss) on acquisitions and divestitures, other income and (expense) and key items (including the remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans). \nEnvironmental remediation and asset retirement obligations\nallocation of goodwill are its three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. The reporting units changed from prior years due to Ashland completing the distribution of Valvoline during the current year.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAshland's financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, as a result, do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) lose purchasing power as a result of inflation, while monetary liabilities (such as accounts payable and indebtedness) result in a gain, because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power. As of September 30, 2017, Ashland's monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities, leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation. However, given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the United States in the past decade as well as forward economic outlooks, current inflationary pressures seem moderate.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Specialty Ingredients. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland's operations, which exclude certain key items. The key items within the current year related to $17 million restructuring charges for the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation and $3 million of severance and other restructuring costs), $7 million for the revaluation of Pharmachem inventory, $6 million of charges related to an unplanned plant shutdown and $1 million of severance costs. The prior year included $4 million of restructuring charges, partially offset by a $5 million income adjustment to a severance accrual, while 2015 included $17 million of severance and other costs related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan during 2015. The $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan. The $13 million adjustment during 2015 related to a customer claim which was subsequently adjusted by $5 million during 2016. There were environmental reserve adjustments of $2 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impairment of $11 million during 2015 relates to certain in-process research and development assets associated with a previous acquisition.\nOther Financing Activities\nResearch and development expense during 2017 remained relatively consistent with the expense in 2016.\nThe following EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Composites. There were no unusual or key items that affected comparability for EBITDA during the current and prior years.\nThe following details certain changes in key operating assets and liabilities for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOn May 17, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the Pharmachem acquisition, Ashland entered into a secured credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with a group of lenders. The 2017 Credit Agreement provided for (i) a $250 million three-year term loan A facility (the Three-Year TLA Facility), (ii) a $250 million five-year term loan A facility (the Five-Year TLA Facility and together with the Three-Year TLA Facility, the TLA Facilities) and (iii) a $680 million five-year revolving credit facility (including a $125 million letter of credit sublimit) (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of borrowings under the TLA Facilities were used solely to finance the acquisition of Pharmachem, while the proceeds of the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of Pharmachem, to refinance the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. On May 19, 2017, Ashland entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility from $680 million to $800 million.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\nExcluding the $181 million impairment charge recorded during 2016 that was previously discussed in the 2017 compared to 2016\u201d narrative, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2 million primarily due to employee related costs.\nLiquidity\nOperating cash flows for 2017 included a loss from continuing operations of $105 million, $6 million of net losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements and noncash adjustments of $301 million for depreciation and amortization, and $109 million for original issue discount and debt issuance cost amortization, including $92 million of accelerated accretion related to the tender offer of the 2029 notes.\nDuring May 2017, subsequent to the final distribution of Valvoline Inc.'s common stock, the Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 22.5 cents per share to eligible shareholders at record. This amount was paid for quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 and represents a reduction from the previous quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share.\nM-16\n\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets Ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative income or loss. In addition, Ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\n\n\n (a) Includes raw material and service contracts where minimal committed quantities and prices are fixed. \nM-14\nM-23\nThe following table shows sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization and statistical operating information by reportable segment for each of the last three years ended September 30.\nAshland is a premier global leader in providing specialty chemical solutions to customers in a wide range of consumer and industrial markets, including adhesives, architectural coatings, automotive, construction, energy, food and beverage, personal care and pharmaceutical. With approximately 6,500 employees worldwide, Ashland serves customers in more than 100 countries.\nAshland asbestos-related receivables\nprovide Ashland's investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by Ashland's management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashland's historical operating performance and its business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nDuring the December 2015 quarter, the Transfer and Administration Agreement was amended to extend the termination date of the accounts receivable securitization facility from December 31, 2015 to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement. No other changes to the agreement within the current or prior year amendments are expected to have a significant impact to Ashland's results of operations and financial position.\nResults of Ashland's reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashland's reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded to Unallocated and other. Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashland's methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis.\nThe credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland Chemco Inc. and Ashland LLC's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of Ashland and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Ashland's domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. The guarantees by Ashland's subsidiaries and pledge of security interests by such guarantors may, at Ashland's option, be released upon and during the occurrence of a Collateral Release Event (as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement).\nSales for 2016 decreased $401 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Pricing declines and lower volumes decreased sales by $157 million, or 5% percent, and $88 million, or 3%, respectively. Divestitures of certain divisions and product lines decreased sales by $78 million, or 2%, unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $54 million, and product mix decreased sales by $24 million.\n (f) Ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business. For further information, see Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (b) Includes $8 million, $(42) million and $(22) million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of net periodic pension and other postretirement costs (income) recognized ratably through the fiscal year. These costs (income) are comprised of service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credit and are disclosed in further detail in Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAshland entered into settlement agreements totaling $5 million and $4 million with certain insurers during 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in a reduction of the Ashland insurance receivable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the same amount.\nThe following represents Ashland's calculation of free cash flow for the disclosed periods and reconciles free cash flow to cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Free cash flow does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. See Results of Operations - Consolidated Review - Use of non-GAAP measures\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 $17 million of incremental costs related to Pharmachem's operations and $4 million of Pharmachem integration costs during 2017; \nProjecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, mortality rates, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately 40 to 50 year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $660 million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $419 million) and approximately $510 million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of $323 million), depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nComposites is a global leader in unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl ester resins and gelcoats. The Composites business manufactures and sells a broad range of general-purpose and high-performance grades of unsaturated polyester and vinyl ester resins, gelcoats and low-profile additives for the reinforced plastics industry. The products in the Composites business provide an array of functional properties including corrosion resistance, fire retardance, ultraviolet resistance, water and chemical resistance, high mechanical strength, impact and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios. Key end markets include transportation, construction, marine and infrastructure. In addition, the business manufactures and sells molten maleic anhydride for the manufacture of a variety of products such as unsaturated polyester resins, copolymers, lubricating oil additives, alkenyl succinic anhydrides, malic acid, fumaric acid and numerous derivative chemicals. Key markets include composites, personal care, dispersants and paper sizing.\nAs a result of the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement previously described, Hercules resolved all disputes with Chartis (AIG) member companies under their existing coverage-in-place agreement for past, present and future Hercules asbestos claims. As a result, during 2015, a $22 million reduction in the insurance receivable balance within the Consolidated Balance Sheets was recorded.\nPension and other postretirement plans expense decreased cost of sales by $40 million, primarily as a result of decreased remeasurement losses in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to fluctuations in discount rates. Key items primarily related to severance and other costs and customer claim adjustments resulted in a $35 million decrease to cost of sales in 2016 compared to 2015.\nM-34\n \u2022 $11 million impairment charge related to certain in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets associated with the acquisition of International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP) in 2011 during 2015; and \nAshland reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The annual assessment is performed as of July 1 and consists of Ashland determining each reporting unit's current fair value compared to its current carrying value. Ashland determined that its reporting units for the\nStockholder dividends\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $12 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declines in employee related costs of $6 million, the sale of the Elastomers division of $3 million and favorable foreign currency exchange of $3 million. Equity and other income (loss) decreased $1 million during 2016 compared to 2015.\n (d) Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of September 30, 2017. \nSales by region expressed as a percentage of reportable segment sales for each of the last three fiscal years ended September 30 were as follows. Ashland includes only U.S. and Canada in its North American designation.\nIn connection with the 2017 TLB Facility, Ashland redeemed all of its outstanding 3.875% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes), of which approximately $659 million were outstanding. Proceeds of borrowings under the 2017 TLB Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to pay for the redemption. Ashland recognized a $13 million charge related to premiums paid and accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs during 2017, which is included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.\nOpen market repurchases of 4.750% notes due 2022 and 3.875% notes due 2018\n2017 Credit Agreement\nIntermediates and Solvents' sales increased $4 million to $265 million in 2017. The net impact of volume and product pricing increased sales by $7 million with metric tons sold increasing to 137.0 thousand. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower product pricing, which decreased sales by $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\nContractual obligations and other commitments\n (e) Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, Ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. Therefore, these amounts were included in the More than 5 years\u201d column. \n (b) Sales are defined as sales and operating revenues. Gross profit is defined as sales, less cost of sales. \nSince Ashland's ownership interest in Valvoline Inc. was approximately 83% after completing the IPO on September 28, 2016 and before the distribution of its remaining shares of Valvoline on May 12, 2017, the amount of net income attributable to the outside stockholders' approximately 17% noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc. was presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP within this caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2017 and 2016.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \u2022 $181 million impairment related to the Intermediates and Solvents reportable segment during 2016; \nM-17\nAshland's reporting structure is composed of three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. For further descriptions of each reportable segment, see Results of Operations - Reportable Segment Review\u201d beginning on page M-13.\n\nOn August 31, 2012, Ashland entered into a $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to (i) a Sale Agreement, among Ashland and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an Originator and collectively, the Originators) and CVG Capital III LLC, a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote\u201d special purpose subsidiary of the Originators (CVG) and (ii) a Transfer and Administration Agreement, among CVG, each Originator, Ashland, as Master Servicer, certain Conduit Investors, Uncommitted Investors, Letter of Credit Issuers, Managing Agents, Administrators and Committed Investors, and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as agent for various secured parties (the Agent). The Transfer and Administration Agreement had a term of three years, but was extendable at the discretion of Ashland and the Investors. During 2016, the termination date of the commitments under the Transfer and Administration Agreement was extended from December 31, 2015, the previous termination extension date, to March 22, 2017. During the March 2017 quarter, this facility was extended for an additional year with similar terms as the previous facility agreement.\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on Ashland, see Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSubsequent to completing the distribution of Valvoline Inc. during the current year, Ashland's operations are now managed within the following three reportable segments: Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents. In previous years, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents were reporting units included within the Ashland Performance Materials reportable segment.\n \u2022 $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment during 2016.  Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and the divestiture of a joint ventures decreased gross profit by $4 million and $2 million, respectively. In total, gross profit margin during 2017 decreased 1.2 percentage points to 32.7% as compared to 2016.\n \u25e6 $17 million of restructuring charges related the closure of a manufacturing plant and the termination of a contract at a manufacturing facility during 2017 (which included $14 million of accelerated depreciation); \nCertain of the industries in which Ashland operates are capital-intensive, and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs. Accordingly, depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs. However, because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies, such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities, mitigating at least part of the increased expense.\nM-3\n\n\n\nGross profit during 2016 decreased $26 million compared to 2015. Gross profit included certain key items during 2016 and 2015 as follows:\n \u25e6 $7 million of costs related to the temporary shutdown of an Intermediates and Solvents manufacturing plant due to a fire; and \n\nprimarily the result of increased accounts receivable due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015.\n (b) Includes estimated funding of Ashland's qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans for 2018 as well as projected benefit payments through 2027 under Ashland's unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Excludes the benefit payments from the pension plan trust funds. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nTotal equity increased $241 million since September 30, 2016 to $3,406 million at September 30, 2017. The increase of $241 million was primarily due to $187 million related to the distribution of Valvoline Inc., $27 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc., $81 million related to deferred translation gains, $15 million for common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans and $15 million of a net change in the gain on available-for-sale securities. These increases were partially offset by $77 million of regular cash dividends.\nStock repurchase program agreements\n (a) Excludes $14 million, $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nNet loss on acquisitions and divestitures during 2015 primarily included the pre-tax loss on sale related to Elastomers of $86 million, as well as a net $3 million loss due to other post-closing adjustments related to previous divestitures.\nThe borrowing capacity remaining under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility was $579 million due to an outstanding balance of $173 million, as well as a reduction of $48 million for letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2017. In total, Ashland's available liquidity position, which includes cash, the revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility, was $1,180 million at September 30, 2017 as compared to $1,839 million at September 30, 2016 and $2,280 million at September 30, 2015. For further information, see Note I within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAshland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:\nM-33\nM-35\n \u2022 Ashland's net income attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to $27 million and $1 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and reflects the noncontrolling interest of Valvoline Inc. for the period after the IPO close on September 28, 2016 and before the final distribution occurred on May 12, 2017. \nOperating income (loss) totaled a loss of $181 million in 2016 as compared to income of $26 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $208 million to a loss of $150 million in 2016, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $27 million to $31 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 6.1 percentage points to 11.9% in 2016.\n \u2022 $11 million of income related to the termination of a legacy benefit for former directors during 2016; and \nEBITDA reconciliation\nAt Ashland's option, borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The loans' interest rate fluctuated between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.50% per annum), based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility through and including June 30, 2015, and thereafter the fee rate fluctuated between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland's corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee rate).\nSpecialty Ingredients' sales decreased $174 million, or 8%, to $2,089 million in 2016. Energy market sales decreased $55 million compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volume as a result of reduced demand by customers, specifically those within industries negatively impacted by a low oil price environment. In addition, pricing declines reduced sales by $45 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets and the exit from the redispersible powders product line decreased sales by $24 million and $11 million, respectively. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and changes in volume and product mix combined decreased sales by $27 million and $12 million, respectively.\n \u2022 a $98 million decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 due to fluctuations in adjustments from the losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans; \nAt September 30, 2017, Ashland's receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to $155 million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims). Receivables from insurers amounted to $151 million at September 30, 2016. During 2017, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers, was completed. This model update resulted in a $15 million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.\n \u2022 $13 million charge related to a customer claim during 2015 and a subsequent $5 million income adjustment to the customer claim during 2016; \nCredit Agreements and Refinancing\nM-12\nGoodwill\nIntermediates and Solvents is a leading producer of 1,4 butanediol (BDO) and related derivatives, including tetrahydrofuran and n-methylpyrrolidone. These products are used as chemical intermediates in the production of engineering polymers and polyurethanes, and as specialty process solvents in a wide array of applications including electronics, pharmaceuticals, water filtration membranes and more. Butanediol is also supplied to Ashland's Specialty Ingredients business for use as a raw material.\nAdditional capital resources\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) - caption review\n \u2022 The pension and postretirement obligation adjustment was a loss of $4 million during 2017 compared to income of $14 million during 2016. Of these amounts, $4 million and $41 million during the current and prior years, respectively, of unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans were amortized and reclassified into net income. Additional unrecognized prior service credits, net of tax, of $55 million during 2016 were included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements. \n\nAsbestos-related activity during the current and prior years included the after-tax net adjustments to the asbestos reserves and receivables of $25 million and $30 million, respectively. The net gain of $110 million during 2015 included an after-tax gain of $120 million related to the January 2015 asbestos insurance settlement, partially offset by after-tax net expense adjustments to the asbestos reserves and receivables, including the adjustments for changes in estimates as well as a deferred tax adjustment.\n \u2022 $6 million, $142 million and $208 million related to pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement losses during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the immediate recognition from the change in fair value of the plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans; \n (c) Excludes income of $4 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to ongoing adjustments of previous divestiture transactions.
