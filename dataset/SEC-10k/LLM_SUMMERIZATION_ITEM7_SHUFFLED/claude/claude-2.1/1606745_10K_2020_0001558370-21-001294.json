Therefore, the executive summary below contains the strategies and challenges of Tripadvisor for an understanding of the business objectives of Tripadvisor.\nTripadvisor's Long-term Growth Strategy\nTripadvisor's long-term growth strategy aims to increase customer engagement on its platform and drive profitable growth through:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>building products that delight travelers by reducing friction throughout the travel planning and trip-taking journey; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>driving consumer loyalty to Tripadvisor's platform by offering products and services that increase engagement with Tripadvisor's platform and result in membership growth, mobile app engagement and repeat usage; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>investing in technology (e.g. machine learning) to further improve the experiences Tripadvisor can deliver to consumers and travel partners on its platform; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>deepening travel partner engagement on Tripadvisor's platform by expanding the number of products and services offered; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>leveraging its platform's unique attributes to expand and grow its offerings, such as hotel business to business ( B2B\u201d) services, direct-to-consumer products and services where consumers pay Tripadvisor on a per trip </td> </tr>\n</table>\nII-2\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>planned or annual subscription basis, both click-based and display-based media advertising, and experiences and restaurants; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>driving operational efficiencies; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>opportunistically pursuing strategic acquisitions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of Tripadvisor's long-term growth strategy, it favors continuous product innovation in order to deliver customers more value. In this regard, Tripadvisor beta-launched a direct-to-consumer annual subscription-based offering in December 2020.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Tripadvisor's Business\nThe online travel industry is large and highly dynamic and competitive. Tripadvisor's overall strategy is to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners in order to generate more monetization on its platform. While Tripadvisor operates with a long-term growth focus, its specific growth objectives and resource allocation strategies can differ in both duration and magnitude within its segments. Descriptions of these dynamics, as well as the current trends affecting its overall business and reportable segments, key drivers of financial results, and uncertainties that may impact Tripadvisor's ability to execute on its objectives and strategies, are below.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industry and consequently adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2020. Among other impacts, COVID-19 has negatively impacted global consumer demand and consumers' ability to travel, thereby resulting in many of Tripadvisor's travel partners operating at significantly reduced service levels.\nCommencing in late February 2020 and progressively worsening through March 2020, Tripadvisor experienced a significant decline in user demand for its products and services, concurrent with intensifying concerns about COVID-19 on a global basis, in conjunction with widespread travel restrictions imposed by governments and businesses. The adverse impact to Tripadvisor's business from COVID-19 intensified in the second half of March, driven by the pandemic's proliferation and increased governmental restrictions and mandates globally that additionally impacted the travel, hospitality, restaurant and leisure industry and further dampened consumer demand for Tripadvisor's products and services. In the second half of March and throughout April, significant year-over-year revenue declines generally stabilized across Tripadvisor's segments and products which generally continued throughout the second quarter of 2020, and modestly improved during the third quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 40% of the prior year's comparable period. In the second half of 2020, Tripadvisor's revenue averaged approximately 35% of the prior year's comparable period, while revenue performance in the months of November and December was approximately 33% of the prior year's comparable periods. This trend compares favorably to the trends observed in months of April 2020 and May 2020, where Tripadvisor's revenue for those months was approximately 10% of the prior year's comparable periods. In addition, traffic trends on Tripadvisor's websites have improved since the significant declines seen in the second half of March and throughout April 2020. In the second half of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites averaged approximately 67% of the prior year's comparable periods, while in April and May of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites were approximately 33% and 45%, respectively, of the prior year's comparable periods, respectively. While Tripadvisor's revenue and traffic trends generally improved since April and May 2020, these trends began to flatten out in September 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted these recent trends, as monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites during the fourth quarter of 2020 declined to approximately 60% of the prior year's comparable period, in comparison to approximately 70% of the prior year's comparable period, during the third quarter of 2020.\nTripadvisor has also incurred significant and unanticipated cancellations by travelers related to future travel, accommodations and tour bookings, which had been reserved by travelers in the pre-COVID-19 timeframe, and included a significant number of bookings recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. During the course of 2020,\nII-3\nTripadvisor has worked with travelers and travel partners to address cancellations, re-bookings, and in certain cases it has provided its travel partners extended payment terms, discounts and other incentives.\nWhile we have seen varying degrees of containment of the virus in certain countries and some signs of travel recovery during points in time during 2020, the degree of containment and the recovery in travel has varied region-to-region globally, as well as state-to-state in the U.S. Most notably, a resurgence of COVID-19 has occurred again, after a period of decline, during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, followed by the reinstatement of government restrictions and mandates in certain geographies globally and the identification of new variants of the virus. There remains uncertainty around when remaining or reinstated restrictions will be lifted, where additional restrictions may be initiated, or where restrictions that have been previously lifted may be reinstated due to resurgence of the virus, nor is it clear when the short or long-term changes to consumer usage patterns on its platform or travel behavior patterns when travel bans and other government restrictions and mandates are fully lifted, or the timing of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine globally. Tripadvisor believes the travel industry and its business will continue to be materially and adversely affected while such travel restrictions remain in place and COVID-19 continues to proliferate. Although Tripadvisor cannot predict with certainty the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its full year 2021 financial results, it currently expects that its first quarter 2021 financial results will continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic to a material degree.\nIn addition, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on travel, regional and global markets, and overall economic activity remains difficult to predict. Therefore, the ultimate extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remains largely uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued resurgence and severity of the virus, continued transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the timing or extent of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine, mobility and travel restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on consumer travel behavior.\nIn response to the impact of COVID-19, Tripadvisor has taken several steps to further strengthen its financial position and balance sheet, and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility during 2020, including, but not limited to, restructuring activities, reducing its ongoing operating expenses and headcount, additional borrowings of debt, and amendments to Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility, all of which are described in more detail below.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility (as defined below) as a precautionary measure to reinforce its liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings during the third quarter of 2020. In May 2020, Tripadvisor amended its 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor (such period, the Leverage Covenant Holiday\u201d), add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility, to among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance under the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor (the Covenant Changeover Date\u201d), at which time the leverage ratio covenant will be reinstated. At this time, Tripadvisor also downsized the capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. Tripadvisor believes this additional flexibility will be important given its continued limited ability to predict its future financial performance due to the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, as well as consumer behavior, and restrictive measures put in place in response to COVID-19.\nIn addition, in July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private offering. The Indenture pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued provides, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes at 7.000% per annum, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. Tripadvisor used the net proceeds received of $490 million, net of deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its 2015 Credit Facility borrowings.\nII-4\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor instituted a cost reduction initiative to preserve cash flows, including targeted workforce reduction measures largely in the Experiences & Dining segment and optimizing and reducing brand advertising as Tripadvisor pivots to leverage newer mediums it believes will be more effective than its historically television-focused campaign.\nDuring the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor instituted additional cost reduction measures, including the elimination of the majority of discretionary spending, business travel, non-critical vendor relationships, brand advertising, cessation of nearly all new hiring and contingent staff, reduction of targeted employee benefits, and the furloughing of over 100 employees. On April 28, 2020, management approved and Tripadvisor announced an additional cost reduction initiative in response to the continued economic and financial impacts to Tripadvisor as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included the following:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Enacting a workforce reduction eliminating more than 900 employees; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Furloughing additional employees bringing the total furloughed employees during March and April 2020 to approximately 850 employees, primarily in Tripadvisor's European operations at TheFork; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Making targeted reductions of Tripadvisor's office lease portfolio, primarily either through subleasing or allowing property leases to expire. </td> </tr>\n</table> By the end of the third quarter of 2020, a majority of Tripadvisor's previously furloughed employees had returned to their jobs. However, during the fourth quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor again furloughed approximately 400 employees, primarily in its European operations of TheFork. This action taken by Tripadvisor was a direct result of the reinstatement of government restrictions related to restaurants in various countries within Europe, in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in those markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor incurred total pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of approximately $41 million as a result of these measures, all of which were paid by Tripadvisor as of December 31, 2020.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes numerous income tax provisions, some of which are effective retroactively. Tripadvisor anticipates that it will benefit from certain of these provisions and has accordingly recorded income tax benefits of $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, certain other governments have passed legislation to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through loans, wage subsidies, tax relief or other financial aid. Some of these governments have extended or are considering extending these programs. Tripadvisor has participated in several of these programs, including the CARES Act in the U.S., the United Kingdom's job retention scheme, as well as other certain jurisdictions' programs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recognized government grants and other assistance benefits of $12 million as a reduction of personnel and overhead costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook, TripCo recorded a trademark impairment of $250 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying fair value of the trademark approximates its estimated fair value. Further declines in Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook could result in a decrease in the fair value of the trademark. TripCo will continue to monitor events and circumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying value of Tripadvisor's trademark.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, which led to a decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, TripCo recorded a goodwill impairment of $279 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying value of the Hotels, Media and Platform reporting unit approximates its estimated fair value. Declines in the future revenue outlook, cash flows, or other changes in the business, may necessitate future impairments, which could be material. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial\nII-5\nperformance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nTripadvisor's stock price declined in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayment of TripCo's Margin Loan (as defined in note 7 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares LTRIP LLC ( Certares\u201d), with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) (see note 10 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements).\nHotels, Media & Platform Segment\nIn Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment its strategic objective is to preserve profit and drive increased customer engagement and monetization on the Tripadvisor platform. Tripadvisor seeks to achieve this by delivering consumers compelling products and holistic user experience as well as by offering travel partners a diverse set of advertising opportunities.\nFor consumers, Tripadvisor tests and implements product enhancements that deliver a more engaging and comprehensive hotel shopping experience. This includes providing rich, immersive content - reviews, photos, videos and ratings, among other contributions - as well as increasing the number of travel partners and properties as well as the available hotel supply on its platform. Tripadvisor believes providing consumers tools to discover, research, price shop and book a comprehensive selection of accommodations, helps increase brand awareness and brand loyalty and, over time, can result in deeper consumer engagement, more qualified leads delivered to travel partners and greater monetization on its platform.\nTripadvisor seeks to monetize its influence through hotel-related product improvements, supply and marketing efforts and customer advertising opportunities. Historically, Tripadvisor has generated a significant amount of hotel shoppers from search engines, such as Google. A hotel shopper is a visitor to Tripadvisor's sites that views either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. Tripadvisor's key ongoing objective related to traffic acquisition is to attract or acquire hotel shoppers at or above its desired marketing return on investment targets. Over the long-term, Tripadvisor is focused on driving a greater percentage of its traffic from direct traffic sources, which comes with little to no traffic acquisition costs.\nTripadvisor's business, including the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, has been adversely and materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was the primary and material driver of this segment's unfavorable results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as noted in the COVID-19 discussion above. During the third quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment demonstrated modest month-over-month performance improvements; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend, particularly in its European business. In addition, most notably in the pre-COVID time period, Tripadvisor experienced revenue headwinds in its SEO marketing channel, which it believes has been impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor expects this trend may continue.\nIn Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, Tripadvisor enables travel partners to amplify their brand, generate brand impressions, and potentially drive qualified leads and bookings for their businesses. Historically, Tripadvisor has limited both the type and number of display-based advertising opportunities it makes available to travel partners, particularly on mobile phone, which, in turn, has limited display-based advertising revenue growth. However, Tripadvisor is continuing to work on initiatives to better leverage its audience, content, data, travel influence and platform breadth to open up new media advertising opportunities through a more modern, high-powered advertising suite spanning native, video and programmatic solutions. Tripadvisor intends to broaden its solution to a larger set of advertising travel endemic and non-travel endemic advertising partners, including industries such as airlines and finance.\nIn addition, Tripadvisor has historically and will continue to focus on initiatives to increase its traffic quality and deepen customer engagement on its platform, including driving membership growth, increasing personalization, and innovating its mobile app experience. Tripadvisor believes improving the user experience on its platform will lead to\nII-6\nhigher monetization over time. Further, Tripadvisor believes there remains an opportunity to continue to grow its member base, as well as to deepen member engagement by making membership more valued, building communities and leveraging its content to further personalize trip-planning features. As an example, during December 2020, Tripadvisor introduced direct-to-consumer initiatives, which included a beta-launch of an annual subscription-based membership that offers discounts to consumers for hotels and experiences, and also a travel concierge service that connects travelers with a curated community of expert trip designers in local travel destinations.\nExperiences & Dining Segment\nTripadvisor's Experiences & Dining offerings contribute to the comprehensive user experience it delivers, which Tripadvisor believes helps to increase awareness of, loyalty to, and engagement with its products, drive more bookings to Experiences & Dining partners and generate greater revenue and increased profitability on its platform. Given the significant market opportunities in these large categories, Tripadvisor expects to continue to invest in building these offerings to drive consumer engagement, bookings and revenue growth for the long-term.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor's Experiences & Dining segment's financial results were adversely and materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants across European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit, primarily based in Europe, had largely regained the revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, imposed new restrictions to try to mitigate the resurgence of the virus, which negatively and materially impacted this recent trend. Throughout the pandemic, Tripadvisor has explored new initiatives to delight and engage consumers. For example, Tripadvisor began offering virtual tours to its consumers and beta-launched an annual subscription-based membership, as discussed above, which offers consumers discounts on experience bookings.\nIn December 2019, TripAdvisor acquired U.K.-based Bookatable, which offers an online restaurant reservation and booking platform. This further strengthened Tripadvisor's position in certain of its existing European markets as well as expands Tripadvisor into new countries for its Dining offering, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Finland and Norway. TheFork's online restaurant booking platform, including Bookatable, had approximately 76,000 total bookable restaurants as of December 31, 2020.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate and other is a combination of the Rentals, Flights & Car, and Cruise businesses. Profits and revenue have declined during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to Tripadvisor's other business units, and to a lesser extent, due to the sale of its SmarterTravel business in the second quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor operates these businesses opportunistically as they complement its overall strategic objectives to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners.\nII-7\nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nGeneral.

Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform revenue decreased by $578 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment has two revenue sources, as described below: (1) Tripadvisor-branded hotels, which includes Hotel auction and B2B revenue; and (2) Tripadvisor-branded display and platform. The decreases in Hotels, Media & Platform revenue are detailed as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor-branded hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor-branded display and platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Hotels, Media & Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nII-8\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue primarily includes hotel auction revenue, and to a lesser extent, hotel B2B revenue, which includes click-based revenue generated from hotel sponsored placement advertising that enable hotels to enhance their visibility on Tripadvisor hotel pages, and subscription-based advertising services that Tripadvisor offers to travel partners. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $487 million or 63% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with widespread travel restrictions and service limitations on our travel partners imposed by local and federal governments at various stages during the course of the year in response to the pandemic.\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $69 million or 8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease was due to factors impacting Tripadvisor's hotel metasearch auction revenue, primarily reduced revenue generated through its SEO marketing channel, which Tripadvisor believes is impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue was also impacted by its progressive optimizations in search engine marketing, or SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition spend, and to a lesser extent, the general trend of an increasing percentage of hotel shoppers visiting via mobile phones which monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Declines in Tripadvisor-branded hotels was partially offset, to a lesser extent, by growth in hotel sponsored placements revenue.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 19%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, which consists of revenue from display-based advertising across all its websites. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue decreased $91 million or 57% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in marketing spend from Tripadvisor's advertisers due to lack of consumer demand resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue increased $7 million or 5% during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in pricing, and to a lesser extent, new initiatives launched in the later part of 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Tripadvisor's Experiences & Dining segment revenue accounted for 31%, 29% and 23%, respectively, of total consolidated revenue. Experiences & Dining segment revenue decreased by $270 million or 59% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue growth in this segment was negatively impacted by a significant reduction in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with many jurisdictions globally adopting laws, rules, regulations or decrees intended to address COVID-19, including implementing various travel restrictions, shelter in place\u201d or social distancing\u201d mandates, or restricting access to city centers or popular tourist destinations, restaurants and limiting access to experience offerings in surrounding areas at various stages during the course of the year. Restaurants across many European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit had largely regained its revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to try to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend. The negative impact of COVID-19 to this segment's revenue was partially offset by incremental revenue of approximately $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, related to Tripadvisor's December 2019 acquisitions of Bookatable and SinglePlatform. Experiences & Dining segment revenue increased by $84 million or 23% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by growth in both Experiences & Dining bookings, including increased bookings and revenue from Tripadvisor websites, partially offset by adverse changes in foreign currency, which Tripadvisor estimates negatively impacted Experiences & Dining revenue by 4%.\nCorporate and other revenue, which includes Rentals revenue, in addition to primarily click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue from Flights, Cars, and Cruises offerings on Tripadvisor websites, decreased by $108 million or 65% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreased consumer demand, similar to Tripadvisor's other businesses, as a result of COVID-19, and subsequent widespread global travel restrictions and service limitations on travel partners imposed by local and federal\nII-9\ngovernments at various stages during the course of the year, and reduced travel partner spend in response to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020.\nOperating Expense. Operating expense declined $101 million and increased $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant drivers of operating expense are technology and content costs, which decreased by $62 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due personnel and overhead costs across Tripadvisor's business as a result of a reduction in headcount driven by cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as reductions in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments. Technology and content costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth, partially offset by a decrease of personnel and overhead costs in Corporate and other as a result of strategic personnel re-allocation across the business.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense declined $364 million and $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant driver of selling, general and administrative expense is selling and marketing expenses. These include direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate marketing commissions, social media costs, brand advertising (including television and other offline advertising), promotions and public relations. In addition, indirect sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $349 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs across all segments and businesses and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in television advertising costs in the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, driven by cost reduction measures primarily in response to the financial impact to Tripadvisor and decline in consumer demand caused by COVID-19. In addition, personnel and overhead costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of a reduction in headcount related to Tripadvisor's cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as a reduction in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $108 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an overall decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, as well as lower television advertising costs, driven by the Hotels, Media & Platform segment and Corporate and other. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in similar marketing expenditures in the Experiences & Dining segment and increased personnel and overhead costs related to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth.\nStock-based compensation. Stock based compensation decreased $19 million and increased $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in 2020 was due to workforce reductions and the reduction of targeted employee benefits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a modification that accelerated the vesting schedule of certain awards (see note 12 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in 2019 was due to the continued grants of stock options.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets from business acquisitions in previous years, partially offset by increased depreciation related to capitalized software and website development costs.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to incremental amortization for the right-of-use asset related to Tripadvisor's\nII-10\nheadquarters lease in Needham, Massachusetts (Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease\u201d) recorded upon adoption of ASC 842 and to a lesser extent increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs.\nRestructuring and other related reorganization costs. Tripadvisor incurred pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs consist of employee severance and related benefits. In response to COVID-19, and during the second quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor committed to restructuring actions intended to reinforce its financial position, reduce its cost structure, and improve operational efficiencies, resulting in headcount reductions, for which it recognized $32 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs. In addition, Tripadvisor engaged in a smaller scale restructuring action in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce its cost structure and improve its operational efficiencies, which resulted in headcount reductions for which Tripadvisor recognized $9 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs.\nImpairment of intangible assets. Due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million for trademarks and $297 million for goodwill were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recorded a $3 million impairment of goodwill related to its China business unit. Due to deteriorations in revenue, impairment losses of $288 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to trademarks. The trademarks were related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit.\nOperating Income (Loss). Our consolidated operating income (loss) declined $773 million and $287 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Operating income was impacted by the above explanations.\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our business and make decisions about our resources. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (932)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (159)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related reorganization costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (61)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nII-11\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotels, Media & Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Experiences & Dining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated TripCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (61)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $491 million and increased $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA decreased $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue, partially offset by reductions in television advertising costs, direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA increased $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to reduced direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition channels, and television advertising, which more than offset the decrease in revenue.\nExperiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $84 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decrease in revenue noted above, partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to reduced consumer demand and lack of, or reduced, availability of dine-in restaurants, experiences and tours, at various stages during the course of the year as a result of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, decreased direct costs related to credit card payments and other transaction costs directly related to reduced revenue, and a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Experiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to increased people costs to drive product and supply investments, as well as increased marketing investments to fund long-term growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in revenue, as noted above.\nCorporate and other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $42 million and increased $8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, when compared to the same periods in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to reduced costs related to marketing and operational re-alignments, primarily offset by a decrease in revenue, as described above. Corporate and other Adjusted OIBDA also includes $9 million, $8 million and $5 million of TripCo level selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nII-12\nOther Income and Expense\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (35)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated TripCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (41)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated TripCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (19)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated TripCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (22)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Interest expense. Interest expense increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of Tripadvisor's Senior Notes in July 2020 and higher average outstanding borrowings from its 2015 Credit Facility during 2020, partially offset by the repayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the first quarter of 2020. Interest expense decreased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower finance costs related to Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease under ASC 842 and no outstanding borrowings on Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility. These decreases at Tripadvisor were partially offset by increased corporate interest expense due to higher outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan agreement entered into by TripCo's bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable prepaid forward (as described in notes 5 and 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable postpaid forward. TripCo unwound the variable postpaid forward during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOther, net. The primary components of other, net are income and interest earned on money market funds and marketable securities offset by net foreign exchange losses. Other, net income decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the loss on the sale of certain Tripadvisor businesses, less interest income at Tripadvisor compared to the prior year, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt due to the mandatory prepayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the three months ended March 31, 2020, partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange compared to losses in the prior year. Other, net income increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned from Tripadvisor's money market funds and other investments due to increased average interest rates and increased average invested funds during 2019.\nIncome taxes. The Company had income tax benefits of $152 million, income tax benefits of $16 million, and income tax expenses of $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the impairment of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.\nII-13\nDuring 2019, the Company recognized additional tax expense for changes in unrecognized tax benefits and dividends from Tripadvisor not recognized for book purposes, net of a dividends received deduction. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% United States ( U.S.\u201d) federal tax rate and federal income tax credits.\nDuring 2018, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% U.S. federal tax rate.\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders. We had net losses attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders of $238 million, $22 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in net earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders were the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand in global financial institutions, money market funds and marketable securities, with maturities of 90 days or less at the date purchased.\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, monetization of our investments, outstanding or anticipated debt facilities, debt and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts.\nAs of December 31, 2020, TripCo had a cash balance of $423 million. Approximately $418 million of the cash balance is held at Tripadvisor. Although TripCo has a 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor, Tripadvisor is a separate public company with a significant non-controlling interest, as TripCo has only a 23% economic interest in Tripadvisor. Even though TripCo controls Tripadvisor through its voting interest and board representation, decision making with respect to using Tripadvisor's cash balances must consider Tripadvisor's minority holders. Accordingly, any potential distributions of cash from Tripadvisor to TripCo would generally be on a pro rata basis based on economic ownership interests. Covenants in Tripadvisor's debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. See note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $91 million of TripCo cash and cash equivalents is held by Tripadvisor foreign subsidiaries, of which approximately 30% was located in the U.K., with the majority of Tripadvisor's international cash denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and, to a lesser extent, British pounds, Australian dollars and other currencies. As of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor had $494 million of cumulative undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), foreign earnings may now generally be repatriated back to the U.S. without incurring U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31, 2020, $376 million of Tripadvisor's cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. See note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor was party to a credit agreement with a group of lenders, initially entered in June 2015 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), which, among other things, provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of May 12, 2024.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility requires Tripadvisor to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility generally bear interest, at Tripadvisor's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Borrowing rate, or the adjusted LIBO rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing; plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% ( Eurocurrency Spread\u201d), based on the Company's leverage ratio; or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) Borrowing, which is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or LIBO rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve\nII-14\nRate) for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%; in addition to an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% ( ABR Spread\u201d), based on the Tripadvisor's leverage ratio.\nHowever, in May 2020, Tripadvisor amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor, and add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance with the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor also downsized the facility's borrowing capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. These amendments also limit Tripadvisor from making certain payments and distributions, including share repurchases and dividends during the Leverage Covenant Holiday. During the Leverage Covenant Holiday, any future borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a 2.25% margin with a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum. Tripadvisor is also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, at an applicable rate of 0.5%, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter during the Leverage Covenant Holiday.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Tripadvisor was in compliance with its covenants under the 2015 Credit Facility. While there can be no assurance that Tripadvisor will be able to meet the leverage ratio covenant after the Leverage Covenant Holiday expires, based on current projections, Tripadvisor does not believe there is a material risk it will not remain in compliance throughout the next twelve months.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility. These funds were drawn down as a precautionary measure to reinforce Tripadvisor's liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings in full during the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nIn July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million in Senior Notes. The Senior Notes provide, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, at an interest rate of 7.000% per annum, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. In July 2020, Tripadvisor used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, or $490 million, net of approximately $10 million in deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Tripadvisor and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are not a registered security and there are no plans to register Tripadvisor's Senior Notes as a security in the future. As a result, Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC is not applicable and no separate financial statements are required for the guarantor subsidiaries.\nOn November 1, 2019, Tripadvisor's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.50 per share, or approximately $488 million in the aggregate. The dividend was payable on December 4, 2019 to stockholders of record on November 20, 2019. TripCo received approximately $108 million based on our ownership in Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor funded this special cash dividend with available cash primarily from the U.S. and to a lesser extent from a foreign subsidiary, with no material related income tax impacts.\nHistorically, Tripadvisor's operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and long term debt obligations and other financial commitments and are expected to be sufficient in future periods.\nII-15\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow information\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (194)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (215)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (56)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (56)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tripadvisor cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (580)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (358)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (358)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, TripCo's primary uses of cash were repayments of debt of $1,052 million, which includes repayment of the principal amount of the Margin Loan of $352 million, repurchases of Tripadvisor common stock of $115 million, capital expenditures of $55 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $21 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with borrowings of debt of $1,240 million and the issuance of redeemable preferred stock of $325 million (see note 7 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, TripCo's primary uses of cash were dividends paid by Tripadvisor to noncontrolling interests of $380 million, debt repayments of $359 million, including $259 million in principal payments on the VPF and $100 million in principal payments on the original margin loans, purchases of marketable securities of $133 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $108 million, capital expenditures of $83 million, share repurchases of $60 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $29 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, borrowings of debt of $235 million, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $150 million and derivative proceeds from counterparties of $71 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, TripCo's primary use of cash was net debt repayments of $238 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with available cash, cash provided by operations and approximately $64 million in sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities and borrowings of debt.\nThe projected use of TripCo's corporate cash will primarily be to pay fees (not expected to exceed $4 million annually) to Liberty Media for providing certain services pursuant to the services agreement and the facilities sharing agreement, payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (unless added to the liquidation preference or paid in shares of Series A common stock of TripCo), and to pay any other corporate level expenses.\nTripadvisor believes that its available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund Tripadvisor's foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt obligations, lease commitments and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Tripadvisor's future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, and/or other expenditures in support of its business strategy, and may potentially reduce Tripadvisor's cash balance and/or increase its borrowings under its 2015 Credit Facility or other borrowings. In addition, Tripadvisor's capital requirements may increase due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has already resulted in reduced revenue and operating cash flows for Tripadvisor, and the extent and duration to which it may continue to impact Tripadvisor's business is unclear. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to its liquidity and capital requirements, and therefore its capital structure.\nII-16\nOn February 18, 2021 the Company entered into a $25 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility matures on the earliest of (i) February 18, 2024, (ii) if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), the earlier of (a) the date that is 120 days from the date the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights or (b) the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed and (iii) 15 days following the consummation of certain change of control transactions. The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%. The Credit Facility will be drawn on primarily to cover corporate general and administrative expenses.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor's stock price fell sharply in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayments of TripCo's Margin Loan. In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares, with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created Series A Preferred Stock. As discussed in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, following March 26, 2021, Certares will have certain put rights to require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price for, at our election, cash, shares of Tripadvisor common stock, shares of our Series A or Series C common stock, provided that shares of our Series A or Series Common stock, as the case may be, are listed on a national securities exchange and are actively traded, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to certain limitations. Certares may exercise its put right by delivering notice to us within a certain number of days following our filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, and we will have 180 days from the delivery of such notice to redeem the outstanding Preferred Stock. If we determine not to redeem the Preferred Stock within that 180-day period, we may facilitate the sale of Certares' Preferred Stock and, if necessary, make Certares whole for any shortfall from the redemption price.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe have contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business including potential tax obligations associated with certain transactions following the formation of TripCo. Although it is reasonably possible we may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations, excluding uncertain tax positions as it is undeterminable when payments will be made, is summarized below.\nII-17\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected interest payments on Senior Notes (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Preferred Stock (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Estimated future lease payments for Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease in Needham, Massachusetts and operating leases, primarily for office space, with non-cancelable lease terms.

Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported.\nRecognition and Recoverability of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill.\nOur non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events and the initial recognition of such assets through the application of the purchase accounting method. If the carrying value of our definite lived intangible assets and long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets,\nII-18\npresent value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the composition of our reportable segments was revised. As a result of the change in reporting units, we assessed the recoverability of our goodwill and concluded the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying values for these reporting units. Therefore, no indications of impairment were identified as a result of these changes in the first quarter of 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reportable segments was as follows:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trademarks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotels, Media & Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Experiences & Dining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If, based on the qualitative analysis, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million of trademarks and $279 million of goodwill were recorded, respectively, related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit. The fair value of the trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of market multiples (market approach) and discounted cash flow (income approach) calculations (Level 3).\nBased on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter of 2020 and the resulting impairment losses recorded, the estimated fair values of the trademark and Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit approximate their respective carrying values. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 environment and our inability to predict the expected duration and ultimate severity of the impact of COVID-19, the Company believes its reporting units and trademark are at an elevated risk of impairment in future periods. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial performance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test for our trademarks. The fair value of our indefinite-lived trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. Due to deteriorating revenue, an impairment loss of $288 million was\nII-19\nrecorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to trademarks, related to the hotels, media & platform reporting unit.\nFollowing the trademark impairment, also during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed qualitative assessments for our reporting units and performed quantitative assessments for our Rentals and China reporting units and concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nAdditionally, Tripadvisor records liabilities to address uncertain tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or that are expected to be taken in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which a conclusion is reached that it is more likely than not it will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority is recognized. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nII-20", "item_7_truncated": "However, in May 2020, Tripadvisor amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor, and add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance with the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor also downsized the facility's borrowing capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. These amendments also limit Tripadvisor from making certain payments and distributions, including share repurchases and dividends during the Leverage Covenant Holiday. During the Leverage Covenant Holiday, any future borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a 2.25% margin with a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum.

Restaurants across European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit, primarily based in Europe, had largely regained the revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, imposed new restrictions to try to mitigate the resurgence of the virus, which negatively and materially impacted this recent trend. Throughout the pandemic, Tripadvisor has explored new initiatives to delight and engage consumers. For example, Tripadvisor began offering virtual tours to its consumers and beta-launched an annual subscription-based membership, as discussed above, which offers consumers discounts on experience bookings.\nSee note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of new accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotels, Media & Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Experiences & Dining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated TripCo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (61)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n planned or annual subscription basis, both click-based and display-based media advertising, and experiences and restaurants; \nOverview\nII-6\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trademarks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotels, Media & Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Experiences & Dining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTripadvisor believes that its available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund Tripadvisor's foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt obligations, lease commitments and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Tripadvisor's future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, and/or other expenditures in support of its business strategy, and may potentially reduce Tripadvisor's cash balance and/or increase its borrowings under its 2015 Credit Facility or other borrowings. In addition, Tripadvisor's capital requirements may increase due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has already resulted in reduced revenue and operating cash flows for Tripadvisor, and the extent and duration to which it may continue to impact Tripadvisor's business is unclear. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to its liquidity and capital requirements, and therefore its capital structure.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

While there can be no assurance that Tripadvisor will be able to meet the leverage ratio covenant after the Leverage Covenant Holiday expires, based on current projections, Tripadvisor does not believe there is a material risk it will not remain in compliance throughout the next twelve months.\n\n Interest expense. Interest expense increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of Tripadvisor's Senior Notes in July 2020 and higher average outstanding borrowings from its 2015 Credit Facility during 2020, partially offset by the repayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the first quarter of 2020. Interest expense decreased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower finance costs related to Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease under ASC 842 and no outstanding borrowings on Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility. These decreases at Tripadvisor were partially offset by increased corporate interest expense due to higher outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan agreement entered into by TripCo's bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook, TripCo recorded a trademark impairment of $250 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying fair value of the trademark approximates its estimated fair value. Further declines in Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook could result in a decrease in the fair value of the trademark. TripCo will continue to monitor events and circumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying value of Tripadvisor's trademark.\nIn Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, Tripadvisor enables travel partners to amplify their brand, generate brand impressions, and potentially drive qualified leads and bookings for their businesses. Historically, Tripadvisor has limited both the type and number of display-based advertising opportunities it makes available to travel partners, particularly on mobile phone, which, in turn, has limited display-based advertising revenue growth. However, Tripadvisor is continuing to work on initiatives to better leverage its audience, content, data, travel influence and platform breadth to open up new media advertising opportunities through a more modern, high-powered advertising suite spanning native, video and programmatic solutions. Tripadvisor intends to broaden its solution to a larger set of advertising travel endemic and non-travel endemic advertising partners, including industries such as airlines and finance.\nRevenue. Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform revenue decreased by $578 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment has two revenue sources, as described below: (1) Tripadvisor-branded hotels, which includes Hotel auction and B2B revenue; and (2) Tripadvisor-branded display and platform. The decreases in Hotels, Media & Platform revenue are detailed as follows:\nThe online travel industry is large and highly dynamic and competitive. Tripadvisor's overall strategy is to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners in order to generate more monetization on its platform. While Tripadvisor operates with a long-term growth focus, its specific growth objectives and resource allocation strategies can differ in both duration and magnitude within its segments. Descriptions of these dynamics, as well as the current trends affecting its overall business and reportable segments, key drivers of financial results, and uncertainties that may impact Tripadvisor's ability to execute on its objectives and strategies, are below.\nII-7\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe financial information represents the historical consolidated results of TripCo and its subsidiaries as discussed in note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the following discussion, TripCo and its subsidiaries are referred to as TripCo,\u201d the Company,\u201d us,\u201d we\u201d and our\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our business and make decisions about our resources. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\nII-12\nOther, net. The primary components of other, net are income and interest earned on money market funds and marketable securities offset by net foreign exchange losses. Other, net income decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the loss on the sale of certain Tripadvisor businesses, less interest income at Tripadvisor compared to the prior year, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt due to the mandatory prepayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the three months ended March 31, 2020, partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange compared to losses in the prior year. Other, net income increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned from Tripadvisor's money market funds and other investments due to increased average interest rates and increased average invested funds during 2019.\n \u25cf opportunistically pursuing strategic acquisitions. \nWe have contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business including potential tax obligations associated with certain transactions following the formation of TripCo. Although it is reasonably possible we may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nII-2\nIn addition, Tripadvisor has historically and will continue to focus on initiatives to increase its traffic quality and deepen customer engagement on its platform, including driving membership growth, increasing personalization, and innovating its mobile app experience. Tripadvisor believes improving the user experience on its platform will lead to\nCurrent Trends Affecting Tripadvisor's Business\nII-5\nIn December 2019, TripAdvisor acquired U.K.-based Bookatable, which offers an online restaurant reservation and booking platform. This further strengthened Tripadvisor's position in certain of its existing European markets as well as expands Tripadvisor into new countries for its Dining offering, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Finland and Norway. TheFork's online restaurant booking platform, including Bookatable, had approximately 76,000 total bookable restaurants as of December 31, 2020.\nTripadvisor seeks to monetize its influence through hotel-related product improvements, supply and marketing efforts and customer advertising opportunities. Historically, Tripadvisor has generated a significant amount of hotel shoppers from search engines, such as Google. A hotel shopper is a visitor to Tripadvisor's sites that views either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. Tripadvisor's key ongoing objective related to traffic acquisition is to attract or acquire hotel shoppers at or above its desired marketing return on investment targets. Over the long-term, Tripadvisor is focused on driving a greater percentage of its traffic from direct traffic sources, which comes with little to no traffic acquisition costs.\nOperating Expense. Operating expense declined $101 million and increased $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant drivers of operating expense are technology and content costs, which decreased by $62 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due personnel and overhead costs across Tripadvisor's business as a result of a reduction in headcount driven by cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as reductions in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments. Technology and content costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth, partially offset by a decrease of personnel and overhead costs in Corporate and other as a result of strategic personnel re-allocation across the business.\n (4) This amount represents the redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock at December 31, 2020 and assumes that the Series A Preferred Stock will not be redeemed prior to the mandatory redemption date on March 26, 2025. \n \u25cf Making targeted reductions of Tripadvisor's office lease portfolio, primarily either through subleasing or allowing property leases to expire.  By the end of the third quarter of 2020, a majority of Tripadvisor's previously furloughed employees had returned to their jobs. However, during the fourth quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor again furloughed approximately 400 employees, primarily in its European operations of TheFork. This action taken by Tripadvisor was a direct result of the reinstatement of government restrictions related to restaurants in various countries within Europe, in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in those markets.\nII-8\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industry and consequently adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2020. Among other impacts, COVID-19 has negatively impacted global consumer demand and consumers' ability to travel, thereby resulting in many of Tripadvisor's travel partners operating at significantly reduced service levels.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense declined $364 million and $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant driver of selling, general and administrative expense is selling and marketing expenses. These include direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate marketing commissions, social media costs, brand advertising (including television and other offline advertising), promotions and public relations. In addition, indirect sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.\nCorporate and other\nFollowing the trademark impairment, also during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed qualitative assessments for our reporting units and performed quantitative assessments for our Rentals and China reporting units and concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed.\nHistorically, Tripadvisor's operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and long term debt obligations and other financial commitments and are expected to be sufficient in future periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Tripadvisor's Experiences & Dining segment revenue accounted for 31%, 29% and 23%, respectively, of total consolidated revenue. Experiences & Dining segment revenue decreased by $270 million or 59% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue growth in this segment was negatively impacted by a significant reduction in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with many jurisdictions globally adopting laws, rules, regulations or decrees intended to address COVID-19, including implementing various travel restrictions, shelter in place\u201d or social distancing\u201d mandates, or restricting access to city centers or popular tourist destinations, restaurants and limiting access to experience offerings in surrounding areas at various stages during the course of the year. Restaurants across many European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit had largely regained its revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to try to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend. The negative impact of COVID-19 to this segment's revenue was partially offset by incremental revenue of approximately $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, related to Tripadvisor's December 2019 acquisitions of Bookatable and SinglePlatform. Experiences & Dining segment revenue increased by $84 million or 23% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by growth in both Experiences & Dining bookings, including increased bookings and revenue from Tripadvisor websites, partially offset by adverse changes in foreign currency, which Tripadvisor estimates negatively impacted Experiences & Dining revenue by 4%.\nFor consumers, Tripadvisor tests and implements product enhancements that deliver a more engaging and comprehensive hotel shopping experience. This includes providing rich, immersive content - reviews, photos, videos and ratings, among other contributions - as well as increasing the number of travel partners and properties as well as the available hotel supply on its platform. Tripadvisor believes providing consumers tools to discover, research, price shop and book a comprehensive selection of accommodations, helps increase brand awareness and brand loyalty and, over time, can result in deeper consumer engagement, more qualified leads delivered to travel partners and greater monetization on its platform.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility (as defined below) as a precautionary measure to reinforce its liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings during the third quarter of 2020. In May 2020, Tripadvisor amended its 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor (such period, the Leverage Covenant Holiday\u201d), add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility, to among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance under the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor (the Covenant Changeover Date\u201d), at which time the leverage ratio covenant will be reinstated. At this time, Tripadvisor also downsized the capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. Tripadvisor believes this additional flexibility will be important given its continued limited ability to predict its future financial performance due to the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, as well as consumer behavior, and restrictive measures put in place in response to COVID-19.\nIn addition, certain other governments have passed legislation to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through loans, wage subsidies, tax relief or other financial aid. Some of these governments have extended or are considering extending these programs. Tripadvisor has participated in several of these programs, including the CARES Act in the U.S., the United Kingdom's job retention scheme, as well as other certain jurisdictions' programs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recognized government grants and other assistance benefits of $12 million as a reduction of personnel and overhead costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nII-3\nOn February 18, 2021 the Company entered into a $25 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility matures on the earliest of (i) February 18, 2024, (ii) if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), the earlier of (a) the date that is 120 days from the date the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights or (b) the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed and (iii) 15 days following the consummation of certain change of control transactions. The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%. The Credit Facility will be drawn on primarily to cover corporate general and administrative expenses.\nRate) for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%; in addition to an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% ( ABR Spread\u201d), based on the Tripadvisor's leverage ratio.\nExperiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $84 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decrease in revenue noted above, partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to reduced consumer demand and lack of, or reduced, availability of dine-in restaurants, experiences and tours, at various stages during the course of the year as a result of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, decreased direct costs related to credit card payments and other transaction costs directly related to reduced revenue, and a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Experiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to increased people costs to drive product and supply investments, as well as increased marketing investments to fund long-term growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in revenue, as noted above.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes corporate expenses.\nExperiences & Dining Segment\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\nIn March 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes numerous income tax provisions, some of which are effective retroactively. Tripadvisor anticipates that it will benefit from certain of these provisions and has accordingly recorded income tax benefits of $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCorporate and other is a combination of the Rentals, Flights & Car, and Cruise businesses. Profits and revenue have declined during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to Tripadvisor's other business units, and to a lesser extent, due to the sale of its SmarterTravel business in the second quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor operates these businesses opportunistically as they complement its overall strategic objectives to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners.\nIn addition, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on travel, regional and global markets, and overall economic activity remains difficult to predict. Therefore, the ultimate extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remains largely uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued resurgence and severity of the virus, continued transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the timing or extent of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine, mobility and travel restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on consumer travel behavior.\nII-15\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million of trademarks and $279 million of goodwill were recorded, respectively, related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit. The fair value of the trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of market multiples (market approach) and discounted cash flow (income approach) calculations (Level 3).\nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nAs of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand in global financial institutions, money market funds and marketable securities, with maturities of 90 days or less at the date purchased.\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill.\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\nTripadvisor has worked with travelers and travel partners to address cancellations, re-bookings, and in certain cases it has provided its travel partners extended payment terms, discounts and other incentives.\n\nTripadvisor's stock price declined in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayment of TripCo's Margin Loan (as defined in note 7 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares LTRIP LLC ( Certares\u201d), with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) (see note 10 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the impairment of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to incremental amortization for the right-of-use asset related to Tripadvisor's\nGeneral. We provide in the tables below information regarding our historical Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments.\nRecognition and Recoverability of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If, based on the qualitative analysis, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nWe are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nII-14\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported.\n\n (3) Expected interest payments on Tripadvisor's Senior Notes are based on a fixed interest rate of 7.0% as of December 31, 2020. \nhigher monetization over time. Further, Tripadvisor believes there remains an opportunity to continue to grow its member base, as well as to deepen member engagement by making membership more valued, building communities and leveraging its content to further personalize trip-planning features. As an example, during December 2020, Tripadvisor introduced direct-to-consumer initiatives, which included a beta-launch of an annual subscription-based membership that offers discounts to consumers for hotels and experiences, and also a travel concierge service that connects travelers with a curated community of expert trip designers in local travel destinations.\n Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $491 million and increased $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA decreased $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue, partially offset by reductions in television advertising costs, direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA increased $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to reduced direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition channels, and television advertising, which more than offset the decrease in revenue.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor's stock price fell sharply in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayments of TripCo's Margin Loan. In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares, with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created Series A Preferred Stock. As discussed in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, following March 26, 2021, Certares will have certain put rights to require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price for, at our election, cash, shares of Tripadvisor common stock, shares of our Series A or Series C common stock, provided that shares of our Series A or Series Common stock, as the case may be, are listed on a national securities exchange and are actively traded, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to certain limitations. Certares may exercise its put right by delivering notice to us within a certain number of days following our filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, and we will have 180 days from the delivery of such notice to redeem the outstanding Preferred Stock. If we determine not to redeem the Preferred Stock within that 180-day period, we may facilitate the sale of Certares' Preferred Stock and, if necessary, make Certares whole for any shortfall from the redemption price.\n \u25cf Enacting a workforce reduction eliminating more than 900 employees; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, TripCo's primary use of cash was net debt repayments of $238 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with available cash, cash provided by operations and approximately $64 million in sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities and borrowings of debt.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $108 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an overall decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, as well as lower television advertising costs, driven by the Hotels, Media & Platform segment and Corporate and other. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in similar marketing expenditures in the Experiences & Dining segment and increased personnel and overhead costs related to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth.\nAdditionally, Tripadvisor records liabilities to address uncertain tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or that are expected to be taken in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which a conclusion is reached that it is more likely than not it will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority is recognized. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\n \u25cf driving operational efficiencies; and \n\nII-19\n (2) Amounts (i) are stated at the face amount at maturity of our debt instruments, (ii) do not assume additional borrowings or refinancings of existing debt and (iii) assume interest rates remain at the December 31, 2020 rates. \nStock-based compensation. Stock based compensation decreased $19 million and increased $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in 2020 was due to workforce reductions and the reduction of targeted employee benefits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a modification that accelerated the vesting schedule of certain awards (see note 12 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in 2019 was due to the continued grants of stock options.\nImpairment of intangible assets. Due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million for trademarks and $297 million for goodwill were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recorded a $3 million impairment of goodwill related to its China business unit. Due to deteriorations in revenue, impairment losses of $288 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to trademarks. The trademarks were related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit.\n \u25cf Furloughing additional employees bringing the total furloughed employees during March and April 2020 to approximately 850 employees, primarily in Tripadvisor's European operations at TheFork; and \nExecutive Summary\nTripadvisor has also incurred significant and unanticipated cancellations by travelers related to future travel, accommodations and tour bookings, which had been reserved by travelers in the pre-COVID-19 timeframe, and included a significant number of bookings recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. During the course of 2020,\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $69 million or 8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease was due to factors impacting Tripadvisor's hotel metasearch auction revenue, primarily reduced revenue generated through its SEO marketing channel, which Tripadvisor believes is impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue was also impacted by its progressive optimizations in search engine marketing, or SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition spend, and to a lesser extent, the general trend of an increasing percentage of hotel shoppers visiting via mobile phones which monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Declines in Tripadvisor-branded hotels was partially offset, to a lesser extent, by growth in hotel sponsored placements revenue.\nrecorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to trademarks, related to the hotels, media & platform reporting unit.\nIn July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million in Senior Notes. The Senior Notes provide, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, at an interest rate of 7.000% per annum, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. In July 2020, Tripadvisor used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, or $490 million, net of approximately $10 million in deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Tripadvisor and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are not a registered security and there are no plans to register Tripadvisor's Senior Notes as a security in the future. As a result, Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC is not applicable and no separate financial statements are required for the guarantor subsidiaries.\nOur non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events and the initial recognition of such assets through the application of the purchase accounting method. If the carrying value of our definite lived intangible assets and long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets,\nRestructuring and other related reorganization costs. Tripadvisor incurred pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs consist of employee severance and related benefits. In response to COVID-19, and during the second quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor committed to restructuring actions intended to reinforce its financial position, reduce its cost structure, and improve operational efficiencies, resulting in headcount reductions, for which it recognized $32 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs. In addition, Tripadvisor engaged in a smaller scale restructuring action in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce its cost structure and improve its operational efficiencies, which resulted in headcount reductions for which Tripadvisor recognized $9 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable prepaid forward (as described in notes 5 and 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable postpaid forward. TripCo unwound the variable postpaid forward during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, monetization of our investments, outstanding or anticipated debt facilities, debt and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts.\nII-10\n \u25cf deepening travel partner engagement on Tripadvisor's platform by expanding the number of products and services offered; \nOperating Income (Loss). Our consolidated operating income (loss) declined $773 million and $287 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Operating income was impacted by the above explanations.\nOther Income and Expense\nStrategies and Challenges\nII-9\nCorporate and other revenue, which includes Rentals revenue, in addition to primarily click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue from Flights, Cars, and Cruises offerings on Tripadvisor websites, decreased by $108 million or 65% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreased consumer demand, similar to Tripadvisor's other businesses, as a result of COVID-19, and subsequent widespread global travel restrictions and service limitations on travel partners imposed by local and federal\n (1) Estimated future lease payments for Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease in Needham, Massachusetts and operating leases, primarily for office space, with non-cancelable lease terms. See note 8 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the composition of our reportable segments was revised. As a result of the change in reporting units, we assessed the recoverability of our goodwill and concluded the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying values for these reporting units. Therefore, no indications of impairment were identified as a result of these changes in the first quarter of 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test for our trademarks. The fair value of our indefinite-lived trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. Due to deteriorating revenue, an impairment loss of $288 million was\nAs of December 31, 2020, TripCo had a cash balance of $423 million. Approximately $418 million of the cash balance is held at Tripadvisor. Although TripCo has a 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor, Tripadvisor is a separate public company with a significant non-controlling interest, as TripCo has only a 23% economic interest in Tripadvisor. Even though TripCo controls Tripadvisor through its voting interest and board representation, decision making with respect to using Tripadvisor's cash balances must consider Tripadvisor's minority holders. Accordingly, any potential distributions of cash from Tripadvisor to TripCo would generally be on a pro rata basis based on economic ownership interests. Covenants in Tripadvisor's debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. See note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn response to the impact of COVID-19, Tripadvisor has taken several steps to further strengthen its financial position and balance sheet, and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility during 2020, including, but not limited to, restructuring activities, reducing its ongoing operating expenses and headcount, additional borrowings of debt, and amendments to Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility, all of which are described in more detail below.\nAs part of Tripadvisor's long-term growth strategy, it favors continuous product innovation in order to deliver customers more value. In this regard, Tripadvisor beta-launched a direct-to-consumer annual subscription-based offering in December 2020.\nTripadvisor's Experiences & Dining offerings contribute to the comprehensive user experience it delivers, which Tripadvisor believes helps to increase awareness of, loyalty to, and engagement with its products, drive more bookings to Experiences & Dining partners and generate greater revenue and increased profitability on its platform. Given the significant market opportunities in these large categories, Tripadvisor expects to continue to invest in building these offerings to drive consumer engagement, bookings and revenue growth for the long-term.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility. These funds were drawn down as a precautionary measure to reinforce Tripadvisor's liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings in full during the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nHotels, Media & Platform Segment\nCorporate and other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $42 million and increased $8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, when compared to the same periods in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to reduced costs related to marketing and operational re-alignments, primarily offset by a decrease in revenue, as described above. Corporate and other Adjusted OIBDA also includes $9 million, $8 million and $5 million of TripCo level selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $349 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs across all segments and businesses and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in television advertising costs in the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, driven by cost reduction measures primarily in response to the financial impact to Tripadvisor and decline in consumer demand caused by COVID-19. In addition, personnel and overhead costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of a reduction in headcount related to Tripadvisor's cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as a reduction in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments.\nWhile we have seen varying degrees of containment of the virus in certain countries and some signs of travel recovery during points in time during 2020, the degree of containment and the recovery in travel has varied region-to-region globally, as well as state-to-state in the U.S. Most notably, a resurgence of COVID-19 has occurred again, after a period of decline, during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, followed by the reinstatement of government restrictions and mandates in certain geographies globally and the identification of new variants of the virus. There remains uncertainty around when remaining or reinstated restrictions will be lifted, where additional restrictions may be initiated, or where restrictions that have been previously lifted may be reinstated due to resurgence of the virus, nor is it clear when the short or long-term changes to consumer usage patterns on its platform or travel behavior patterns when travel bans and other government restrictions and mandates are fully lifted, or the timing of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine globally. Tripadvisor believes the travel industry and its business will continue to be materially and adversely affected while such travel restrictions remain in place and COVID-19 continues to proliferate. Although Tripadvisor cannot predict with certainty the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its full year 2021 financial results, it currently expects that its first quarter 2021 financial results will continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic to a material degree.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility requires Tripadvisor to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility generally bear interest, at Tripadvisor's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Borrowing rate, or the adjusted LIBO rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing; plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% ( Eurocurrency Spread\u201d), based on the Company's leverage ratio; or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) Borrowing, which is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or LIBO rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve\nTripadvisor's business, including the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, has been adversely and materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was the primary and material driver of this segment's unfavorable results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as noted in the COVID-19 discussion above. During the third quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment demonstrated modest month-over-month performance improvements; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend, particularly in its European business. In addition, most notably in the pre-COVID time period, Tripadvisor experienced revenue headwinds in its SEO marketing channel, which it believes has been impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor expects this trend may continue.\nCommencing in late February 2020 and progressively worsening through March 2020, Tripadvisor experienced a significant decline in user demand for its products and services, concurrent with intensifying concerns about COVID-19 on a global basis, in conjunction with widespread travel restrictions imposed by governments and businesses. The adverse impact to Tripadvisor's business from COVID-19 intensified in the second half of March, driven by the pandemic's proliferation and increased governmental restrictions and mandates globally that additionally impacted the travel, hospitality, restaurant and leisure industry and further dampened consumer demand for Tripadvisor's products and services. In the second half of March and throughout April, significant year-over-year revenue declines generally stabilized across Tripadvisor's segments and products which generally continued throughout the second quarter of 2020, and modestly improved during the third quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 40% of the prior year's comparable period. In the second half of 2020, Tripadvisor's revenue averaged approximately 35% of the prior year's comparable period, while revenue performance in the months of November and December was approximately 33% of the prior year's comparable periods. This trend compares favorably to the trends observed in months of April 2020 and May 2020, where Tripadvisor's revenue for those months was approximately 10% of the prior year's comparable periods. In addition, traffic trends on Tripadvisor's websites have improved since the significant declines seen in the second half of March and throughout April 2020. In the second half of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites averaged approximately 67% of the prior year's comparable periods, while in April and May of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites were approximately 33% and 45%, respectively, of the prior year's comparable periods, respectively. While Tripadvisor's revenue and traffic trends generally improved since April and May 2020, these trends began to flatten out in September 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted these recent trends, as monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites during the fourth quarter of 2020 declined to approximately 60% of the prior year's comparable period, in comparison to approximately 70% of the prior year's comparable period, during the third quarter of 2020.\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders. We had net losses attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders of $238 million, $22 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in net earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders were the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 19%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, which consists of revenue from display-based advertising across all its websites. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue decreased $91 million or 57% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in marketing spend from Tripadvisor's advertisers due to lack of consumer demand resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue increased $7 million or 5% during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in pricing, and to a lesser extent, new initiatives launched in the later part of 2019.\nII-20\nTripadvisor's long-term growth strategy aims to increase customer engagement on its platform and drive profitable growth through:\nIn Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment its strategic objective is to preserve profit and drive increased customer engagement and monetization on the Tripadvisor platform. Tripadvisor seeks to achieve this by delivering consumers compelling products and holistic user experience as well as by offering travel partners a diverse set of advertising opportunities.\n (5) Includes purchase obligations, expected commitment fee payments on the Tripadvisor 2015 Credit Facility (as defined in note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and long term income taxes payable. \nDuring 2019, the Company recognized additional tax expense for changes in unrecognized tax benefits and dividends from Tripadvisor not recognized for book purposes, net of a dividends received deduction. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% United States ( U.S.\u201d) federal tax rate and federal income tax credits.\nII-17\nDuring the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor instituted additional cost reduction measures, including the elimination of the majority of discretionary spending, business travel, non-critical vendor relationships, brand advertising, cessation of nearly all new hiring and contingent staff, reduction of targeted employee benefits, and the furloughing of over 100 employees. On April 28, 2020, management approved and Tripadvisor announced an additional cost reduction initiative in response to the continued economic and financial impacts to Tripadvisor as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included the following:\nThe projected use of TripCo's corporate cash will primarily be to pay fees (not expected to exceed $4 million annually) to Liberty Media for providing certain services pursuant to the services agreement and the facilities sharing agreement, payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (unless added to the liquidation preference or paid in shares of Series A common stock of TripCo), and to pay any other corporate level expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor incurred total pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of approximately $41 million as a result of these measures, all of which were paid by Tripadvisor as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor instituted a cost reduction initiative to preserve cash flows, including targeted workforce reduction measures largely in the Experiences & Dining segment and optimizing and reducing brand advertising as Tripadvisor pivots to leverage newer mediums it believes will be more effective than its historically television-focused campaign.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor was party to a credit agreement with a group of lenders, initially entered in June 2015 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), which, among other things, provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of May 12, 2024.\nOn November 1, 2019, Tripadvisor's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.50 per share, or approximately $488 million in the aggregate. The dividend was payable on December 4, 2019 to stockholders of record on November 20, 2019. TripCo received approximately $108 million based on our ownership in Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor funded this special cash dividend with available cash primarily from the U.S. and to a lesser extent from a foreign subsidiary, with no material related income tax impacts.\nII-4\ngovernments at various stages during the course of the year, and reduced travel partner spend in response to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, TripCo's primary uses of cash were repayments of debt of $1,052 million, which includes repayment of the principal amount of the Margin Loan of $352 million, repurchases of Tripadvisor common stock of $115 million, capital expenditures of $55 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $21 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with borrowings of debt of $1,240 million and the issuance of redeemable preferred stock of $325 million (see note 7 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue primarily includes hotel auction revenue, and to a lesser extent, hotel B2B revenue, which includes click-based revenue generated from hotel sponsored placement advertising that enable hotels to enhance their visibility on Tripadvisor hotel pages, and subscription-based advertising services that Tripadvisor offers to travel partners. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $487 million or 63% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with widespread travel restrictions and service limitations on our travel partners imposed by local and federal governments at various stages during the course of the year in response to the pandemic.\nII-11\n \u25cf building products that delight travelers by reducing friction throughout the travel planning and trip-taking journey; \nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $91 million of TripCo cash and cash equivalents is held by Tripadvisor foreign subsidiaries, of which approximately 30% was located in the U.K., with the majority of Tripadvisor's international cash denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and, to a lesser extent, British pounds, Australian dollars and other currencies. As of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor had $494 million of cumulative undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), foreign earnings may now generally be repatriated back to the U.S. without incurring U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31, 2020, $376 million of Tripadvisor's cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. See note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations, excluding uncertain tax positions as it is undeterminable when payments will be made, is summarized below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn addition, in July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private offering. The Indenture pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued provides, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes at 7.000% per annum, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. Tripadvisor used the net proceeds received of $490 million, net of deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its 2015 Credit Facility borrowings.\nResults for TripCo are largely dependent upon the operating performance of Tripadvisor. Therefore, the executive summary below contains the strategies and challenges of Tripadvisor for an understanding of the business objectives of Tripadvisor.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, which led to a decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, TripCo recorded a goodwill impairment of $279 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying value of the Hotels, Media and Platform reporting unit approximates its estimated fair value. Declines in the future revenue outlook, cash flows, or other changes in the business, may necessitate future impairments, which could be material. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial\nheadquarters lease in Needham, Massachusetts (Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease\u201d) recorded upon adoption of ASC 842 and to a lesser extent increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs.\nBased on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter of 2020 and the resulting impairment losses recorded, the estimated fair values of the trademark and Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit approximate their respective carrying values. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 environment and our inability to predict the expected duration and ultimate severity of the impact of COVID-19, the Company believes its reporting units and trademark are at an elevated risk of impairment in future periods. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial performance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nperformance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, TripCo's primary uses of cash were dividends paid by Tripadvisor to noncontrolling interests of $380 million, debt repayments of $359 million, including $259 million in principal payments on the VPF and $100 million in principal payments on the original margin loans, purchases of marketable securities of $133 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $108 million, capital expenditures of $83 million, share repurchases of $60 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $29 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, borrowings of debt of $235 million, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $150 million and derivative proceeds from counterparties of $71 million.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reportable segments was as follows:\nLiberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. ( TripCo\u201d or the Company\u201d) holds its subsidiary Tripadvisor, Inc. ( Tripadvisor\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, TripCo held an approximate 23% economic interest and 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor.\nDuring 2018, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% U.S. federal tax rate.", "item_7_text": "However, in May 2020, Tripadvisor amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor, and add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance with the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor also downsized the facility's borrowing capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date of the facility from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. These amendments also limit Tripadvisor from making certain payments and distributions, including share repurchases and dividends during the Leverage Covenant Holiday. During the Leverage Covenant Holiday, any future borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a 2.25% margin with a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum. Tripadvisor is also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, at an applicable rate of 0.5%, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter during the Leverage Covenant Holiday.\nTripadvisor's Long-term Growth Strategy\nIncome taxes. The Company had income tax benefits of $152 million, income tax benefits of $16 million, and income tax expenses of $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets from business acquisitions in previous years, partially offset by increased depreciation related to capitalized software and website development costs.\n \u25cf investing in technology (e.g. machine learning) to further improve the experiences Tripadvisor can deliver to consumers and travel partners on its platform; \n \u25cf driving consumer loyalty to Tripadvisor's platform by offering products and services that increase engagement with Tripadvisor's platform and result in membership growth, mobile app engagement and repeat usage; \nII-13\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor's Experiences & Dining segment's financial results were adversely and materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants across European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit, primarily based in Europe, had largely regained the revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, imposed new restrictions to try to mitigate the resurgence of the virus, which negatively and materially impacted this recent trend. Throughout the pandemic, Tripadvisor has explored new initiatives to delight and engage consumers. For example, Tripadvisor began offering virtual tours to its consumers and beta-launched an annual subscription-based membership, as discussed above, which offers consumers discounts on experience bookings.\nSee note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of new accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\n planned or annual subscription basis, both click-based and display-based media advertising, and experiences and restaurants; \nOverview\nII-6\nTripadvisor believes that its available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund Tripadvisor's foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt obligations, lease commitments and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Tripadvisor's future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, and/or other expenditures in support of its business strategy, and may potentially reduce Tripadvisor's cash balance and/or increase its borrowings under its 2015 Credit Facility or other borrowings. In addition, Tripadvisor's capital requirements may increase due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has already resulted in reduced revenue and operating cash flows for Tripadvisor, and the extent and duration to which it may continue to impact Tripadvisor's business is unclear. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to its liquidity and capital requirements, and therefore its capital structure.\nII-16\npresent value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value.\n \u25cf leveraging its platform's unique attributes to expand and grow its offerings, such as hotel business to business ( B2B\u201d) services, direct-to-consumer products and services where consumers pay Tripadvisor on a per trip \nIncome Taxes\nII-18\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Tripadvisor was in compliance with its covenants under the 2015 Credit Facility. While there can be no assurance that Tripadvisor will be able to meet the leverage ratio covenant after the Leverage Covenant Holiday expires, based on current projections, Tripadvisor does not believe there is a material risk it will not remain in compliance throughout the next twelve months.\n\n Interest expense. Interest expense increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of Tripadvisor's Senior Notes in July 2020 and higher average outstanding borrowings from its 2015 Credit Facility during 2020, partially offset by the repayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the first quarter of 2020. Interest expense decreased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower finance costs related to Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease under ASC 842 and no outstanding borrowings on Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility. These decreases at Tripadvisor were partially offset by increased corporate interest expense due to higher outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan agreement entered into by TripCo's bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook, TripCo recorded a trademark impairment of $250 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying fair value of the trademark approximates its estimated fair value. Further declines in Tripadvisor's future revenue outlook could result in a decrease in the fair value of the trademark. TripCo will continue to monitor events and circumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying value of Tripadvisor's trademark.\nIn Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, Tripadvisor enables travel partners to amplify their brand, generate brand impressions, and potentially drive qualified leads and bookings for their businesses. Historically, Tripadvisor has limited both the type and number of display-based advertising opportunities it makes available to travel partners, particularly on mobile phone, which, in turn, has limited display-based advertising revenue growth. However, Tripadvisor is continuing to work on initiatives to better leverage its audience, content, data, travel influence and platform breadth to open up new media advertising opportunities through a more modern, high-powered advertising suite spanning native, video and programmatic solutions. Tripadvisor intends to broaden its solution to a larger set of advertising travel endemic and non-travel endemic advertising partners, including industries such as airlines and finance.\nRevenue. Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform revenue decreased by $578 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment has two revenue sources, as described below: (1) Tripadvisor-branded hotels, which includes Hotel auction and B2B revenue; and (2) Tripadvisor-branded display and platform. The decreases in Hotels, Media & Platform revenue are detailed as follows:\nThe online travel industry is large and highly dynamic and competitive. Tripadvisor's overall strategy is to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners in order to generate more monetization on its platform. While Tripadvisor operates with a long-term growth focus, its specific growth objectives and resource allocation strategies can differ in both duration and magnitude within its segments. Descriptions of these dynamics, as well as the current trends affecting its overall business and reportable segments, key drivers of financial results, and uncertainties that may impact Tripadvisor's ability to execute on its objectives and strategies, are below.\nII-7\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe financial information represents the historical consolidated results of TripCo and its subsidiaries as discussed in note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the following discussion, TripCo and its subsidiaries are referred to as TripCo,\u201d the Company,\u201d us,\u201d we\u201d and our\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our business and make decisions about our resources. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business' performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\nII-12\nOther, net. The primary components of other, net are income and interest earned on money market funds and marketable securities offset by net foreign exchange losses. Other, net income decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the loss on the sale of certain Tripadvisor businesses, less interest income at Tripadvisor compared to the prior year, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt due to the mandatory prepayment of the TripCo Margin Loan during the three months ended March 31, 2020, partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange compared to losses in the prior year. Other, net income increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned from Tripadvisor's money market funds and other investments due to increased average interest rates and increased average invested funds during 2019.\n \u25cf opportunistically pursuing strategic acquisitions. \nWe have contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business including potential tax obligations associated with certain transactions following the formation of TripCo. Although it is reasonably possible we may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nII-2\nIn addition, Tripadvisor has historically and will continue to focus on initiatives to increase its traffic quality and deepen customer engagement on its platform, including driving membership growth, increasing personalization, and innovating its mobile app experience. Tripadvisor believes improving the user experience on its platform will lead to\nCurrent Trends Affecting Tripadvisor's Business\nII-5\nIn December 2019, TripAdvisor acquired U.K.-based Bookatable, which offers an online restaurant reservation and booking platform. This further strengthened Tripadvisor's position in certain of its existing European markets as well as expands Tripadvisor into new countries for its Dining offering, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Finland and Norway. TheFork's online restaurant booking platform, including Bookatable, had approximately 76,000 total bookable restaurants as of December 31, 2020.\nTripadvisor seeks to monetize its influence through hotel-related product improvements, supply and marketing efforts and customer advertising opportunities. Historically, Tripadvisor has generated a significant amount of hotel shoppers from search engines, such as Google. A hotel shopper is a visitor to Tripadvisor's sites that views either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. Tripadvisor's key ongoing objective related to traffic acquisition is to attract or acquire hotel shoppers at or above its desired marketing return on investment targets. Over the long-term, Tripadvisor is focused on driving a greater percentage of its traffic from direct traffic sources, which comes with little to no traffic acquisition costs.\nOperating Expense. Operating expense declined $101 million and increased $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant drivers of operating expense are technology and content costs, which decreased by $62 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due personnel and overhead costs across Tripadvisor's business as a result of a reduction in headcount driven by cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as reductions in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments. Technology and content costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth, partially offset by a decrease of personnel and overhead costs in Corporate and other as a result of strategic personnel re-allocation across the business.\n (4) This amount represents the redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock at December 31, 2020 and assumes that the Series A Preferred Stock will not be redeemed prior to the mandatory redemption date on March 26, 2025. \n \u25cf Making targeted reductions of Tripadvisor's office lease portfolio, primarily either through subleasing or allowing property leases to expire.  By the end of the third quarter of 2020, a majority of Tripadvisor's previously furloughed employees had returned to their jobs. However, during the fourth quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor again furloughed approximately 400 employees, primarily in its European operations of TheFork. This action taken by Tripadvisor was a direct result of the reinstatement of government restrictions related to restaurants in various countries within Europe, in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in those markets.\nII-8\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industry and consequently adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2020. Among other impacts, COVID-19 has negatively impacted global consumer demand and consumers' ability to travel, thereby resulting in many of Tripadvisor's travel partners operating at significantly reduced service levels.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense declined $364 million and $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The most significant driver of selling, general and administrative expense is selling and marketing expenses. These include direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate marketing commissions, social media costs, brand advertising (including television and other offline advertising), promotions and public relations. In addition, indirect sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.\nCorporate and other\nFollowing the trademark impairment, also during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed qualitative assessments for our reporting units and performed quantitative assessments for our Rentals and China reporting units and concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed.\nHistorically, Tripadvisor's operating cash flows have been sufficient to fund its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and long term debt obligations and other financial commitments and are expected to be sufficient in future periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Tripadvisor's Experiences & Dining segment revenue accounted for 31%, 29% and 23%, respectively, of total consolidated revenue. Experiences & Dining segment revenue decreased by $270 million or 59% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue growth in this segment was negatively impacted by a significant reduction in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with many jurisdictions globally adopting laws, rules, regulations or decrees intended to address COVID-19, including implementing various travel restrictions, shelter in place\u201d or social distancing\u201d mandates, or restricting access to city centers or popular tourist destinations, restaurants and limiting access to experience offerings in surrounding areas at various stages during the course of the year. Restaurants across many European markets saw restrictions ease during the second quarter of 2020, which was met with an increase in consumer demand. As a result, in the month of September 2020, TheFork business unit had largely regained its revenue level of the prior year's comparable period; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to try to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend. The negative impact of COVID-19 to this segment's revenue was partially offset by incremental revenue of approximately $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, related to Tripadvisor's December 2019 acquisitions of Bookatable and SinglePlatform. Experiences & Dining segment revenue increased by $84 million or 23% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by growth in both Experiences & Dining bookings, including increased bookings and revenue from Tripadvisor websites, partially offset by adverse changes in foreign currency, which Tripadvisor estimates negatively impacted Experiences & Dining revenue by 4%.\nFor consumers, Tripadvisor tests and implements product enhancements that deliver a more engaging and comprehensive hotel shopping experience. This includes providing rich, immersive content - reviews, photos, videos and ratings, among other contributions - as well as increasing the number of travel partners and properties as well as the available hotel supply on its platform. Tripadvisor believes providing consumers tools to discover, research, price shop and book a comprehensive selection of accommodations, helps increase brand awareness and brand loyalty and, over time, can result in deeper consumer engagement, more qualified leads delivered to travel partners and greater monetization on its platform.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility (as defined below) as a precautionary measure to reinforce its liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings during the third quarter of 2020. In May 2020, Tripadvisor amended its 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, suspend the leverage ratio covenant on this facility beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and ending prior to September 30, 2021 or such earlier date as elected by Tripadvisor (such period, the Leverage Covenant Holiday\u201d), add a minimum liquidity covenant to be applicable during the Leverage Covenant Holiday, secure the obligations under the agreement, as well as downsize the capacity of the facility to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion. In December 2020, Tripadvisor again amended the 2015 Credit Facility, to among other things, continue the suspension of the requirement for quarterly testing of compliance under the leverage ratio covenant until the earlier of (a) the first day after June 30, 2021 through maturity on which borrowings and other revolving credit utilizations under the revolving commitments exceed $200 million, and (b) the election of Tripadvisor (the Covenant Changeover Date\u201d), at which time the leverage ratio covenant will be reinstated. At this time, Tripadvisor also downsized the capacity to $500 million from $1.0 billion and extended the maturity date from May 12, 2022 to May 12, 2024. Tripadvisor believes this additional flexibility will be important given its continued limited ability to predict its future financial performance due to the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, as well as consumer behavior, and restrictive measures put in place in response to COVID-19.\nIn addition, certain other governments have passed legislation to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through loans, wage subsidies, tax relief or other financial aid. Some of these governments have extended or are considering extending these programs. Tripadvisor has participated in several of these programs, including the CARES Act in the U.S., the United Kingdom's job retention scheme, as well as other certain jurisdictions' programs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recognized government grants and other assistance benefits of $12 million as a reduction of personnel and overhead costs in the consolidated statements of operations.\nII-3\nOn February 18, 2021 the Company entered into a $25 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility matures on the earliest of (i) February 18, 2024, (ii) if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), the earlier of (a) the date that is 120 days from the date the holders of Series A Preferred Stock exercise their put rights or (b) the date the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed and (iii) 15 days following the consummation of certain change of control transactions. The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%. The Credit Facility will be drawn on primarily to cover corporate general and administrative expenses.\nRate) for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%; in addition to an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% ( ABR Spread\u201d), based on the Tripadvisor's leverage ratio.\nExperiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $84 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decrease in revenue noted above, partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to reduced consumer demand and lack of, or reduced, availability of dine-in restaurants, experiences and tours, at various stages during the course of the year as a result of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, decreased direct costs related to credit card payments and other transaction costs directly related to reduced revenue, and a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Experiences & Dining Adjusted OIBDA decreased $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to increased people costs to drive product and supply investments, as well as increased marketing investments to fund long-term growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in revenue, as noted above.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes corporate expenses.\nExperiences & Dining Segment\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\nIn March 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes numerous income tax provisions, some of which are effective retroactively. Tripadvisor anticipates that it will benefit from certain of these provisions and has accordingly recorded income tax benefits of $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCorporate and other is a combination of the Rentals, Flights & Car, and Cruise businesses. Profits and revenue have declined during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to Tripadvisor's other business units, and to a lesser extent, due to the sale of its SmarterTravel business in the second quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor operates these businesses opportunistically as they complement its overall strategic objectives to deliver more value to consumers and travel partners.\nIn addition, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on travel, regional and global markets, and overall economic activity remains difficult to predict. Therefore, the ultimate extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remains largely uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued resurgence and severity of the virus, continued transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the timing or extent of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine, mobility and travel restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on consumer travel behavior.\nII-15\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million of trademarks and $279 million of goodwill were recorded, respectively, related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit. The fair value of the trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of market multiples (market approach) and discounted cash flow (income approach) calculations (Level 3).\nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nAs of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand in global financial institutions, money market funds and marketable securities, with maturities of 90 days or less at the date purchased.\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill.\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\nTripadvisor has worked with travelers and travel partners to address cancellations, re-bookings, and in certain cases it has provided its travel partners extended payment terms, discounts and other incentives.\n\nTripadvisor's stock price declined in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayment of TripCo's Margin Loan (as defined in note 7 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares LTRIP LLC ( Certares\u201d), with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) (see note 10 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the impairment of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to incremental amortization for the right-of-use asset related to Tripadvisor's\nGeneral. We provide in the tables below information regarding our historical Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments.\nRecognition and Recoverability of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If, based on the qualitative analysis, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nWe are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nII-14\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported.\n\n (3) Expected interest payments on Tripadvisor's Senior Notes are based on a fixed interest rate of 7.0% as of December 31, 2020. \nhigher monetization over time. Further, Tripadvisor believes there remains an opportunity to continue to grow its member base, as well as to deepen member engagement by making membership more valued, building communities and leveraging its content to further personalize trip-planning features. As an example, during December 2020, Tripadvisor introduced direct-to-consumer initiatives, which included a beta-launch of an annual subscription-based membership that offers discounts to consumers for hotels and experiences, and also a travel concierge service that connects travelers with a curated community of expert trip designers in local travel destinations.\n Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $491 million and increased $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA decreased $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue, partially offset by reductions in television advertising costs, direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions. Hotels, Media & Platform Adjusted OIBDA increased $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to reduced direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition channels, and television advertising, which more than offset the decrease in revenue.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor's stock price fell sharply in March 2020, which triggered the mandatory prepayments of TripCo's Margin Loan. In order to repay the Margin Loan, TripCo entered into an agreement with Certares, with respect to 325,000 shares of TripCo's newly-created Series A Preferred Stock. As discussed in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, following March 26, 2021, Certares will have certain put rights to require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price for, at our election, cash, shares of Tripadvisor common stock, shares of our Series A or Series C common stock, provided that shares of our Series A or Series Common stock, as the case may be, are listed on a national securities exchange and are actively traded, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to certain limitations. Certares may exercise its put right by delivering notice to us within a certain number of days following our filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, and we will have 180 days from the delivery of such notice to redeem the outstanding Preferred Stock. If we determine not to redeem the Preferred Stock within that 180-day period, we may facilitate the sale of Certares' Preferred Stock and, if necessary, make Certares whole for any shortfall from the redemption price.\n \u25cf Enacting a workforce reduction eliminating more than 900 employees; \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, TripCo's primary use of cash was net debt repayments of $238 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with available cash, cash provided by operations and approximately $64 million in sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments and other marketable securities and borrowings of debt.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $108 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an overall decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, as well as lower television advertising costs, driven by the Hotels, Media & Platform segment and Corporate and other. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in similar marketing expenditures in the Experiences & Dining segment and increased personnel and overhead costs related to additional headcount in the Experiences & Dining segment to support business growth.\nAdditionally, Tripadvisor records liabilities to address uncertain tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or that are expected to be taken in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which a conclusion is reached that it is more likely than not it will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority is recognized. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\n \u25cf driving operational efficiencies; and \n\nII-19\n (2) Amounts (i) are stated at the face amount at maturity of our debt instruments, (ii) do not assume additional borrowings or refinancings of existing debt and (iii) assume interest rates remain at the December 31, 2020 rates. \nStock-based compensation. Stock based compensation decreased $19 million and increased $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in 2020 was due to workforce reductions and the reduction of targeted employee benefits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a modification that accelerated the vesting schedule of certain awards (see note 12 to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in 2019 was due to the continued grants of stock options.\nImpairment of intangible assets. Due to the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, and a sustained decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, impairments of $250 million for trademarks and $297 million for goodwill were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor recorded a $3 million impairment of goodwill related to its China business unit. Due to deteriorations in revenue, impairment losses of $288 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to trademarks. The trademarks were related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit.\n \u25cf Furloughing additional employees bringing the total furloughed employees during March and April 2020 to approximately 850 employees, primarily in Tripadvisor's European operations at TheFork; and \nExecutive Summary\nTripadvisor has also incurred significant and unanticipated cancellations by travelers related to future travel, accommodations and tour bookings, which had been reserved by travelers in the pre-COVID-19 timeframe, and included a significant number of bookings recorded as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. During the course of 2020,\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $69 million or 8% during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease was due to factors impacting Tripadvisor's hotel metasearch auction revenue, primarily reduced revenue generated through its SEO marketing channel, which Tripadvisor believes is impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue was also impacted by its progressive optimizations in search engine marketing, or SEM, and other online paid traffic acquisition spend, and to a lesser extent, the general trend of an increasing percentage of hotel shoppers visiting via mobile phones which monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Declines in Tripadvisor-branded hotels was partially offset, to a lesser extent, by growth in hotel sponsored placements revenue.\nrecorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to trademarks, related to the hotels, media & platform reporting unit.\nIn July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million in Senior Notes. The Senior Notes provide, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, at an interest rate of 7.000% per annum, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. In July 2020, Tripadvisor used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, or $490 million, net of approximately $10 million in deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Tripadvisor and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are not a registered security and there are no plans to register Tripadvisor's Senior Notes as a security in the future. As a result, Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC is not applicable and no separate financial statements are required for the guarantor subsidiaries.\nOur non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events and the initial recognition of such assets through the application of the purchase accounting method. If the carrying value of our definite lived intangible assets and long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets,\nRestructuring and other related reorganization costs. Tripadvisor incurred pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs consist of employee severance and related benefits. In response to COVID-19, and during the second quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor committed to restructuring actions intended to reinforce its financial position, reduce its cost structure, and improve operational efficiencies, resulting in headcount reductions, for which it recognized $32 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs. In addition, Tripadvisor engaged in a smaller scale restructuring action in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce its cost structure and improve its operational efficiencies, which resulted in headcount reductions for which Tripadvisor recognized $9 million in restructuring and other related reorganization costs.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable prepaid forward (as described in notes 5 and 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was primarily comprised of the change in the fair value of the variable postpaid forward. TripCo unwound the variable postpaid forward during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, monetization of our investments, outstanding or anticipated debt facilities, debt and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts.\nII-10\n \u25cf deepening travel partner engagement on Tripadvisor's platform by expanding the number of products and services offered; \nOperating Income (Loss). Our consolidated operating income (loss) declined $773 million and $287 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Operating income was impacted by the above explanations.\nOther Income and Expense\nStrategies and Challenges\nII-9\nCorporate and other revenue, which includes Rentals revenue, in addition to primarily click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue from Flights, Cars, and Cruises offerings on Tripadvisor websites, decreased by $108 million or 65% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreased consumer demand, similar to Tripadvisor's other businesses, as a result of COVID-19, and subsequent widespread global travel restrictions and service limitations on travel partners imposed by local and federal\n (1) Estimated future lease payments for Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease in Needham, Massachusetts and operating leases, primarily for office space, with non-cancelable lease terms. See note 8 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the composition of our reportable segments was revised. As a result of the change in reporting units, we assessed the recoverability of our goodwill and concluded the estimated fair values were in excess of the carrying values for these reporting units. Therefore, no indications of impairment were identified as a result of these changes in the first quarter of 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test for our trademarks. The fair value of our indefinite-lived trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method. Due to deteriorating revenue, an impairment loss of $288 million was\nAs of December 31, 2020, TripCo had a cash balance of $423 million. Approximately $418 million of the cash balance is held at Tripadvisor. Although TripCo has a 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor, Tripadvisor is a separate public company with a significant non-controlling interest, as TripCo has only a 23% economic interest in Tripadvisor. Even though TripCo controls Tripadvisor through its voting interest and board representation, decision making with respect to using Tripadvisor's cash balances must consider Tripadvisor's minority holders. Accordingly, any potential distributions of cash from Tripadvisor to TripCo would generally be on a pro rata basis based on economic ownership interests. Covenants in Tripadvisor's debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. See note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn response to the impact of COVID-19, Tripadvisor has taken several steps to further strengthen its financial position and balance sheet, and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility during 2020, including, but not limited to, restructuring activities, reducing its ongoing operating expenses and headcount, additional borrowings of debt, and amendments to Tripadvisor's 2015 Credit Facility, all of which are described in more detail below.\nAs part of Tripadvisor's long-term growth strategy, it favors continuous product innovation in order to deliver customers more value. In this regard, Tripadvisor beta-launched a direct-to-consumer annual subscription-based offering in December 2020.\nTripadvisor's Experiences & Dining offerings contribute to the comprehensive user experience it delivers, which Tripadvisor believes helps to increase awareness of, loyalty to, and engagement with its products, drive more bookings to Experiences & Dining partners and generate greater revenue and increased profitability on its platform. Given the significant market opportunities in these large categories, Tripadvisor expects to continue to invest in building these offerings to drive consumer engagement, bookings and revenue growth for the long-term.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor borrowed $700 million under the 2015 Credit Facility. These funds were drawn down as a precautionary measure to reinforce Tripadvisor's liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor repaid these borrowings in full during the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nHotels, Media & Platform Segment\nCorporate and other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $42 million and increased $8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, when compared to the same periods in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by a reduction in selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs in response to a decline in consumer demand related to COVID-19, a reduction in personnel costs as a result of workforce reductions and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to reduced costs related to marketing and operational re-alignments, primarily offset by a decrease in revenue, as described above. Corporate and other Adjusted OIBDA also includes $9 million, $8 million and $5 million of TripCo level selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTotal selling and marketing costs decreased $349 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs across all segments and businesses and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in television advertising costs in the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, driven by cost reduction measures primarily in response to the financial impact to Tripadvisor and decline in consumer demand caused by COVID-19. In addition, personnel and overhead costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of a reduction in headcount related to Tripadvisor's cost-reduction measures in response to COVID-19, as well as a reduction in personnel costs related to government grants and other assistance benefits received as COVID-19 relief from various governments.\nWhile we have seen varying degrees of containment of the virus in certain countries and some signs of travel recovery during points in time during 2020, the degree of containment and the recovery in travel has varied region-to-region globally, as well as state-to-state in the U.S. Most notably, a resurgence of COVID-19 has occurred again, after a period of decline, during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, followed by the reinstatement of government restrictions and mandates in certain geographies globally and the identification of new variants of the virus. There remains uncertainty around when remaining or reinstated restrictions will be lifted, where additional restrictions may be initiated, or where restrictions that have been previously lifted may be reinstated due to resurgence of the virus, nor is it clear when the short or long-term changes to consumer usage patterns on its platform or travel behavior patterns when travel bans and other government restrictions and mandates are fully lifted, or the timing of widespread distribution and administration of the vaccine globally. Tripadvisor believes the travel industry and its business will continue to be materially and adversely affected while such travel restrictions remain in place and COVID-19 continues to proliferate. Although Tripadvisor cannot predict with certainty the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its full year 2021 financial results, it currently expects that its first quarter 2021 financial results will continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic to a material degree.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility requires Tripadvisor to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility generally bear interest, at Tripadvisor's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Borrowing rate, or the adjusted LIBO rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing; plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% ( Eurocurrency Spread\u201d), based on the Company's leverage ratio; or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) Borrowing, which is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or LIBO rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve\nTripadvisor's business, including the Hotels, Media & Platform segment, has been adversely and materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was the primary and material driver of this segment's unfavorable results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as noted in the COVID-19 discussion above. During the third quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment demonstrated modest month-over-month performance improvements; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted this recent trend, particularly in its European business. In addition, most notably in the pre-COVID time period, Tripadvisor experienced revenue headwinds in its SEO marketing channel, which it believes has been impacted by search engines (primarily Google) increasing the prominence of their own hotel products in search results. Tripadvisor expects this trend may continue.\nCommencing in late February 2020 and progressively worsening through March 2020, Tripadvisor experienced a significant decline in user demand for its products and services, concurrent with intensifying concerns about COVID-19 on a global basis, in conjunction with widespread travel restrictions imposed by governments and businesses. The adverse impact to Tripadvisor's business from COVID-19 intensified in the second half of March, driven by the pandemic's proliferation and increased governmental restrictions and mandates globally that additionally impacted the travel, hospitality, restaurant and leisure industry and further dampened consumer demand for Tripadvisor's products and services. In the second half of March and throughout April, significant year-over-year revenue declines generally stabilized across Tripadvisor's segments and products which generally continued throughout the second quarter of 2020, and modestly improved during the third quarter of 2020. Tripadvisor's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 40% of the prior year's comparable period. In the second half of 2020, Tripadvisor's revenue averaged approximately 35% of the prior year's comparable period, while revenue performance in the months of November and December was approximately 33% of the prior year's comparable periods. This trend compares favorably to the trends observed in months of April 2020 and May 2020, where Tripadvisor's revenue for those months was approximately 10% of the prior year's comparable periods. In addition, traffic trends on Tripadvisor's websites have improved since the significant declines seen in the second half of March and throughout April 2020. In the second half of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites averaged approximately 67% of the prior year's comparable periods, while in April and May of 2020, monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites were approximately 33% and 45%, respectively, of the prior year's comparable periods, respectively. While Tripadvisor's revenue and traffic trends generally improved since April and May 2020, these trends began to flatten out in September 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, governments again, particularly in Europe, began to impose new restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which negatively impacted these recent trends, as monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites during the fourth quarter of 2020 declined to approximately 60% of the prior year's comparable period, in comparison to approximately 70% of the prior year's comparable period, during the third quarter of 2020.\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders. We had net losses attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders of $238 million, $22 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in net earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. shareholders were the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 19%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue, which consists of revenue from display-based advertising across all its websites. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue decreased $91 million or 57% during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in marketing spend from Tripadvisor's advertisers due to lack of consumer demand resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenue increased $7 million or 5% during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in pricing, and to a lesser extent, new initiatives launched in the later part of 2019.\nII-20\nTripadvisor's long-term growth strategy aims to increase customer engagement on its platform and drive profitable growth through:\nIn Tripadvisor's Hotels, Media & Platform segment its strategic objective is to preserve profit and drive increased customer engagement and monetization on the Tripadvisor platform. Tripadvisor seeks to achieve this by delivering consumers compelling products and holistic user experience as well as by offering travel partners a diverse set of advertising opportunities.\n (5) Includes purchase obligations, expected commitment fee payments on the Tripadvisor 2015 Credit Facility (as defined in note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and long term income taxes payable. \nDuring 2019, the Company recognized additional tax expense for changes in unrecognized tax benefits and dividends from Tripadvisor not recognized for book purposes, net of a dividends received deduction. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% United States ( U.S.\u201d) federal tax rate and federal income tax credits.\nII-17\nDuring the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tripadvisor instituted additional cost reduction measures, including the elimination of the majority of discretionary spending, business travel, non-critical vendor relationships, brand advertising, cessation of nearly all new hiring and contingent staff, reduction of targeted employee benefits, and the furloughing of over 100 employees. On April 28, 2020, management approved and Tripadvisor announced an additional cost reduction initiative in response to the continued economic and financial impacts to Tripadvisor as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included the following:\nThe projected use of TripCo's corporate cash will primarily be to pay fees (not expected to exceed $4 million annually) to Liberty Media for providing certain services pursuant to the services agreement and the facilities sharing agreement, payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (unless added to the liquidation preference or paid in shares of Series A common stock of TripCo), and to pay any other corporate level expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor incurred total pre-tax restructuring and other related reorganization costs of approximately $41 million as a result of these measures, all of which were paid by Tripadvisor as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Tripadvisor instituted a cost reduction initiative to preserve cash flows, including targeted workforce reduction measures largely in the Experiences & Dining segment and optimizing and reducing brand advertising as Tripadvisor pivots to leverage newer mediums it believes will be more effective than its historically television-focused campaign.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor was party to a credit agreement with a group of lenders, initially entered in June 2015 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), which, among other things, provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of May 12, 2024.\nOn November 1, 2019, Tripadvisor's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.50 per share, or approximately $488 million in the aggregate. The dividend was payable on December 4, 2019 to stockholders of record on November 20, 2019. TripCo received approximately $108 million based on our ownership in Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor funded this special cash dividend with available cash primarily from the U.S. and to a lesser extent from a foreign subsidiary, with no material related income tax impacts.\nII-4\ngovernments at various stages during the course of the year, and reduced travel partner spend in response to COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, the sale of Tripadvisor's SmarterTravel business during the second quarter of 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, TripCo's primary uses of cash were repayments of debt of $1,052 million, which includes repayment of the principal amount of the Margin Loan of $352 million, repurchases of Tripadvisor common stock of $115 million, capital expenditures of $55 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $21 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with borrowings of debt of $1,240 million and the issuance of redeemable preferred stock of $325 million (see note 7 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nTripadvisor-branded hotels revenue primarily includes hotel auction revenue, and to a lesser extent, hotel B2B revenue, which includes click-based revenue generated from hotel sponsored placement advertising that enable hotels to enhance their visibility on Tripadvisor hotel pages, and subscription-based advertising services that Tripadvisor offers to travel partners. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 81%, 83% and 85%, respectively, of Tripadvisor's total Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue was derived from Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue. Tripadvisor-branded hotels revenue decreased $487 million or 63% during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, concurrent with widespread travel restrictions and service limitations on our travel partners imposed by local and federal governments at various stages during the course of the year in response to the pandemic.\nII-11\n \u25cf building products that delight travelers by reducing friction throughout the travel planning and trip-taking journey; \nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $91 million of TripCo cash and cash equivalents is held by Tripadvisor foreign subsidiaries, of which approximately 30% was located in the U.K., with the majority of Tripadvisor's international cash denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and, to a lesser extent, British pounds, Australian dollars and other currencies. As of December 31, 2020, Tripadvisor had $494 million of cumulative undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d), foreign earnings may now generally be repatriated back to the U.S. without incurring U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31, 2020, $376 million of Tripadvisor's cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. See note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations, excluding uncertain tax positions as it is undeterminable when payments will be made, is summarized below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn addition, in July 2020, Tripadvisor completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in a private offering. The Indenture pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued provides, among other things, that interest will be payable on the Senior Notes at 7.000% per annum, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2021, until their maturity date of July 15, 2025. Tripadvisor used the net proceeds received of $490 million, net of deferred financing costs, to repay a portion of its 2015 Credit Facility borrowings.\nResults for TripCo are largely dependent upon the operating performance of Tripadvisor. Therefore, the executive summary below contains the strategies and challenges of Tripadvisor for an understanding of the business objectives of Tripadvisor.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor's operating results, which led to a decline in Tripadvisor's stock price, TripCo recorded a goodwill impairment of $279 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, related to the hotels, media and platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying value of the Hotels, Media and Platform reporting unit approximates its estimated fair value. Declines in the future revenue outlook, cash flows, or other changes in the business, may necessitate future impairments, which could be material. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial\nheadquarters lease in Needham, Massachusetts (Tripadvisor's Headquarters Lease\u201d) recorded upon adoption of ASC 842 and to a lesser extent increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs.\nBased on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter of 2020 and the resulting impairment losses recorded, the estimated fair values of the trademark and Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit approximate their respective carrying values. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 environment and our inability to predict the expected duration and ultimate severity of the impact of COVID-19, the Company believes its reporting units and trademark are at an elevated risk of impairment in future periods. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor's financial performance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nperformance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, TripCo's primary uses of cash were dividends paid by Tripadvisor to noncontrolling interests of $380 million, debt repayments of $359 million, including $259 million in principal payments on the VPF and $100 million in principal payments on the original margin loans, purchases of marketable securities of $133 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $108 million, capital expenditures of $83 million, share repurchases of $60 million and payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements on equity awards of $29 million. These uses of cash were funded primarily with cash provided by operations, borrowings of debt of $235 million, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $150 million and derivative proceeds from counterparties of $71 million.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reportable segments was as follows:\nLiberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. ( TripCo\u201d or the Company\u201d) holds its subsidiary Tripadvisor, Inc. ( Tripadvisor\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, TripCo held an approximate 23% economic interest and 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor.\nDuring 2018, the Company recognized additional tax expense related to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. These expense items were partially offset by a net income tax benefit from earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates other than the 21% U.S. federal tax rate.", "item_7_tables": "Table 130:
