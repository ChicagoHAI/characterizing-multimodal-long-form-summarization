Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, together in each case with the related notes, included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nWe are a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor platform solutions for communications, IoT applications, consumer, computing, industrial and automotive applications. We have a proven record with more than 40 years of operating history, a portfolio of approximately 1,150 registered patents and pending applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise.\nOur standard products business includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines.\nOur Display Solutions line of products provide flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small flat panel displays. These products include source and gate drivers and timing controllers that cover a wide range of flat panel displays used in mobile communications, automobiles, entertainment devices, notebook PCs, monitors and liquid crystal display (LCD), organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and Micro light emitting diode (Micro LED) televisions. Our Display Solutions products support some of the industry's most advanced display technologies, such as OLEDs, low temperature polysilicons thin film transistors (LTPS TFTs), as well as high-volume display technologies such as amorphous silicon thin film transistors (a-Si\nTFTs). Since 2007, we have designed and manufactured OLED display driver integrated circuit (IC) products. Our current portfolio of OLED solutions address a wide range of resolutions ranging from HD (High Definition) to WQHD (Wide Quadruple High Definition) for applications including smartphones, TVs, and other mobile devices.\nOur Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing, servers, automotive, and industrial applications. These products include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), AC-DC/DC-DC\nconverters, LED drivers, regulators and power management integrated circuits (PMICs) for a range of devices, including televisions, smartphones, mobile phones, wearable devices, desktop PCs, notebooks, tablet PCs, other consumer electrics, automotive, and industrial applications such as power suppliers, e-bikes,\nphotovoltaic inverters, LED lighting and motor drives.\nOur wide variety of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products combined with our mature technology platform allow us to address multiple high-growth end markets and rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands. Our design center and substantial manufacturing operations in Korea place us at the core of the global electronics device supply chain. We believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers' needs, and allows us to better serve and capture additional demand from existing and new customers. Certain of our OLED products are produced using external 12-inch\nfoundries. Through a strategic cooperation with external 12-inch\nfoundries, we are managing to ensure outsourcing wafers at competitive price and produce quality products.\nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce. We must understand our customers' needs as well\nas the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve. We must also invest in relevant research and development activities and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers' demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow.\nThe semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence.\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer and industrial products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we continually strive to diversify our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our worldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nNet sales for our standard products business are driven by design wins in which we are selected by an electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product. A customer will often have more than one supplier designed into multi-source components for a particular product line. Once we have design wins and the products enter into mass production, we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time, with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market\ndemand for the goods in which our products are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and, in some cases, allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers.\nIn contrast to completely fabless semiconductor companies, our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over certain manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements for our internally manufactured products, which can favorably impact gross profit margins. Our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules, improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation on these internally manufactured products. However, having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under-utilization of manufacturing capacity that results in lower gross profit margins, particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry.\nOur standard products business requires investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch\nand 8-inch\nwafer capacity, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED). We believe this balanced capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nSince 2007, we had designed and manufactured OLED display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to an external 12-inch\nfoundry starting in the second half of 2015 and we have started outsourcing 8-inch\nwafer for OLED TV IC after the sale of our fabrication facility located in Cheongju. This additional source of manufacturing is an increasingly important part of our supply chain management. By outsourcing manufacturing of OLED products to external foundries, we are able to adapt dynamically to changing customer requirements and address growing markets without substantial capital investments by us. However, relying on external foundries exposes us to the risk of being unable to secure manufacturing capacity, particularly under the current global shortage of foundry services. Although we are working strategically with external foundries to ensure long-term wafer capacity, if these efforts are unsuccessful, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our relationship with customers and opportunities to secure new design-wins.\nOur success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors. Additionally, we must innovate to remain ahead of, or at least rapidly adapt to, technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services. We believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our awareness of new product opportunities, market and technology trends and improve our ability to adapt and grow successfully.\nRecent Developments\nAccelerated Stock Repurchase Program\nOn December 21, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock and we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement\u201d) with JPM to repurchase an aggregate of $37.5 million of our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement dated December 21, 2021, we paid to JPM $37.5 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 994,695 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $20.1 million and a price per share of $20.18 on December 22, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we accounted for the remaining portion of the ASR Agreement as a forward contract indexed to our common stock and recorded $17.4 million in additional paid-in\ncapital in stockholders' equity in our consolidated balance sheets. The final number of shares to be delivered will be based on our volume-weighted average stock price under the terms of the ASR Agreement less an agreed upon discount.\nThe ASR Agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type, including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances under which the ASR Agreement may be accelerated, extended or terminated early by JPM and various acknowledgments, representations and warranties made by the parties to one another. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement is expected to occur during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022.\nAdditional details about the ASR Agreement are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K\nfiled by us with the SEC on December 21, 2021.\nRights Plan\nWe entered into a Rights Agreement, dated as of December 13, 2021, with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (the Rights Agreement\u201d), and the Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right\u201d and collectively, the Rights\u201d) for each share\nof our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, outstanding at the close of business on December 23, 2021. Each Right, once exercisable, will entitle the registered holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth\nof a share of Series A-1\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $80, subject to adjustment (the Purchase Price\u201d). The Rights are not presently exercisable and remain attached to the shares of common stock unless and until the occurrence of the earlier of the following (the Distribution Date\u201d): (i) the tenth day after the public announcement or disclosure by us or any person or group of affiliated or associated persons that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons has become an Acquiring Person\u201d by obtaining beneficial ownership of 12.5% (or 20% in the case of a passive institutional investor,\u201d which is defined generally as any person who has reported beneficial ownership of shares of common stock on Schedule 13G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or more of our outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions; or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as our Board of Directors may designate before a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after (and not including) the commencement of, or first public announcement of the intent of any person to commence, a tender or exchange offer by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons, which would, if consummated, result in such person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. The Board of Directors may redeem all of the Rights for $0.001 per Right at any time before any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person. In addition, at any time on or after any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person (but before any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes the owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock), the Board of Directors may exchange all or part of the Rights (other than the Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right. The Rights will expire at the close of business on December 12, 2022, unless redeemed or exchanged prior to that time.\nIf any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, then, after the Distribution Date, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons or transferees thereof) will entitle the holder to purchase, for the Purchase Price, a number of shares of common stock having a market value of twice the Purchase Price. Alternatively, if, after any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, (1) we are involved in a merger or other business combination in which we are not the surviving corporation or our common stock is changed into or exchanged for other securities or assets; or (2) we or one or more of our subsidiaries sell or otherwise transfer assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, then each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) will entitle the holder to purchase, for the Purchase Price, a number of shares of common stock of the other party to such business combination or sale (or in certain circumstances, an affiliate) having a market value of twice the Purchase Price.\nAdditional details about the Rights Agreement are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K\nfiled by us with the SEC on December 14, 2021.\nThe Terminated Merger\nOn March 25, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with South Dearborn Limited, an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability ( Parent\u201d), formed by an affiliate of Wise Road Capital LTD, and Michigan Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub would be merged with and into us (the Merger\u201d), with us continuing our corporate existence as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nThe closing of the Merger was subject to certain conditions, including clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS\u201d) under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. We and Parent were advised that CFIUS clearance of the Merger would not be forthcoming and received permission\nfrom CFIUS to withdraw our joint filing. In connection therewith, we and Parent entered into a Termination and Settlement Agreement, dated December 13, 2021 (the Termination Agreement\u201d), which was attached as Exhibit 10.1 in our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated\nDecember 13, 2021.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Merger Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Termination Agreement after our receipt of a fee of $51.0 million from Parent and a new standby letter of credit, which secures a deferred fee of $19.2 million from Parent due on or before March 31, 2022.\nWe recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $70.2 million income as part of merger-related costs (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in our consolidated balance sheet a $19.2 million deferred fee as other receivables at December 31, 2021.\nGlobal Semiconductor Chip Shortage\nRecent sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products have resulted in a global shortage of manufacturing capacity. As a result, we may experience increased costs to manufacture our products and may not be able to manufacture and deliver all of the orders placed by our customers. Specifically, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacity from the external foundries we rely on, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, this shortage of manufacturing capacity may lead to an increase in our manufacturing costs which we may not be fully able to pass on to our customers. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by these persisting supply shortages, in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nOLED wafers.\nIn an effort to minimize the potential adverse impact of the supply shortage, we are working strategically with certain external foundries to help ensure long-term wafer capacity. If these efforts are unsuccessful, however, such shortage could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in the future, which would adversely affect our reputation and competitive position, resulting in a negative impact on results of operations.\nWe are not able to foresee when the current shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside. A prolonged global supply shortage could negatively impact our financial condition, potentially resulting in a need for additional capital to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities.\nConversion of 5.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2021 (the Exchangeable Notes\u201d)\nPrior to the March 1, 2021 maturity of our Exchangeable Notes, holders thereof elected to exchange the Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate of 10,144,131 shares of our common stock in satisfaction in full of the outstanding obligations under the Exchangeable Notes. On March 1, 2021, we paid the final interest payment on the Exchangeable Notes of $2.1 million and no longer have any Exchangeable Notes obligations outstanding as of such date.\nVoluntary Resignation Program\nOn October 16, 2020, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the Program\u201d), which was available for all employees. In connection with the Program, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $4.4 million of termination related charges within early termination and other charges, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRedemption of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d)\nWe completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. We paid approximately $227.4 million to fully redeem all of the outstanding $224.25 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest through but excluding the redemption date. The redemption of the 2021 Notes was funded by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of intercompany loans using the cash proceeds that it received from the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. On October 12, 2020, we paid a withholding tax of approximately $20.6 million, attributable to the repaid accrued interests on the related intercompany loans.\nCompletion of Sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4\nOn September 1, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to Key Foundry Co., Ltd. (the Buyer\u201d) in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion. In addition to the purchase price, the Buyer assumed all severance liabilities relating to the transferred employees, which had a value of approximately $100 million.\nThe divestiture of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 was to strategically shift our operational focus to the standard products business. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Accordingly, we have one reportable segment: our standard products business, together with transitional foundry services associated with our fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as Fab 3, which we expect to perform for the Buyer up to September 1, 2023 (the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services\u201d).\nPower Outage\nOn July 20, 2020, our Fab 3 facility in Gumi, South Korea experienced a temporary power outage for approximately 9 hours and 15 minutes. The recovery from this power outage took longer than expected, which limited our ability to produce products in Fab 3 at full capacity, resulting in a lower factory utilization primarily during the third quarter of 2020. The accident caused certain damage to our work in process wafers and we incurred charges for facility recovery, resulting in an incremental cost of approximately $1.2 million.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus causing a disease known as COVID-19\nsurfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in significant disruptions among Chinese manufacturing and other facilities and travel throughout China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19\noutbreak a pandemic. Governmental authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place\norders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19\nhave, in some cases, resulted in the re-imposition\nof certain restrictions and containment measures, and may continue to lead to other restrictions being re-implemented\nin the foreseeable future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19.\nWe experienced some minor disruption in our Power Solutions business from assembly and test subcontractors located in China in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. To date, our external Display Solutions business contractors and sub-contractors\nhave not been materially impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. We are, however, unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19\npandemic will have on future results of operations due to numerous uncertainties. The extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which, despite progress in vaccination efforts, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19\npandemic, such as new strains of the virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants and any\nfuture variants that may emerge, which may impact rates of infection and vaccination efforts, developments or perceptions regarding the safety of vaccines and the extent and effectiveness of actions to contain the COVID-19\npandemic or treat its impact, including vaccination campaigns and lockdown measures, among others. In addition, recurrences or additional waves of COVID-19\ncases could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of our customers and suppliers were to experience prolonged business shutdowns or other disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this ongoing and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.\nExplanation and Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP\nMeasures\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) in this Report. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-U.S.\nGAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, net, (v) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (vi) expenses related to Fab 3 power outage, (vii) merger-related costs (income), net and (viii) early termination and other charges, net. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense (income), net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization.\nSee the footnotes to the table below for further information regarding these items. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance because:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, by eliminating the impact of a number of items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance, provides a more comparable measure of our operating performance from period-to-period\nand may be a better indicator of future performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly requested and used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company as an enterprise level performance measure that eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as other one time or recurring items described above; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, among other reasons, to assess a company's period-to-period\ncore operating performance and to understand and assess the manner in which management analyzes operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA in a number of ways, including:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> to evaluate the effectiveness of our enterprise level business strategies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> in certain of our compensation plans as a performance measure for determining incentive compensation payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We prepare Adjusted Operating Income by adjusting operating income to eliminate the impact of equity-based compensation expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Operating Income is useful to investors to provide a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nAdjusted Operating Income is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Operating Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Operating Income, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation.

We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Net Income only as a supplement.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nNet\nSales.\nWe derive substantially all of our sales (net of sales returns and allowances) from our standard products business. We outsource manufacturing of mobile OLED products to external 12-inch\nfoundries. Our product inventory is primarily located in Korea and is available for drop shipment globally. Outside of Korea, we maintain limited product inventory, and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in Korea for fulfillment. We have strategically located our sales offices near concentrations of major customers. Our sales offices are located in Korea, Japan and Greater China. Our network of authorized agents and distributors is in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.\nWe recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we sold products to 177, 178 and 180 customers, respectively, and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented 80%, 88% and 90% of our net sales-standard products business, respectively.\nWe will provide the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services up to September 1, 2023 at an agreed upon cost plus a mark-up.\nFor the periods prior to the closing of the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 as of September 1, 2020 (which are accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2020), revenue derived from the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services is recorded at cost in both our continuing and discontinued operations.\nGross Profit.\nOur overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services. Other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix, the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services, shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facility and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations, changes in material, labor and other manufacturing costs including outsourced manufacturing expenses, and variation in depreciation expense.\nAverage\nSelling\nPrices.\nAverage selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\nMaterial Costs.\nOur material costs consist of costs of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and tape and packaging supplies. We use processes that require specialized raw materials, such as silicon wafers, that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supplies decrease, the costs of our raw materials could increase significantly.\nLabor\nCosts.\nA significant portion of our employees are located in Korea. Under Korean labor laws, most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of our employees were eligible for severance benefits.\nDepreciation Expense.\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40\nyears on buildings to 5 to 12 years for certain equipment and assets. Our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections. If our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long-lived assets, the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced, with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value.\nSelling\nExpenses.\nWe sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to OEMs, including major branded customers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through distributors. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our direct sales force, a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution. Personnel costs include base salary, benefits and incentive compensation.\nGeneral\nand\nAdministrative\nExpenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations, including finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. These expenses primarily consist of payroll-related expenses, consulting and other professional fees and office facility-related expenses.\nResearch\nand\nDevelopment.\nThe rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring\nengineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our display business are material and design-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving 28-nanometer\nor finer processes. The majority of research and development expenses of our power business are certain equipment, material and design-related costs for power discrete products and material and design-related costs for power IC products. Power IC uses standard BCD process technologies which can be sourced from multiple foundries, including Fab 4.\nInterest Expense.\nOur interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes. We redeemed all outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Our Exchangeable Notes were exchanged for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021. From and after October 2, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we have not incurred interest expense associated with the 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes, respectively.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations.\nHistorically, a portion of our revenues and cost of sales and greater than the majority of our operating expenses have been denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because\nwe report our results of operations in U.S. dollars converted from our non-U.S.\nrevenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in U.S. dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash\ntranslation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of U.S. dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Obligations under these foreign currency zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by a counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our credit rating falls below B-/B3\nor if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than $30.0 million at the end of a fiscal quarter unless a waiver is obtained from the counterparty. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations. See Note 10. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our foreign exchange hedging activities.\nForeign Currency Gain or Loss.\nForeign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries' functional currency are included in foreign currency gain (loss), net in our statements of operations. A substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non-cash\ntranslation gain or loss related to the principal balance of intercompany balances at our Korean subsidiary that are denominated in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss results from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Korean won and U.S. dollar.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end\nwill be realized in future periods. In such assessment, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based\ntax examinations by tax authorities of the U.S., Korea and multiple other foreign jurisdictions for all open tax years. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income- or non-income\nbased taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result.\nDiscontinued Operations.\nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Business Transfer Agreement for the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to the Buyer. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale for a purchase price of approximately $350.6 million in cash.\nCapital\nExpenditures.\nWe primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nInventories.\nWe monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations. We may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand, cost in excess of market value and product age. Our analysis may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products, product age, customer design activity, customer concentration and other factors. These forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments. Our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our operations,

This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line, which was partially offset by an increase in net sales from our Power Solutions business line as described below.\nThe standard products business.\nNet sales from our standard products business were $433.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $32.4 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a continuing severe global shortage in manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nOLED wafers), as we outsource manufacturing of these products to external 12-inch\nfoundries, and a strategic reduction of our lower margin non-auto\nLCD business, which was offset in part by a higher demand for auto-LCD\nDDIC business. The increase in net sales from our Power Solutions business line was attributable to a strong demand for power products such as MOSFETs, including high-end\nMOSFETs, primarily for TVs and e-bikes,\nwhereas the revenue for power products in 2020 was impacted by COVID-19-related\nsupply chain issues and market softness in China.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit was $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $128.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a $25.2 million, or 19.7%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 32.4% compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenues from our standard products business as further described below.\nThe standard products business.\nGross profit from our standard products business was $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a $22.5 million, or 17.7%, increase from $127.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 34.5% compared to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an improved product mix, an increase in average selling price benefited from the favorable pricing environment and a higher utilization rate of our internal fabrication facility in Gumi, whereas unexpected excess and obsolete inventory charge of $1.5 million in relation to the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, negatively affected both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. This excess and obsolete inventory charge was reversed in full during 2021 as such reserved inventory was subsequently sold to certain other customers, which also positively affected both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nWe report net sales-standard products business by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed.

This increase was offset in part by a decrease in revenue related to our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a continuing severe global shortage in manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nOLED wafers), as we outsource manufacturing of these products to external 12-inch\nfoundries, and a strategic reduction of our lower margin non-auto\nLCD business. The U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, also unfavorably impacted the demand for certain of our mobile OLED display driver ICs from our customers.\nNet sales-standard products business in the Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased from $347.6 million to $306.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, or by $41.3 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a continuing global shortage in manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nOLED wafers), as we outsource manufacturing of these products to external 12-inch\nfoundries, which was offset in part by a higher demand for power products such as MOSFETs, including high-end\nMOSFETs, primarily for TVs and e-bikes,\nand a higher demand for auto-LCD\nDDIC business.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $52.4 million, or 11.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $50.0 million, or 9.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year increase of $2.5 million, or 4.9%, was primarily attributable to certain non-income-based\ntax assessments of $0.6 million as a result of a regular tax examination completed for our primary operating entity in Korea for multiple tax years, the grant timing of equity-based compensation, and increased depreciation and amortization expense, which was primarily attributable to certain one-time\ninvestments relating to separating the IT systems and establishing a new IT infrastructure to support our continuing operations after the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4.\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $51.2 million, or 10.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $45.7 million, or 9.0%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $5.5 million, or 12.1%, was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs, outside service fees and variable overhead expenses.\nMerger-related Costs (Income), Net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which was offset in part by a $34.7 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $0.7 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction.\nEarly Termination and Other Charges, Net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.4 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by a $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end\nline in our fabrication facility in Gumi (which was closed during the year ended December 31, 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives.\nOperating Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income of $83.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to operating income of $27.0 million the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating income of $56.4 million resulted primarily from a $36.2 million net increase in merger-related income, a $25.2 million increase in gross profit, and a $3.0 million decrease in early termination and other charges, which was offset in part by a $5.5 million increase in research and development expenses and a $2.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1.4 million compared to $18.1 million of interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expenses was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes. We redeemed all outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Our Exchangeable Notes were exchanged for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021. From and after October 2, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we have not incurred interest expense associated with the 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes, respectively.\nForeign Currency Loss, Net.\nNet foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $11.9 million compared to net foreign currency loss of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net foreign currency losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were due to the depreciation in the value of the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar during each period.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash\ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million and $378.9 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Borrowings, Net.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $0.8 million of loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, which was attributable to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. In connection with the redemption of the 2021 Notes, we reclassified the remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on the redemption date as a loss on early extinguishment of borrowings.\nOthers, Net.\nOthers were comprised of interest income, rental income, and gains and losses from valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments. Others, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Others, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a $0.7 million legal settlement gain related to certain expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with our legacy Fab 4 (which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2020) and awarded in the third quarter of 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates.\nWe recorded a $17.3 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily composed of the income tax expense of $6.9 million from our Korean subsidiary, primarily due to its taxable income for the year, and the income tax expense of $8.2 million from the parent entity in the U.S. The U.S. parent's tax expense was mainly attributable to the recognition of income and expenses related to the Merger combined with the utilization of its available net operating loss carry-forwards.\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome from Continuing Operations\nIncome from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $56.7 million compared to income from continuing operations of $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $0.4 million decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to a $63.5 million net increase in income tax expense and an $11.5 million increase in net foreign currency loss, which was offset in part by a $56.4 million increase in operating income and a $16.8 million decrease in interest expense.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Business Transfer Agreement for the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $287.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. We have not incurred a gain or loss from discontinued operations in 2021 as the sale of the Foundry Service Group business and Fab 4 was completed in 2020.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income of $56.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $345.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As discussed above, the decrease in net income of $288.3 million primarily resulted from a $287.9 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and a $0.4 million decrease in income from continuing operations.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2020, a $13.6 million, or 2.6%, decrease compared to $520.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our standard products business as described below.\nThe standard products business.\nNet sales from our standard products business were $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $19.3 million, or 4.0%, decrease compared to $484.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line was primarily attributable to a strategic reduction of our lower margin non-auto\nLCD DDIC business, which was offset in part by an increase in revenue related to our mobile OLED display driver ICs due to an increase in demand for production of OLED smartphones by Chinese manufacturers in the second half of 2020 due in part to the geographic diversification of our OLED product portfolio. This increase continued until the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, impacted the shipment of certain mobile OLED display driver ICs to certain of our customers. The decrease in net sales from our Power Solutions business line was primarily attributable to the significant global macro-economic market disruption in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19\npandemic and the Fab 3 power outage, which affected our ability to meet customer demand for some of our Power Solution products during the third quarter of 2020.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit was $128.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an $11.9 million, or 10.2%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 25.3% compared to 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was due to the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenues from our standard products business as further described below.\nThe standard products business.\nGross profit from our standard products business was $127.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a $10.7 million, or 9.2%, increase from $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 27.3% compared to 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to inventory reserves related to certain legacy display products that were recorded in the first half of 2019 and an improved product mix, which was offset in part by an $1.5 million unexpected excess and obsolete inventory charge that we recorded in the second half of 2020 in relation to the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers. The delayed recovery of Fab 3 from the power outage, resulting in a lower than anticipated utilization rate, also negatively affected both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2020.\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nWe report net sales-standard products business by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed.

The revenue related to our mobile OLED display driver IC remained flat year over year.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $50.0 million, or 9.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $47.6 million, or 9.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $2.4 million, or 5.0%, was primarily attributable to an increase in certain employee incentives, including equity-based compensation and professional fees, which were mainly comprised of legal and consulting services. This increase was offset in part by a $0.5 million legal settlement charge related to dispute with a prior customer recorded in the first quarter of 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $45.7 million, or 9.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $45.0 million, or 8.6%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.7 million, or 1.5%, was primarily attributable to an increase in certain employee incentives, including equity-based compensation, which was offset in part by decreased material costs.\nMerger-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $0.7 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction.\nEarly Termination and Other Charges.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives.\nOperating Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income of $27.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to operating income of $23.7 million the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in operating income of $3.3 million resulted primarily from an $11.9 million increase in gross profit, which was offset in part by a $4.9 million increase in early termination and other charges, a $2.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, a $0.7 million increase in research and development expenses and a $0.7 million increase in merger-related costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18.1 million compared to $22.2 million of interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $4.0 million decrease in interest expenses was attributable to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. We did not incur interest expense associated with the 2021 Notes from and after October 2, 2020.\nForeign Currency Loss, Net.\nNet foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.4 million compared to net foreign currency loss of $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net foreign currency losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were due to the depreciation in the value of the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar during each period.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash\ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $378.9 million and $686.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the outstanding intercompany loan balances including accrued interest was primarily attributable to our Korean subsidiary's repayment of certain loans by our Dutch subsidiary to fund the redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Borrowings, Net.\nLoss on early extinguishment of borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.8 million compared to $0.04 million of loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.7 million increase in loss on early extinguishment of borrowings was attributable to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. In connection with the redemption of the 2021 Notes, we reclassified the remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on the redemption date as a loss on early extinguishment of borrowings.\nOthers, Net.\nOthers were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates.\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $3.8 million income tax expenses, primarily attributable to interest on intercompany loan balances, which was offset in part by an income tax benefit of $1.7 million, resulting in a net income tax expense of $2.2 million. The income tax benefit of $1.7 million was due to the application of the exception rule under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d) in connection with the intra-period allocation, which resulted in tax benefits in our continuing operations and tax expenses in the discontinued operations for an equal and offsetting amount for the presentation purposes only.\nIncome (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nIncome from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $57.1 million compared to loss from continuing operations of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $77.5 million improvement in results from continuing operations was primarily attributable to a $48.4 million improvement in income tax expense, a $21.9 million improvement in net foreign currency loss, a $4.0 million decrease in interest expense and a $3.3 million increase in operating income.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $287.9 million compared to loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $289.3 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax primarily resulted from a $287.1 million increase in gain on sale of discontinued operations, a $10.8 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $9.2 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $7.6 million increase in gross profit due in part to depreciation and amortization associated with the assets classified as those held for sale having been ceased starting in the second quarter of 2020, which were offset in part by a $10.8 million increase in transaction costs, a $8.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $6.7 million increase in restructuring and other charges.\nNet Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income of $345.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As discussed above, the increase in net income of $366.8 million primarily resulted from a $289.3 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, mainly attributable to the completion of the sale of the Foundry Service Group business and Fab 4, and a $77.5 million improvement in loss from continuing operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements are to fund sales and marketing, invest in research and development and capital equipment, and to fund working capital needs. We calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our financing activities. Our ability to manage cash and cash equivalents may be limited, as our primary cash flows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, we may sell accounts receivable to third parties under factoring agreements or engage in accounts receivable discounting to facilitate the collection of cash. For a description of our factoring arrangements and accounts receivable discounting, please see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4. Accounts Receivable\u201d included elsewhere in this Report. In addition, from time to time, we may make payments to our vendors on extended terms with their consent. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any accounts payable on extended terms or payment deferment with our vendors.\nOn September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to the Buyer in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion.\nOn October 2, 2020, we redeemed of all of our outstanding 2021 Notes. We paid approximately $227.4 million to fully redeem all of the outstanding $224.25 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nOn January 17, 2017, we issued an aggregate of $86.3 million in principal amount of our Exchangeable Notes. Prior to the March 1, 2021 maturity of our Exchangeable Notes, holders elected to exchange for an aggregate of 10,144,131 shares of our common stock in satisfaction in full of the outstanding obligations under the Exchangeable Notes.\nAs of June 29, 2018, our Korean subsidiary entered into an arrangement whereby it (i) acquired a water treatment facility from SK hynix for $4.2 million to support our fabrication facility in Gumi, Korea, and (ii) subsequently sold the water treatment facility for $4.2 million to a third party management company that we engaged to run the facility for a 10-year\nterm beginning July 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding obligation of this arrangement is approximately $24.0 million for remaining service term through 2028.\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary were $273.6 million, which represents 98% of our total cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis. We currently believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves from cash on hand and expected cash from operations to fund our operations as well as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $279.5 million, which remained flat, compared to $279.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nCash inflow provided by operating activities totaled $87.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7.5 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects our net income of $56.7 million, as adjusted favorably by $65.5 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits, net foreign currency loss and stock-based compensation, and net unfavorable impact of $34.4 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2021 was $323.6 million compared to $236.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The $87.6 million increase was primarily attributable to the exchange of our Exchangeable Notes for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $318.5 million of cash inflow provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $349.9 million decrease in cash inflow was attributable to $350.6 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 in the third quarter of 2020, a $3.1 million net increase in hedge collateral, and a $1.6 million net increase in guarantee deposits, which was offset in part by a $3.9 million decrease in purchase of property, plant and equipment, and a $1.4 million increase in proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nCash outflow used in financing activities totaled $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $222.3 million of cash outflow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to a payment of $37.5 million for accelerated stock repurchase program and a payment of $1.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by $4.3 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a payment of $224.3 million for the full redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a payment of $1.1 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by $3.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options.\nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $32.2 million, a $3.9 million, or 10.8%, decrease from $36.1 million, including $5.8 million capital expenditures for discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were related to meeting our customer demand and supporting technology and facility improvement at our fabrication facilities.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $279.9 million, a $128.3 million increase compared to $151.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from a $318.5 million cash inflow provided by investing activities and a $7.5 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities, which were partially offset by a $222.3 million cash outflow used in financing activities.\nCash inflow provided by operating activities totaled $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $50.5 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects our net income of $57.8 million, excluding gain on sale of discontinued operations, as adjusted unfavorably by $17.4 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits, net foreign currency loss and deferred income tax assets, and net unfavorable impact of $33.0 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2020 was $236.0 million compared to $245.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to reclassification of the outstanding Exchangeable Notes, which were reclassified as a current liability in the first quarter of 2020, which was offset in part by increased cash and cash equivalents as a result of the completion of sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 and redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes.\nCash inflow provided by investing activities totaled $318.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $28.9 million of cash outflow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe $347.4 million increase in cash inflow was attributable to $350.6 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4, a $9.2 million net decrease in hedge collateral, which was offset in part by a $13.1 million increase in purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nCash outflow used in financing activities totaled $222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.8 million of cash outflow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a payment of $224.3 million for the full redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a payment of $1.1 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by $3.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a payment of $1.2 million for the repurchase of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in the first quarter of 2019 and a payment of $2.4 million for the repurchase of our common stock in January 2019 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan, which was offset in part by $2.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $36.1 million, a $13.1 million, or 57.3% increase from $23.0 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included certain one-time\ninvestments relating to separating shared IT infrastructure and R&D building upon the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. In addition, we routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capabilities. The routine capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were related to meeting customer demand, supporting technology and facility improvement at our fabrication facilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method ( FIFO\u201d). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors. Reserves are also established for excess inventory based on our current inventory levels and projected demand and our ability to sell those specific\nproducts. Situations that could cause these inventory reserves include a decline in business and economic conditions, decline in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decline in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and consumer requirements, or failure to estimate end customer demand properly. A reduction of these inventory reserves may be recorded if previously reserved items are subsequently sold as a result of unexpected changes to certain aforementioned situations.\nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $7.6 million, $7.3 million and $12.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $5.3 million, $4.3 million and $2.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs prescribed in ASC 330, Inventory,\u201d once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nWe make an ongoing assessment of our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, expiration of tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards and tax planning strategies. Then, if necessary, we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets in order for the net amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded only to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step\nprocess. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAlthough we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provisions for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_truncated": "Adjusted Operating Income is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Operating Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Operating Income, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Operating Income for the periods indicated as operating income adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (iii) expenses related to Fab 3 power outage, (iv) merger-related costs (income), net and (v) early termination and other charges.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nTotal\nrevenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nTotal\nrevenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales-standard products business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total standard products business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>465.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales-transitional Fab 3 foundry services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>507.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; \nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash\nequity-based compensation expenses.

year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $3.4 million non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi (which was closed during the year ended December 31, 2018), and $0.7 million legal settlement gain related to certain expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with our legacy Fab 4 (which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2020) and awarded in the third quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment primarily eliminates a $0.5 million legal settlement charge related to dispute with a prior customer and a legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee during the three months ended March 31, 2019. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method ( FIFO\u201d). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment primarily eliminates a $0.5 million legal settlement charge related to dispute with a prior customer and a legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee during the three months ended March 31, 2019. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as a measure of profitability of our business.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 27.3% compared to 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to inventory reserves related to certain legacy display products that were recorded in the first half of 2019 and an improved product mix, which was offset in part by an $1.5 million unexpected excess and obsolete inventory charge that we recorded in the second half of 2020 in relation to the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers. The delayed recovery of Fab 3 from the power outage, resulting in a lower than anticipated utilization rate, also negatively affected both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2020.\nOn December 21, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock and we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement\u201d) with JPM to repurchase an aggregate of $37.5 million of our common stock.\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by a $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nMerger-related costs.\nOur Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing, servers, automotive, and industrial applications.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our foreign exchange hedging activities.\n\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Business Transfer Agreement for the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to the Buyer. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale for a purchase price of approximately $350.6 million in cash.\n (g) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, this adjustment eliminates non-recurring professional service fees and expenses of $34.7 million and $0.7 million, incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $378.9 million and $686.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the outstanding intercompany loan balances including accrued interest was primarily attributable to our Korean subsidiary's repayment of certain loans by our Dutch subsidiary to fund the redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Business Transfer Agreement for the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $287.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. We have not incurred a gain or loss from discontinued operations in 2021 as the sale of the Foundry Service Group business and Fab 4 was completed in 2020.\nGross Profit.\nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce.

This increase continued until the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, impacted the shipment of certain mobile OLED display driver ICs to certain of our customers.\nPower Outage\nOn December 20, 2021, the Merger Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Termination Agreement after our receipt of a fee of $51.0 million from Parent and a new standby letter of credit, which secures a deferred fee of $19.2 million from Parent due on or before March 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\ncases could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of our customers and suppliers were to experience prolonged business shutdowns or other disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.4 million of non-recurring\nbased taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result.\nThe divestiture of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 was to strategically shift our operational focus to the standard products business. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Accordingly, we have one reportable segment: our standard products business, together with transitional foundry services associated with our fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as Fab 3, which we expect to perform for the Buyer up to September 1, 2023 (the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services\u201d).\nNet sales-standard products business in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased from $132.6 million to $106.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, or by $26.2 million, or 19.8%, primarily due to a strategic reduction of our lower margin non-auto\ntax assessments of $0.6 million as a result of a regular tax examination completed for our primary operating entity in Korea for multiple tax years, the grant timing of equity-based compensation, and increased depreciation and amortization expense, which was primarily attributable to certain one-time\nOLED wafers), as we outsource manufacturing of these products to external 12-inch\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which was offset in part by a $34.7 million of non-recurring\nexpenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) for a number of reasons, including:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $0.8 million of loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, which was attributable to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. In connection with the redemption of the 2021 Notes, we reclassified the remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on the redemption date as a loss on early extinguishment of borrowings.\nWe make an ongoing assessment of our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, expiration of tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards and tax planning strategies. Then, if necessary, we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets in order for the net amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded only to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nInterest Expense.\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nNet Income (Loss)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $52.4 million, or 11.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $50.0 million, or 9.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year increase of $2.5 million, or 4.9%, was primarily attributable to certain non-income-based\nengineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our display business are material and design-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving 28-nanometer\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $36.1 million, a $13.1 million, or 57.3% increase from $23.0 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included certain one-time\nwafer capacity, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED). We believe this balanced capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nWe recorded a $17.3 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily composed of the income tax expense of $6.9 million from our Korean subsidiary, primarily due to its taxable income for the year, and the income tax expense of $8.2 million from the parent entity in the U.S. The U.S. parent's tax expense was mainly attributable to the recognition of income and expenses related to the Merger combined with the utilization of its available net operating loss carry-forwards.\nAdjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis); for the periods indicated as income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, net, (v) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (vi) expenses related to Fab 3 power outage,\n (e) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $3.4 million non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi (which was closed during the year ended December 31, 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment primarily eliminates a $0.5 million legal settlement charge related to dispute with a prior customer and a legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee during the three months ended March 31, 2019. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $7.6 million, $7.3 million and $12.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $5.3 million, $4.3 million and $2.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n (j) For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments were calculated by calculating the tax expense of each jurisdiction with or without the non-GAAP adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary and the U.S parent entity were $2.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary was $0.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no tax impact from the adjustments to net income (loss) from continuing operations to calculate our Adjusted Net Income due to net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset taxable income and full allowance for deferred tax assets. \nOperating Expenses\nor finer processes. The majority of research and development expenses of our power business are certain equipment, material and design-related costs for power discrete products and material and design-related costs for power IC products. Power IC uses standard BCD process technologies which can be sourced from multiple foundries, including Fab 4.\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40\n\n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, this adjustment eliminates non-recurring professional service fees and expenses of $34.7 million and $0.7 million, incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nNet\nWe believe that all adjustments to income (loss) from continuing operations used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was applied consistently to the periods presented.\nfrom CFIUS to withdraw our joint filing.

We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\n (b) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nGAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, net, (v) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (vi) expenses related to Fab 3 power outage, (vii) merger-related costs (income), net and (viii) early termination and other charges, net. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense (income), net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $0.7 million of non-recurring\npandemic, such as new strains of the virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants and any\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Borrowings, Net.\nRecent sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products have resulted in a global shortage of manufacturing capacity. As a result, we may experience increased costs to manufacture our products and may not be able to manufacture and deliver all of the orders placed by our customers. Specifically, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacity from the external foundries we rely on, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, this shortage of manufacturing capacity may lead to an increase in our manufacturing costs which we may not be fully able to pass on to our customers. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by these persisting supply shortages, in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income of $56.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $345.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in U.S. dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash\nAdministrative\nWe primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nIncome from Continuing Operations\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $287.9 million compared to loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $289.3 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax primarily resulted from a $287.1 million increase in gain on sale of discontinued operations, a $10.8 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $9.2 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $7.6 million increase in gross profit due in part to depreciation and amortization associated with the assets classified as those held for sale having been ceased starting in the second quarter of 2020, which were offset in part by a $10.8 million increase in transaction costs, a $8.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $6.7 million increase in restructuring and other charges.\nPandemic\nDiscontinued Operations.\nAdditional details about the Rights Agreement are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based\n\nResearch and development expenses were $51.2 million, or 10.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $45.7 million, or 9.0%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates a reversal of such inventory charge as such reserved inventory was subsequently sold to certain other customers. As this charge and the timing of its reversal meaningfully impacted our operational results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense subject to our ability to foresee and control, we believe our operating performance results are more meaningfully compared if this charge and related reversal are excluded. \nof certain restrictions and containment measures, and may continue to lead to other restrictions being re-implemented\nOverview\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer and industrial products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we continually strive to diversify our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our worldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \nWe report net sales-standard products business by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales-standard products business by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales-standard products business represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur standard products business requires investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch\nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $32.2 million, a $3.9 million, or 10.8%, decrease from $36.1 million, including $5.8 million capital expenditures for discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were related to meeting our customer demand and supporting technology and facility improvement at our fabrication facilities.\nPrior to the March 1, 2021 maturity of our Exchangeable Notes, holders thereof elected to exchange the Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate of 10,144,131 shares of our common stock in satisfaction in full of the outstanding obligations under the Exchangeable Notes. On March 1, 2021, we paid the final interest payment on the Exchangeable Notes of $2.1 million and no longer have any Exchangeable Notes obligations outstanding as of such date.\n\nExplanation and Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP\n\nAdjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) as a further supplemental measure of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) by adjusting income (loss) from continuing operations to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash\nWe encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is as follows:\nOur interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes. We redeemed all outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Our Exchangeable Notes were exchanged for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021. From and after October 2, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we have not incurred interest expense associated with the 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes, respectively.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2021 was $323.6 million compared to $236.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The $87.6 million increase was primarily attributable to the exchange of our Exchangeable Notes for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nNet sales from our standard products business were $433.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $32.4 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a continuing severe global shortage in manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nDDIC business.\nThe standard products business.\nOn September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to the Buyer in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion.\nOperating Income\nAccelerated Stock Repurchase Program\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nThe rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring\ntranslation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nEarly Termination and Other Charges.\nGeneral\nfoundry starting in the second half of 2015 and we have started outsourcing 8-inch\nWe continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of the COVID-19\nMeasures\nIncome Taxes.\nWe are not able to foresee when the current shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside. A prolonged global supply shortage could negatively impact our financial condition, potentially resulting in a need for additional capital to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities.\nOn September 1, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to Key Foundry Co., Ltd. (the Buyer\u201d) in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion. In addition to the purchase price, the Buyer assumed all severance liabilities relating to the transferred employees, which had a value of approximately $100 million.\nWe record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end\nadjustments.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\n\nThe Terminated Merger\n\n (i) This adjustment eliminates the impact of difference between GAAP and cash tax expense. \nOn October 16, 2020, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the Program\u201d), which was available for all employees. In connection with the Program, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $4.4 million of termination related charges within early termination and other charges, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $0.8 million in expenses related to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment eliminates expenses related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in the first quarter of 2019. \ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million and $378.9 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $3.8 million income tax expenses, primarily attributable to interest on intercompany loan balances, which was offset in part by an income tax benefit of $1.7 million, resulting in a net income tax expense of $2.2 million. The income tax benefit of $1.7 million was due to the application of the exception rule under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d) in connection with the intra-period allocation, which resulted in tax benefits in our continuing operations and tax expenses in the discontinued operations for an equal and offsetting amount for the presentation purposes only.\nOn October 2, 2020, we redeemed of all of our outstanding 2021 Notes. We paid approximately $227.4 million to fully redeem all of the outstanding $224.25 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nSince 2007, we had designed and manufactured OLED display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities.

In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\nDepreciation Expense.\nResults by business line\nWe experienced some minor disruption in our Power Solutions business from assembly and test subcontractors located in China in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\nGross Profit\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $80, subject to adjustment (the Purchase Price\u201d).

The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a payment of $224.3 million for the full redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a payment of $1.1 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by $3.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a payment of $1.2 million for the repurchase of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in the first quarter of 2019 and a payment of $2.4 million for the repurchase of our common stock in January 2019 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan, which was offset in part by $2.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nprocess. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nTFTs).

The net foreign currency losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were due to the depreciation in the value of the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar during each period.\nWe present Adjusted Operating Income as supplemental measures of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Operating Income by adjusting operating income to eliminate the impact of equity-based compensation expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance.

We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provisions for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method ( FIFO\u201d).

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 27.3% compared to 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to inventory reserves related to certain legacy display products that were recorded in the first half of 2019 and an improved product mix, which was offset in part by an $1.5 million unexpected excess and obsolete inventory charge that we recorded in the second half of 2020 in relation to the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers. The delayed recovery of Fab 3 from the power outage, resulting in a lower than anticipated utilization rate, also negatively affected both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2020.\nOn December 21, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock and we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement\u201d) with JPM to repurchase an aggregate of $37.5 million of our common stock.\nprofessional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by a $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nMerger-related costs.\nOur Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing, servers, automotive, and industrial applications.

As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale for a purchase price of approximately $350.6 million in cash.\n (g) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, this adjustment eliminates non-recurring professional service fees and expenses of $34.7 million and $0.7 million, incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $378.9 million and $686.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the outstanding intercompany loan balances including accrued interest was primarily attributable to our Korean subsidiary's repayment of certain loans by our Dutch subsidiary to fund the redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nOn March 30, 2020, we entered into the Business Transfer Agreement for the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from our continuing operations for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $287.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. We have not incurred a gain or loss from discontinued operations in 2021 as the sale of the Foundry Service Group business and Fab 4 was completed in 2020.\nGross Profit.\nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce.

This increase continued until the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, impacted the shipment of certain mobile OLED display driver ICs to certain of our customers.\nPower Outage\nOn December 20, 2021, the Merger Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Termination Agreement after our receipt of a fee of $51.0 million from Parent and a new standby letter of credit, which secures a deferred fee of $19.2 million from Parent due on or before March 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\ncases could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of our customers and suppliers were to experience prolonged business shutdowns or other disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.4 million of non-recurring\nbased taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result.\nThe divestiture of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 was to strategically shift our operational focus to the standard products business. As a result, the results of the Foundry Services Group business were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Accordingly, we have one reportable segment: our standard products business, together with transitional foundry services associated with our fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as Fab 3, which we expect to perform for the Buyer up to September 1, 2023 (the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services\u201d).\nNet sales-standard products business in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased from $132.6 million to $106.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, or by $26.2 million, or 19.8%, primarily due to a strategic reduction of our lower margin non-auto\ntax assessments of $0.6 million as a result of a regular tax examination completed for our primary operating entity in Korea for multiple tax years, the grant timing of equity-based compensation, and increased depreciation and amortization expense, which was primarily attributable to certain one-time\nOLED wafers), as we outsource manufacturing of these products to external 12-inch\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which was offset in part by a $34.7 million of non-recurring\nexpenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) for a number of reasons, including:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $0.8 million of loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, which was attributable to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. In connection with the redemption of the 2021 Notes, we reclassified the remaining unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on the redemption date as a loss on early extinguishment of borrowings.\nWe make an ongoing assessment of our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, expiration of tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards and tax planning strategies. Then, if necessary, we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets in order for the net amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded only to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nInterest Expense.\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nNet Income (Loss)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $52.4 million, or 11.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $50.0 million, or 9.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year increase of $2.5 million, or 4.9%, was primarily attributable to certain non-income-based\nengineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our display business are material and design-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving 28-nanometer\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $36.1 million, a $13.1 million, or 57.3% increase from $23.0 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included certain one-time\nwafer capacity, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED). We believe this balanced capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nWe recorded a $17.3 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily composed of the income tax expense of $6.9 million from our Korean subsidiary, primarily due to its taxable income for the year, and the income tax expense of $8.2 million from the parent entity in the U.S. The U.S. parent's tax expense was mainly attributable to the recognition of income and expenses related to the Merger combined with the utilization of its available net operating loss carry-forwards.\nAdjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis); for the periods indicated as income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) loss on early extinguishment of borrowings, net, (v) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (vi) expenses related to Fab 3 power outage,\n (e) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $3.4 million non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by $1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi (which was closed during the year ended December 31, 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $4.4 million of charges related to the reduction of workforce under the Program and $0.6 million of non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain treasury and finance initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment primarily eliminates a $0.5 million legal settlement charge related to dispute with a prior customer and a legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee during the three months ended March 31, 2019. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $7.6 million, $7.3 million and $12.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $5.3 million, $4.3 million and $2.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n (j) For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments were calculated by calculating the tax expense of each jurisdiction with or without the non-GAAP adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary and the U.S parent entity were $2.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary was $0.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no tax impact from the adjustments to net income (loss) from continuing operations to calculate our Adjusted Net Income due to net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset taxable income and full allowance for deferred tax assets. \nOperating Expenses\nor finer processes. The majority of research and development expenses of our power business are certain equipment, material and design-related costs for power discrete products and material and design-related costs for power IC products. Power IC uses standard BCD process technologies which can be sourced from multiple foundries, including Fab 4.\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40\n\n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates $70.2 million income from the recognition of termination fee from the Parent as a result of the termination of the merger transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, this adjustment eliminates non-recurring professional service fees and expenses of $34.7 million and $0.7 million, incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. \nNet\nWe believe that all adjustments to income (loss) from continuing operations used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was applied consistently to the periods presented.\nfrom CFIUS to withdraw our joint filing.

We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\n (b) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nGAAP measure.

As a result, we may experience increased costs to manufacture our products and may not be able to manufacture and deliver all of the orders placed by our customers. Specifically, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacity from the external foundries we rely on, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, this shortage of manufacturing capacity may lead to an increase in our manufacturing costs which we may not be fully able to pass on to our customers. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by these persisting supply shortages, in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nNet Sales-Standard Products Business by Geographic Region\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income of $56.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $345.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in U.S. dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash\nAdministrative\nWe primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand.

Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nIncome from Continuing Operations\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $287.9 million compared to loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $289.3 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax primarily resulted from a $287.1 million increase in gain on sale of discontinued operations, a $10.8 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $9.2 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $7.6 million increase in gross profit due in part to depreciation and amortization associated with the assets classified as those held for sale having been ceased starting in the second quarter of 2020, which were offset in part by a $10.8 million increase in transaction costs, a $8.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $6.7 million increase in restructuring and other charges.\nPandemic\nDiscontinued Operations.\nAdditional details about the Rights Agreement are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based\n\nResearch and development expenses were $51.2 million, or 10.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $45.7 million, or 9.0%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates a reversal of such inventory charge as such reserved inventory was subsequently sold to certain other customers. As this charge and the timing of its reversal meaningfully impacted our operational results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense subject to our ability to foresee and control, we believe our operating performance results are more meaningfully compared if this charge and related reversal are excluded. \nof certain restrictions and containment measures, and may continue to lead to other restrictions being re-implemented\nOverview\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer and industrial products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we continually strive to diversify our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our worldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \nWe report net sales-standard products business by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales-standard products business by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales-standard products business represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur standard products business requires investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch\nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $32.2 million, a $3.9 million, or 10.8%, decrease from $36.1 million, including $5.8 million capital expenditures for discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were related to meeting our customer demand and supporting technology and facility improvement at our fabrication facilities.\nPrior to the March 1, 2021 maturity of our Exchangeable Notes, holders thereof elected to exchange the Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate of 10,144,131 shares of our common stock in satisfaction in full of the outstanding obligations under the Exchangeable Notes. On March 1, 2021, we paid the final interest payment on the Exchangeable Notes of $2.1 million and no longer have any Exchangeable Notes obligations outstanding as of such date.\n\nExplanation and Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP\n\nAdjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) as a further supplemental measure of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) by adjusting income (loss) from continuing operations to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash\nWe encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is as follows:\nOur interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes. We redeemed all outstanding 2021 Notes on October 2, 2020. Our Exchangeable Notes were exchanged for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021. From and after October 2, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we have not incurred interest expense associated with the 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes, respectively.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2021 was $323.6 million compared to $236.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The $87.6 million increase was primarily attributable to the exchange of our Exchangeable Notes for common stock prior to their maturity date of March 1, 2021.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nNet sales from our standard products business were $433.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $32.4 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $465.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a continuing severe global shortage in manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch\nDDIC business.\nThe standard products business.\nOn September 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to the Buyer in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion.\nOperating Income\nAccelerated Stock Repurchase Program\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nThe rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring\ntranslation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nEarly Termination and Other Charges.\nGeneral\nfoundry starting in the second half of 2015 and we have started outsourcing 8-inch\nWe continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of the COVID-19\nMeasures\nIncome Taxes.\nWe are not able to foresee when the current shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside. A prolonged global supply shortage could negatively impact our financial condition, potentially resulting in a need for additional capital to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities.\nOn September 1, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we completed the sale of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 to Key Foundry Co., Ltd. (the Buyer\u201d) in exchange for a purchase price equal to approximately $350.6 million in cash. The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of $46.5 million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW 360.6 billion. In addition to the purchase price, the Buyer assumed all severance liabilities relating to the transferred employees, which had a value of approximately $100 million.\nWe record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end\nadjustments.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\n\nThe Terminated Merger\n\n (i) This adjustment eliminates the impact of difference between GAAP and cash tax expense. \nOn October 16, 2020, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the Program\u201d), which was available for all employees. In connection with the Program, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $4.4 million of termination related charges within early termination and other charges, net\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2020, this adjustment eliminates $0.8 million in expenses related to the full redemption of our outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this adjustment eliminates expenses related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in the first quarter of 2019. \ntranslation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $344.4 million and $378.9 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $3.8 million income tax expenses, primarily attributable to interest on intercompany loan balances, which was offset in part by an income tax benefit of $1.7 million, resulting in a net income tax expense of $2.2 million. The income tax benefit of $1.7 million was due to the application of the exception rule under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d) in connection with the intra-period allocation, which resulted in tax benefits in our continuing operations and tax expenses in the discontinued operations for an equal and offsetting amount for the presentation purposes only.\nOn October 2, 2020, we redeemed of all of our outstanding 2021 Notes. We paid approximately $227.4 million to fully redeem all of the outstanding $224.25 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nSince 2007, we had designed and manufactured OLED display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to an external 12-inch\nAs prescribed in ASC 330, Inventory,\u201d once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\nDepreciation Expense.\nResults by business line\nWe experienced some minor disruption in our Power Solutions business from assembly and test subcontractors located in China in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\nGross Profit\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $80, subject to adjustment (the Purchase Price\u201d).

The Board of Directors may redeem all of the Rights for $0.001 per Right at any time before any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person. In addition, at any time on or after any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person (but before any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes the owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock), the Board of Directors may exchange all or part of the Rights (other than the Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right. The Rights will expire at the close of business on December 12, 2022, unless redeemed or exchanged prior to that time.\nForeign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries' functional currency are included in foreign currency gain (loss), net in our statements of operations. A substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non-cash\nWe report net sales-standard products business by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates a reversal of such inventory charge as such reserved inventory was subsequently sold to certain other customers. As this charge and the timing of its reversal meaningfully impacted our operational results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense subject to our ability to foresee and control, we believe our operating performance results are more meaningfully compared if this charge and related reversal are excluded. \nExpenses.\n (c) This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged.

The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a payment of $224.3 million for the full redemption of the outstanding 2021 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a payment of $1.1 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by $3.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a payment of $1.2 million for the repurchase of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in the first quarter of 2019 and a payment of $2.4 million for the repurchase of our common stock in January 2019 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan, which was offset in part by $2.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nprocess. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recorded a $46.2 million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of releasing valuation allowances established against the related deferred tax assets related to our Korean subsidiary and the parent entity in the U.S. Our Korean subsidiary had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and is anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, $39.4 million of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary's deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we believe it is more likely than not that the parent entity in the U.S. would be able to utilize its net operating loss in future tax years, which would provide incremental tax savings of approximately $4.5 million. Therefore, we released the valuation allowances, established against the U.S. parent's deferred tax assets, up to these anticipated tax savings as of December 31, 2020.\nTFTs).

The net foreign currency losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were due to the depreciation in the value of the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar during each period.\nWe present Adjusted Operating Income as supplemental measures of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Operating Income by adjusting operating income to eliminate the impact of equity-based compensation expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Operating Income is useful to investors to provide a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\n(vii) merger-related costs (income), net, (viii) early termination and other charges, net, (ix) GAAP and cash tax expense difference and (x) income tax effect on non-GAAP\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income of $345.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As discussed above, the increase in net income of $366.8 million primarily resulted from a $289.3 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, mainly attributable to the completion of the sale of the Foundry Service Group business and Fab 4, and a $77.5 million improvement in loss from continuing operations.\nOur Display Solutions line of products provide flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small flat panel displays.

We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in U.S. dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. \n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nThe semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products.

report:\n\nOverview\n- Magnachip is a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for communications, consumer, industrial, and automotive applications. It has over 40 years of operating history.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Total revenues for 2021 were $474.2 million, down 6.5% compared to 2020, primarily driven by decreases in the Display Solutions business due to manufacturing capacity shortages, offset somewhat by increases in the Power Solutions business. \n- Net income for 2021 was $56.7 million compared to $345.0 million in 2020. 2020 net income was higher mainly due to a one-time $287.9 million gain from the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4.\n\nAdjusted Financial Metrics \n- The report presents non-GAAP adjusted financial metrics like Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income to evaluate the company's core operating performance by eliminating one-time or non-cash items.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash from operations was $87.7 million in 2021 compared to $7.5 million in 2020, reflecting higher net income adjusted for non-cash items in 2021.  \n- The company redeemed senior notes in 2020, helping drive interest expenses significantly lower in 2021.\n- The company has sufficient cash reserves to fund operations and capex for the next twelve months.\n\nThat's a high-level summary covering some of the key operating performance and financial results discussed in the report.
