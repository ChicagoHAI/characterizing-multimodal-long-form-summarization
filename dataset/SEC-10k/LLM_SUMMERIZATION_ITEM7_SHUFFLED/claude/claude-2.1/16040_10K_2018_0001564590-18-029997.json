This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nShipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Taxes collected on sales to customers are excluded from revenues.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of our reportable segments:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of products in our Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Purification Solutions segments. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer cash discounts and volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. We periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly.\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of the rental process and from the sale of fine cesium chemicals. This revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product.\nInventory Valuation\nEffective October 1, 2017, we changed our method of accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. Total U.S. inventories accounted for utilizing the LIFO cost flow assumption represented 7% of total worldwide inventories as of September 30, 2017 prior to this change in method. We believe the FIFO method is preferable because it: (i) conforms the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories to the inventory valuation methodology for the majority of our other inventories; (ii) better represents how management assesses and reports on the performance of the Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals operating segments that carry U.S. carbon black inventories, as the impact of accounting for this inventory on a LIFO basis has historically been excluded from segment results; (iii) better aligns the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories with the physical flow of that inventory; and (iv) improves comparability with many of our peers. We applied this change retrospectively to all prior periods presented for which details are presented under the heading Inventories\u201d in Note A. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories that are classified as inventory and assets held for rent is determined using the average cost method. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the FIFO method.\nWe periodically review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory, and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. As discussed in Note C of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we acquired Tech Blend in November 2017, and the purchase price allocation included separately identifiable intangible assets of $29 million.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised of trademarks, customer relationships and developed technologies, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. We recognized an impairment on intangible assets associated with the Purification Solutions business in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, which is discussed in detail below under the heading Purifications Solutions Goodwill and Long-lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\nGoodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Reinforcement Materials, and the Fumed Metal Oxides and Specialty Compounds businesses within Performance Chemicals, which are considered separate reporting units, carried our Goodwill balances as of May 31, 2018. The Purification Solutions reporting unit has no remaining goodwill balance subsequent to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As part of the Tech Blend acquisition, goodwill of $33 million was generated and is reflected in the Specialty Compounds reporting unit.\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment loss would result. The goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Refer to the discussion under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d for details on the Purification Solutions goodwill impairment test and the resulting charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and refer to Note G of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the results of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018.\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nTo test for impairment of assets, we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that the long-lived asset group of Purification Solutions was not recoverable and accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge for the carrying value in excess of the fair value of the asset group, as described below under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Purification Solutions reporting unit experienced further share losses, lower customer demand and declining prices in the mercury removal and North America powdered activated carbon applications, which led us to reassess our previous estimates for expected growth in volumes, prices and margins in the reporting unit. The forecasted demand and profit margins in mercury removal applications were lowered reflecting further unit closures at coal-fired utility plants, lower usage levels of activated carbon and lower plant utilization levels for coal-fired utilities, as well as lower pricing due to industry overcapacity, among other factors. While development programs continue to progress, growth estimates in other environmental and specialty applications were also lowered, reflecting heightened competition and updated timelines to commercialize certain new products. Due to these revised forecasts, we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $92 million.\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including growth rates in environmental and specialty applications and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit.\nPrior to determining the goodwill impairment charge, we considered whether the assets of the reporting unit, which is also considered the asset group, were recoverable. As a result of this assessment, we recorded an inventory reserve adjustment of $13 million and impairments to long lived assets of $162 million. The adjustment to inventory carrying value was determined based on reassessments of volumes, pricing, and margins described above and was recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable was based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $64 million and $98 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets.\nWe used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and the cost approach to determine the fair value of our property, plant and equipment. We will continue to monitor for events or changes in business circumstances that may indicate that the remaining carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable.\nWe recorded a tax benefit related to the impairment charges of $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 which was subsequently reduced by $1 million after the impairment charges by tax jurisdiction were finalized.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nIncome Taxes\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to federal income tax law affecting us. Refer to the discussion under the heading Tax Reform\u201d in Note R of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Note R\u201d).\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdditionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nWe have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in Note A in Item 8 below. Certain of these policies include the use of estimates, but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure. However, these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to the discussion in Note B of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\nThe term product mix\u201d refers to the mix of types and grades of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business and/or segment.\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings from affiliated companies less certain items and other unallocated items. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of our operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the business segments and primarily benefit corporate objectives, are not allocated to our business segments, such as interest expense and other corporate costs, which include unallocated corporate overhead expenses such as certain corporate salaries and headquarter expenses, plus costs related to special projects and initiatives, which we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d. Management believes excluding the items identified as certain items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis and also facilitates an evaluation of our operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits. The items of income and expense that we have excluded from Total segment EBIT, as applicable, but that are included in our GAAP Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, as applicable, are described below.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset impairment charges, which primarily include charges associated with an impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Global restructuring activities include costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures, which primarily relate to (i) employee termination costs, (ii) asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions, (iii) costs to close facilities, including environmental costs and contract termination penalties and (iv) gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Inventory reserve adjustment, which resulted from an evaluation performed as part of an impairment analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquisition and integration-related charges, which include transaction costs, redundant costs incurred during the period of integration, and costs associated with transitioning certain management and business processes to our processes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Legal and environmental reserves and matters, which consist of costs or benefits for matters typically related to former businesses or that are otherwise incurred outside of the ordinary course of business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gains (losses) on sale of investments, which primarily relate to the sale of investments accounted for using the cost method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-recurring gains (losses) on foreign exchange, which primarily relate to the impact of controlled currency devaluations on our net monetary assets denominated in that currency.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Executive transition costs, which include incremental charges, including stock compensation charges, associated with the retirement or termination of employment of senior executives of the Company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Employee benefit plan settlement charges, which consist of the costs associated with transferring the obligations and assets held by one of our defined benefit plans to a multi-employer plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDrivers of Demand and Key Factors Affecting Profitability\nDrivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment. In Reinforcement Materials, longer term demand is driven primarily by: i) the number of vehicle miles driven globally; ii) the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced; and iii) the number of automotive builds. Over the past several years, operating results have been driven by a number of factors, including: i) increases or decreases in our sales volumes driven by changes in production levels for tires or industrial rubber products and the level at which we service that demand; ii) changes in raw material costs and our ability to adjust the sales price for our products commensurate with changes in raw material costs; iii) changes in pricing and product mix, which includes customer pricing as well as the mix of products sold or the region in which they are sold; iv) global and regional capacity utilization for carbon black; v) fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities; vi) the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies; vii) capacity management and technology investments, including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities; and viii) royalties and technology payments related to our patented elastomer composites technology that is used in tire applications.\nIn Performance Chemicals, longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. In recent years, operating results in Performance Chemicals have been driven by: i) increases or decreases in sales volumes to the industries previously noted; ii) our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers' applications; iii) our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation; iv) the cost of new capacity; v) changes in selling prices relative to variations in the cost of raw materials; and vi) the adoption of new products for use in our customers' applications.\nIn Purification Solutions, longer term demand is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon based solutions for water, gas and air, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, catalysts and other chemical applications. Operating results in Purification Solutions have been influenced by: i) changes in our sales volumes in the various applications previously noted; ii) the amount of coal-based power generation utilized in the U.S. and the regulation of those utilities; iii) management of our operations, including inventory levels, and the commensurate costs; iv) changes in price and product mix; and v) industry capacity utilization.\nIn Specialty Fluids, longer term demand is primarily driven by: i) the level of drilling activity utilizing cesium formate for high pressure oil and gas wells; ii) the petroleum industry's acceptance of cesium formate as a drilling and completion fluid for this application; and iii) continued use of fine cesium chemicals in a variety of applications. Operating results in Specialty Fluids are influenced by the number of drilling projects as well as the size, type and duration of those drilling jobs and demand for fine cesium chemicals.\nOverview of Results for Fiscal 2018\nDuring fiscal 2018, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the Purification Solutions goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-Consolidated\nNet Sales and Other Operating Revenues and Gross Profit\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales and other operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $525 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $323 million), higher volumes ($110 million) and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation ($83 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher spot pricing in Asia and higher selling prices related to calendar year 2018 tire customer agreements. The $306 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $248 million), an increase in volumes ($77 million), partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($24 million). The favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to higher selling prices during the year from price adjustments to customers for increases in raw materials costs.\nGross profit increased by $118 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by higher volumes and unit margins in Reinforcement Materials, partially offset by higher fixed costs.

Although the passage of the Act reduced the U.S. tax rate and effectively created a participation exemption regime, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by certain other aspects of the new legislation, including in particular, immediate U.S. taxation of global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries. In transitioning to this new full participation exemption regime for foreign earnings, we are also subject to a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings.

Total segment EBIT increased by $71 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in Total segment EBIT was driven by higher unit margins ($73 million), higher volumes ($53 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($20 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($64 million). The increase in margins and volumes was driven by Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. The increase in fixed costs in fiscal 2018 was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\nIn fiscal 2017, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased by $108 million and Total segment EBIT increased by $39 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increases were primarily driven by higher volumes across all segments except Specialty Fluids ($43 million), higher unit margins in Reinforcement Materials ($62 million), and a favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($23 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($49 million), and lower unit margins in Performance Chemicals ($33 million).\nCertain Items:\nDetails of the certain items for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets of Purification\nSolutions (Note F)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global restructuring activities (Note O)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal and environmental matters and reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory reserve adjustment (Note D)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains (losses) on sale of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition and integration-related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Executive transition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recurring gain (loss) on foreign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other certain items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total certain items, pre-tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (248\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax-related certain items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax impact of certain items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discrete tax items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (148\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tax-related certain items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total certain items, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (365\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn explanation of these items of expense and income is included in our discussion under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.

The balances of unallocated corporate costs are primarily comprised of expenditures related to managing a public company that are not allocated to the segments and corporate business development costs related to ongoing corporate projects. The balances of General unallocated income (expense) consists of gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions, net of other foreign currency risk management activities, interest income, dividend income, the profit or loss related to the corporate adjustment for unearned revenue, and the impact of including the full operating results of a contractual joint venture in Purification Solutions Segment EBIT.\nIn fiscal 2018, Total other unallocated items changed by $8 million when compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by a change of $11 million in Unallocated corporate costs and a change of $1 million in General unallocated income, partially offset by a change of $5 million in Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax. The change in Unallocated corporate costs was primarily due to corporate project spending and higher incentive compensation.\nIn fiscal 2017, Total other unallocated items changed by $9 million when compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by a change of $4 million of Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax, due to lower earnings from our Venezuelan equity affiliate. In addition, Unallocated corporate costs changed by $5 million primarily associated with higher expenses related to incentive compensation.\nReinforcement Materials\nSales and EBIT for Reinforcement Materials for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $393 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $307 million), higher volumes ($44 million) and a favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($42 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher pricing from 2018 tire customer agreements, higher spot pricing in Asia, and the passthrough of higher feedstock costs in our pricing. Higher volumes were driven by higher demand in the Americas and Europe.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $273 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $260 million) and higher volumes ($27 million), partially offset by the unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($12 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily driven by benefits from higher prices in our tire customer agreements and spot pricing in addition to a more favorable regional mix. Higher volumes were driven by an increase in rubber blacks volumes from higher contractual volumes in the Americas.\nIn fiscal 2018, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $86 million when compared to fiscal 2017 driven principally by higher unit margins ($89 million), higher volumes ($19 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($13 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($33 million). Higher unit margins were driven primarily by 2018 contract gains and a favorable spot market in Asia. The higher volumes were primarily due to higher demand in the Americas and Europe. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iii) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\nIn fiscal 2017, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $56 million when compared to fiscal 2016 driven principally by higher rubber blacks unit margins ($62 million), higher rubber blacks volumes ($13 million) and the favorable impact from a change in inventory levels ($6 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($21 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The favorable unit margins were due to benefits from customer agreement pricing gains and spot pricing as well as a more favorable regional mix, with higher sales in North America and lower sales in Asia. Higher rubber blacks fixed costs were primarily associated with the timing of required maintenance costs.\nPerformance Chemicals\nSales and EBIT for Performance Chemicals for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Carbons and Formulations Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metal Oxides Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $120 million when compared to fiscal 2017 due to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $36 million), higher volumes ($52 million) and the favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($33 million). The higher volumes were driven by the acquisition of Tech Blend, which led to higher volumes in the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business. The more favorable price and product mix is primarily due to improved mix and price increases in excess of rising feedstock costs within the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $43 million when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher volumes across all product lines ($51 million) and a favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million), partially offset by an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($11 million). The higher volumes were mainly driven by growth in sales in Asia and North America.\nIn fiscal 2018, EBIT in Performance Chemicals was $1 million lower than in fiscal 2017. Higher volumes ($21 million), higher unit margins ($13 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($8 million) were fully offset by higher fixed costs ($42 million) and the unfavorable impact from inventory changes ($1 million). Unit margins improved in fiscal 2018 due to successfully implementing price increases in excess of higher feedstock costs. Higher volumes were primarily due to growth in Specialty Compounds which includes the acquisition of Tech Blend during fiscal 2018. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\nIn fiscal 2017, EBIT in Performance Chemicals decreased by $24 million when compared to fiscal 2016 due to lower unit margins ($33 million), higher fixed costs ($23 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The decrease in unit margins was driven by higher raw material costs. Higher fixed costs were a result of increased maintenance, higher activity levels and growth investments. These decreases in EBIT were partially offset by higher volumes ($32 million) and the favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($2 million). The increase in volumes were primarily driven by growth across all Performance Chemicals product lines during fiscal 2017 with increases in volumes from Asia, North America and Europe.\nPurification Solutions\nSales and EBIT for Purification Solutions for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $2 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower volumes ($9 million) and a less favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($9 million). The lower volumes were due to increased competition, customer curtailments and reduced usage in the mercury removal application.\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $9 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $16 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($8 million). The less favorable price and product mix was primarily due to price competition in North America for powder activated carbon and weaker mix in specialty applications. The increase in volumes during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to volume growth within mercury removal and specialty applications.\nEBIT in Purification Solutions decreased by $13 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by lower unit margins ($11 million), lower volumes ($5 million), the unfavorable impact of changing inventory levels ($7 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by lower fixed costs ($12 million). Lower margins were due to increased competitive intensity in mercury removal and other North American powdered activated carbon applications. Lower fixed costs were due to the savings associated with restructuring actions put in effect during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the lower depreciation and amortization expense from recording an impairment during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note F.\nEBIT in Purification Solutions increased by $11 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 driven by the favorable impact of changing inventory levels ($15 million), higher volumes ($5 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). These improvements were partially offset by lower unit margins ($5 million) and higher fixed costs ($6 million). Higher volumes were due to sales to mercury removal and specialty customers. Higher fixed costs were a result of a plant disruption during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and investment in research and development, marketing and sales resources as we focus on growing the specialty portion of the portfolio.\nSpecialty Fluids\nSales and EBIT for Specialty Fluids for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in Specialty Fluids increased by $4 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of project activity that resulted in higher rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids.\nSales in Specialty Fluids decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($9 million) from lower project activity levels that resulted in lower rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids. The decrease in volumes was partially offset by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million).\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher fixed costs ($1 million).\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $4 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($6 million), which was partially offset by an improved price and product mix ($2 million).\nOutlook\nLooking forward to fiscal 2019, we believe favorable industry dynamics and Cabot's leadership positions will enable another year of strong growth. There are some near term uncertainties, largely related to trade tariffs between the U.S. and China, volatile commodity prices and new emission testing standards in Europe that are causing disruptions in auto production. These uncertainties are driving certain customers to be cautious in their short-term purchasing behavior, but we do not expect this to have a long-term impact on the business. We continue to expect EBIT growth across all segments in fiscal 2019. Reinforcement Materials is expected to benefit from favorable calendar 2019 customer agreements and our strong market position in Asia. We anticipate that Performance Chemicals EBIT will improve as we move through the year and we begin to see the anticipated benefits of our recent growth investments in the second half of fiscal 2019. We expect that Purification Solutions will benefit from a targeted improvement plan we are implementing to focus our portfolio, optimize our assets and streamline the organizational structure to support the new focus. In addition, we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our Purification Solutions business. We anticipate that Specialty Fluids will continue its recent strong performance into fiscal 2019.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nOverview\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability, decreased by $354 million during fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased commercial paper borrowings, which reduced our borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, and a decrease in our cash balances. As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175 million and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement of $751 million. Our revolving credit agreement, which was amended in October 2017 to extend the maturity to October 2022, supports our commercial paper program and may be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.\nAt September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our revolving credit facility including the total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenant.\nA significant portion of our business occurs outside the U.S. and our cash generation does not always align geographically with our cash needs. The vast majority of our cash and cash equivalent holdings tend to be held outside the U.S. Cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future investments. We use commercial paper throughout the year to manage short term U.S. cash needs. The commercial paper balance is generally reduced at quarter-end using cash derived from customer collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. The balance of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2018 was $249 million. If additional funds are needed in the U.S., we can repatriate offshore earnings.\nWe generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital requirements as needed by region or site. Cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities, except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non-functional currency or debt.\nWe anticipate sufficient liquidity from (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flows from operating activities; and (iii) cash available from our revolving credit agreement and our commercial paper program to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. The liquidity we derive from cash flows from operations is, to a large degree, predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner, the cost of our raw materials, and our ability to manage inventory levels.\nWe issued $30 million of 7.42% medium term notes in fiscal 1999 that mature on December 11, 2018 and are included in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018. We intend to pay off these notes at maturity with cash on hand and/or commercial paper borrowings.\nIn November 2013, we purchased all of our joint venture partner's common stock in the former NHUMO, S.A. de C.V. ( NHUMO\u201d) joint venture. At the close of the transaction, NHUMO issued redeemable preferred stock to the joint venture partner with a repurchase value of $25 million and a fixed dividend rate of 6% per annum. In November 2018, we repurchased the preferred stock for $25 million and paid a final dividend payment of approximately $1.4 million.\nThe following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, which consists of net income adjusted for the various non-cash items included in income, changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts, totaled $298 million in fiscal 2018. Operating activities provided $348 million and $392 million in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2016, respectively.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by net income, which, before non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, totaled $329 million from strong business performance and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in Accounts and notes receivable and Inventories largely driven by higher raw material costs.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by net income of $273 million plus $155 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was an increase in accounts payable and accruals and dividends from equity affiliates. These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to higher sales and raw material costs.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by net income of $162 million plus $161 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories largely driven by lower raw material costs and associated price reductions. These sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, the following other elements of operations have a bearing on operating cash flows:\nRestructurings - As of September 30, 2018, we had $5 million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to our global restructuring activities. We made cash payments of $5 million during fiscal 2018 and received cash payments of $39 million related to the sale of land at our former sites in Thane, India and Merak, Indonesia. In fiscal 2019 and thereafter, we expect to make cash payments totaling approximately $5 million related to these restructuring plans.\nEnvironmental Reserves and Litigation Matters-As of September 30, 2018, we had a $15 million reserve for environmental remediation costs at various sites. These sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018, we had a $25 million reserve for respirator claims. Expenditures for each of these reserves will be incurred over many years. We also have other litigation costs arising in the ordinary course of business.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn fiscal 2018, investing activities consumed $246 million, which was primarily driven by $64 million of cash paid for our Specialty Compounds acquisition of Tech Blend, net of cash acquired of $1 million, and capital expenditures of $229 million. These capital expenditures were for sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Offsetting these amounts was an inflow of cash related to the sales of land at our former sites in Merak, Indonesia, and Thane, India and proceeds from the sale of shares of a cost method investment in Asia. In fiscal 2017, capital expenditures were $147 million. Capital expenditures were primarily related to sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities. In fiscal 2016, capital expenditures were $112 million. Major capital project expenditures were related to sustaining and compliance activities.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. Our planned capital spending program for fiscal 2019 is primarily for sustaining, compliance and improvement capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFinancing activities consumed $141 million of cash in fiscal 2018 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2017 and $184 million in fiscal 2016. The use of cash in fiscal 2018 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $80 million, purchases of common stock of $142 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $21 million. This was offset by an increase in our overall debt balance of $80 million. The increase in debt was driven primarily by an increase in working capital and the acquisition of Tech Blend, partially offset by the proceeds from the Merak, Indonesia and Thane, India land sales.\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2017 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $77 million, purchases of common stock of $61 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $14 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $21 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted under our incentive compensation plans.\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $65 million, purchases of common stock of $45 million, cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $16 million, and a decrease in our overall debt balance of $68 million. The decrease in debt was driven primarily by our redemption of our $300 million 5% fixed rate debt and a reduction in our outstanding commercial paper, partially offset by the issuance of $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026.\nAt September 30, 2018, we had $751 million of availability under our credit agreement. Although generally we have an outstanding commercial paper balance during the quarter, we generally reduce the balance at quarter-end through cash receipts from collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. There was $249 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2018. There was no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2017.\nOur long-term total debt, of which $35 million is current, matures at various times as presented in Note I of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The weighted-average interest rate on our fixed rate long-term debt was 3.5% as of September 30, 2018.\nShare Repurchases\nIn July 2018, the Board of Directors' authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million, 1.1 million, and 0.8 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $138 million, $59 million, and $39 million, respectively. Additionally, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased less than one million shares of our common stock in each year associated with employee tax obligations on stock based compensation awards for $4 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 9.5 million shares available for repurchase under the Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization.\nDividend Payments\nIn fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $1.29, $1.23 and $1.04 per share, respectively. These cash dividend payments totaled $80 million in fiscal 2018, $77 million in fiscal 2017, and $65 million in fiscal 2016.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had a consolidated pension obligation, net of the fair value of plan assets, of $92 million, comprised of $44 million for pension benefit plan liabilities and $48 million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities.\nThe $44 million of unfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair Value of Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded (Unfunded) Status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2018, we made cash contributions totaling approximately $9 million to our foreign pension benefit plans. In fiscal 2019, we expect to make cash contributions of $8 million to our foreign pension plans.\nThe $48 million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of $29 million for our U.S. and $19 million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans. These postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Typical of such plans, our postretirement plans are unfunded and, therefore, have no plan assets. We fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due. In fiscal 2018, we paid postretirement benefits of $3 million under our U.S. postretirement plans and $1 million under our foreign postretirement plans. For fiscal 2019, our benefit payments for our postretirement plans are expected to be $4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our long-term contractual obligations.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Capital lease obligations include interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase Commitments\nWe have entered into long-term, volume-based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers for all of our business segments.

These obligations are payable over the next 15 years.\nLooking forward to fiscal 2019, we believe favorable industry dynamics and Cabot's leadership positions will enable another year of strong growth. There are some near term uncertainties, largely related to trade tariffs between the U.S. and China, volatile commodity prices and new emission testing standards in Europe that are causing disruptions in auto production. These uncertainties are driving certain customers to be cautious in their short-term purchasing behavior, but we do not expect this to have a long-term impact on the business. We continue to expect EBIT growth across all segments in fiscal 2019. Reinforcement Materials is expected to benefit from favorable calendar 2019 customer agreements and our strong market position in Asia. We anticipate that Performance Chemicals EBIT will improve as we move through the year and we begin to see the anticipated benefits of our recent growth investments in the second half of fiscal 2019. We expect that Purification Solutions will benefit from a targeted improvement plan we are implementing to focus our portfolio, optimize our assets and streamline the organizational structure to support the new focus. In addition, we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our Purification Solutions business. We anticipate that Specialty Fluids will continue its recent strong performance into fiscal 2019.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the business segments and primarily benefit corporate objectives, are not allocated to our business segments, such as interest expense and other corporate costs, which include unallocated corporate overhead expenses such as certain corporate salaries and headquarter expenses, plus costs related to special projects and initiatives, which we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d. Management believes excluding the items identified as certain items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis and also facilitates an evaluation of our operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits. The items of income and expense that we have excluded from Total segment EBIT, as applicable, but that are included in our GAAP Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, as applicable, are described below.\nCertain Items:\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $65 million, purchases of common stock of $45 million, cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $16 million, and a decrease in our overall debt balance of $68 million. The decrease in debt was driven primarily by our redemption of our $300 million 5% fixed rate debt and a reduction in our outstanding commercial paper, partially offset by the issuance of $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026.\nIn fiscal 2018, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $86 million when compared to fiscal 2017 driven principally by higher unit margins ($89 million), higher volumes ($19 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($13 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($33 million). Higher unit margins were driven primarily by 2018 contract gains and a favorable spot market in Asia. The higher volumes were primarily due to higher demand in the Americas and Europe. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iii) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions long-lived assets impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Unallocated Items:\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair Value of Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded (Unfunded) Status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of products in our Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Purification Solutions segments. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer cash discounts and volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations.

Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and technical expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nInterest and Dividend Income\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations before income\ntaxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Certain items, pre-tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (248\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Other unallocated items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (115\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (107\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $48 million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of $29 million for our U.S. and $19 million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans. These postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Typical of such plans, our postretirement plans are unfunded and, therefore, have no plan assets. We fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due. In fiscal 2018, we paid postretirement benefits of $3 million under our U.S. postretirement plans and $1 million under our foreign postretirement plans. For fiscal 2019, our benefit payments for our postretirement plans are expected to be $4 million.\nCapital Leases\nSales in Specialty Fluids decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($9 million) from lower project activity levels that resulted in lower rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids. The decrease in volumes was partially offset by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million).\nReinforcement Materials\nIn fiscal 2017, Total other unallocated items changed by $9 million when compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by a change of $4 million of Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax, due to lower earnings from our Venezuelan equity affiliate. In addition, Unallocated corporate costs changed by $5 million primarily associated with higher expenses related to incentive compensation.\nThe following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nRevenue Recognition\nIn Purification Solutions, longer term demand is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon based solutions for water, gas and air, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, catalysts and other chemical applications. Operating results in Purification Solutions have been influenced by: i) changes in our sales volumes in the various applications previously noted; ii) the amount of coal-based power generation utilized in the U.S. and the regulation of those utilities; iii) management of our operations, including inventory levels, and the commensurate costs; iv) changes in price and product mix; and v) industry capacity utilization.\nResearch and technical expenses increased by $10 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to growth investment spending. Research and technical expenses increased by $3 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due to continued spending on projects across the segments.\nTo test for impairment of assets, we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nShare Repurchases\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by net income of $273 million plus $155 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was an increase in accounts payable and accruals and dividends from equity affiliates. These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to higher sales and raw material costs.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\nDrivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment. In Reinforcement Materials, longer term demand is driven primarily by: i) the number of vehicle miles driven globally; ii) the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced; and iii) the number of automotive builds. Over the past several years, operating results have been driven by a number of factors, including: i) increases or decreases in our sales volumes driven by changes in production levels for tires or industrial rubber products and the level at which we service that demand; ii) changes in raw material costs and our ability to adjust the sales price for our products commensurate with changes in raw material costs; iii) changes in pricing and product mix, which includes customer pricing as well as the mix of products sold or the region in which they are sold; iv) global and regional capacity utilization for carbon black; v) fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities; vi) the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies; vii) capacity management and technology investments, including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities; and viii) royalties and technology payments related to our patented elastomer composites technology that is used in tire applications.\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $393 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $307 million), higher volumes ($44 million) and a favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($42 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher pricing from 2018 tire customer agreements, higher spot pricing in Asia, and the passthrough of higher feedstock costs in our pricing. Higher volumes were driven by higher demand in the Americas and Europe.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by net income of $162 million plus $161 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories largely driven by lower raw material costs and associated price reductions. These sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\n \u2022 Non-recurring gains (losses) on foreign exchange, which primarily relate to the impact of controlled currency devaluations on our net monetary assets denominated in that currency. \n\nWe periodically review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory, and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\n</td> </tr>\nAt September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our revolving credit facility including the total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenant.\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2017 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $77 million, purchases of common stock of $61 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $14 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $21 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted under our incentive compensation plans.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by $45 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was principally driven by higher corporate administrative costs, an increase in the reserve for respirator liability matters and higher spending on projects and growth initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $15 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower spending on global restructuring activities in fiscal 2017 and a charge to the respirator reserve in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017.\nAn explanation of these items of expense and income is included in our discussion under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d. Additional information concerning several of these items is included in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as follows: Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets (Note F); Global restructuring activities (Note O); and Inventory reserve adjustment (Note D).\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of the rental process and from the sale of fine cesium chemicals. This revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by net income, which, before non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, totaled $329 million from strong business performance and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in Accounts and notes receivable and Inventories largely driven by higher raw material costs.\nWe file U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Cabot and certain subsidiaries are under audit in a number of jurisdictions. It is possible that some of these audits will be resolved in fiscal 2019 and could impact our anticipated effective tax rate. We have filed our tax returns in accordance with the tax laws in each jurisdiction and maintain tax reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nIn fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $1.29, $1.23 and $1.04 per share, respectively. These cash dividend payments totaled $80 million in fiscal 2018, $77 million in fiscal 2017, and $65 million in fiscal 2016.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nIn fiscal 2017, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $56 million when compared to fiscal 2016 driven principally by higher rubber blacks unit margins ($62 million), higher rubber blacks volumes ($13 million) and the favorable impact from a change in inventory levels ($6 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($21 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The favorable unit margins were due to benefits from customer agreement pricing gains and spot pricing as well as a more favorable regional mix, with higher sales in North America and lower sales in Asia. Higher rubber blacks fixed costs were primarily associated with the timing of required maintenance costs.\nTax-related certain items include discrete tax items, the nature of which are discussed under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d. The tax impact of certain items is determined by (1) starting with the current and deferred income tax expense or benefit, included in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation, and (2) subtracting the tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings\u201d. Adjusted earnings is defined as the pre-tax income attributable to Cabot Corporation excluding certain items. The tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings is calculated by applying the operating tax rate, as defined under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures, to adjusted earnings.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of our reportable segments:\nFinancing activities consumed $141 million of cash in fiscal 2018 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2017 and $184 million in fiscal 2016. The use of cash in fiscal 2018 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $80 million, purchases of common stock of $142 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $21 million. This was offset by an increase in our overall debt balance of $80 million. The increase in debt was driven primarily by an increase in working capital and the acquisition of Tech Blend, partially offset by the proceeds from the Merak, Indonesia and Thane, India land sales.\nOur long-term total debt, of which $35 million is current, matures at various times as presented in Note I of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The weighted-average interest rate on our fixed rate long-term debt was 3.5% as of September 30, 2018.\nEquity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax, decreased by $5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased by $4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The changes in both periods were primarily due to changes in earnings from our Venezuelan equity affiliate.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nEffective October 1, 2017, we changed our method of accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. Total U.S. inventories accounted for utilizing the LIFO cost flow assumption represented 7% of total worldwide inventories as of September 30, 2017 prior to this change in method. We believe the FIFO method is preferable because it: (i) conforms the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories to the inventory valuation methodology for the majority of our other inventories; (ii) better represents how management assesses and reports on the performance of the Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals operating segments that carry U.S. carbon black inventories, as the impact of accounting for this inventory on a LIFO basis has historically been excluded from segment results; (iii) better aligns the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories with the physical flow of that inventory; and (iv) improves comparability with many of our peers. We applied this change retrospectively to all prior periods presented for which details are presented under the heading Inventories\u201d in Note A. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories that are classified as inventory and assets held for rent is determined using the average cost method. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the FIFO method.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to federal income tax law affecting us. Refer to the discussion under the heading Tax Reform\u201d in Note R of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Note R\u201d).\n (ii) Items related to uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included net tax impacts from the reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlement of tax audits, the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, and the accrual of prior year uncertain tax positions, and; \nAs of September 30, 2018, we had a consolidated pension obligation, net of the fair value of plan assets, of $92 million, comprised of $44 million for pension benefit plan liabilities and $48 million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities.\nPurification Solutions Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill Impairment Charges\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. As discussed in Note C of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we acquired Tech Blend in November 2017, and the purchase price allocation included separately identifiable intangible assets of $29 million.\nOverview\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n \u2022 Acquisition and integration-related charges, which include transaction costs, redundant costs incurred during the period of integration, and costs associated with transitioning certain management and business processes to our processes. \nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nSpecialty Fluids\nThe $525 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $323 million), higher volumes ($110 million) and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation ($83 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher spot pricing in Asia and higher selling prices related to calendar year 2018 tire customer agreements. The $306 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $248 million), an increase in volumes ($77 million), partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($24 million). The favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to higher selling prices during the year from price adjustments to customers for increases in raw materials costs.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. Our planned capital spending program for fiscal 2019 is primarily for sustaining, compliance and improvement capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA significant portion of our business occurs outside the U.S. and our cash generation does not always align geographically with our cash needs. The vast majority of our cash and cash equivalent holdings tend to be held outside the U.S. Cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future investments. We use commercial paper throughout the year to manage short term U.S. cash needs. The commercial paper balance is generally reduced at quarter-end using cash derived from customer collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. The balance of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2018 was $249 million. If additional funds are needed in the U.S., we can repatriate offshore earnings.\nInventory Valuation\nRefer to the discussion in Note B of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n (2) For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, Impact of discrete tax items included net discrete tax expense of $148 million, net discrete tax benefit of $25 million and net discrete tax expense of less than $1 million, respectively. Discrete tax items for years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: \nWe have entered into long-term, volume-based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers for all of our business segments. Under certain of these agreements the quantity of material being purchased is fixed, but the price we pay changes as market prices change. For purposes of the table above, current purchase prices have been used to quantify total commitments. We have also entered into long-term purchase agreements primarily for services related to information technology, which are not included in the table above, that total $14 million as of September 30, 2018, the majority of which is expected to be paid within the next 5 years.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, the following other elements of operations have a bearing on operating cash flows:\nA discussion of items that we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d can be found under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d. The balances of unallocated corporate costs are primarily comprised of expenditures related to managing a public company that are not allocated to the segments and corporate business development costs related to ongoing corporate projects. The balances of General unallocated income (expense) consists of gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions, net of other foreign currency risk management activities, interest income, dividend income, the profit or loss related to the corporate adjustment for unearned revenue, and the impact of including the full operating results of a contractual joint venture in Purification Solutions Segment EBIT.\nDividend Payments\nEBIT in Purification Solutions decreased by $13 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by lower unit margins ($11 million), lower volumes ($5 million), the unfavorable impact of changing inventory levels ($7 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by lower fixed costs ($12 million). Lower margins were due to increased competitive intensity in mercury removal and other North American powdered activated carbon applications. Lower fixed costs were due to the savings associated with restructuring actions put in effect during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the lower depreciation and amortization expense from recording an impairment during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note F.\nEBIT in Purification Solutions increased by $11 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 driven by the favorable impact of changing inventory levels ($15 million), higher volumes ($5 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). These improvements were partially offset by lower unit margins ($5 million) and higher fixed costs ($6 million). Higher volumes were due to sales to mercury removal and specialty customers. Higher fixed costs were a result of a plant disruption during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and investment in research and development, marketing and sales resources as we focus on growing the specialty portion of the portfolio.\nInterest expense increased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher commercial paper borrowings throughout the fiscal year. Interest expense decreased by $1 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt partially offset by higher rates on commercial paper borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nWe generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital requirements as needed by region or site. Cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities, except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non-functional currency or debt.\nThe Purification Solutions long-lived assets and goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2018 are described in Note F of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Note F\u201d).\nIn fiscal 2018, Total other unallocated items changed by $8 million when compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by a change of $11 million in Unallocated corporate costs and a change of $1 million in General unallocated income, partially offset by a change of $5 million in Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax. The change in Unallocated corporate costs was primarily due to corporate project spending and higher incentive compensation.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nIn fiscal 2018, EBIT in Performance Chemicals was $1 million lower than in fiscal 2017. Higher volumes ($21 million), higher unit margins ($13 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($8 million) were fully offset by higher fixed costs ($42 million) and the unfavorable impact from inventory changes ($1 million). Unit margins improved in fiscal 2018 due to successfully implementing price increases in excess of higher feedstock costs. Higher volumes were primarily due to growth in Specialty Compounds which includes the acquisition of Tech Blend during fiscal 2018. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\n \u2022 Asset impairment charges, which primarily include charges associated with an impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets. \nLitigation and Contingencies\n\nIn fiscal 2018, we made cash contributions totaling approximately $9 million to our foreign pension benefit plans. In fiscal 2019, we expect to make cash contributions of $8 million to our foreign pension plans.\n \u2022 Employee benefit plan settlement charges, which consist of the costs associated with transferring the obligations and assets held by one of our defined benefit plans to a multi-employer plan. \nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below.\nWe issued $30 million of 7.42% medium term notes in fiscal 1999 that mature on December 11, 2018 and are included in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018. We intend to pay off these notes at maturity with cash on hand and/or commercial paper borrowings.\nResults of Operations\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\n\n (1) Refer to the reconciliation of computed tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the Provision (benefit) for income taxes in Note R. \nIn Performance Chemicals, longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. In recent years, operating results in Performance Chemicals have been driven by: i) increases or decreases in sales volumes to the industries previously noted; ii) our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers' applications; iii) our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation; iv) the cost of new capacity; v) changes in selling prices relative to variations in the cost of raw materials; and vi) the adoption of new products for use in our customers' applications.\n \u2022 Legal and environmental reserves and matters, which consist of costs or benefits for matters typically related to former businesses or that are otherwise incurred outside of the ordinary course of business. \nOperating Leases\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our long-term contractual obligations.\nPerformance Chemicals\nAt September 30, 2018, we had $751 million of availability under our credit agreement. Although generally we have an outstanding commercial paper balance during the quarter, we generally reduce the balance at quarter-end through cash receipts from collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. There was $249 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2018. There was no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2017.\nThe $44 million of unfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows:\nGross profit increased by $118 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by higher volumes and unit margins in Reinforcement Materials, partially offset by higher fixed costs. Gross profit increased by $88 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 driven by higher margins and volumes in Reinforcement Materials.\nIn fiscal 2018, investing activities consumed $246 million, which was primarily driven by $64 million of cash paid for our Specialty Compounds acquisition of Tech Blend, net of cash acquired of $1 million, and capital expenditures of $229 million. These capital expenditures were for sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Offsetting these amounts was an inflow of cash related to the sales of land at our former sites in Merak, Indonesia, and Thane, India and proceeds from the sale of shares of a cost method investment in Asia. In fiscal 2017, capital expenditures were $147 million. Capital expenditures were primarily related to sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities. In fiscal 2016, capital expenditures were $112 million. Major capital project expenditures were related to sustaining and compliance activities.\nOther income (expense) changed during fiscal 2018 by $9 million as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a gain recorded in 2018 on the sale of investments. Other income (expense) changed by $3 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency movements.\n\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Cabot Corporation\n\nOur effective and operating tax rates for fiscal 2019 are expected to be the same and in the range between 22% and 24%.\n\n\nSales and EBIT for Specialty Fluids for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment loss would result. The goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Refer to the discussion under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d for details on the Purification Solutions goodwill impairment test and the resulting charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and refer to Note G of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the results of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018.\nIn November 2013, we purchased all of our joint venture partner's common stock in the former NHUMO, S.A. de C.V. ( NHUMO\u201d) joint venture. At the close of the transaction, NHUMO issued redeemable preferred stock to the joint venture partner with a repurchase value of $25 million and a fixed dividend rate of 6% per annum. In November 2018, we repurchased the preferred stock for $25 million and paid a final dividend payment of approximately $1.4 million.\nCash provided by operating activities, which consists of net income adjusted for the various non-cash items included in income, changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts, totaled $298 million in fiscal 2018. Operating activities provided $348 million and $392 million in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2016, respectively.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, certain items, other unallocated items and Total segment EBIT for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are set forth in the table below. The details of certain items and other unallocated items are shown below and in Note T of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $273 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $260 million) and higher volumes ($27 million), partially offset by the unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($12 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily driven by benefits from higher prices in our tire customer agreements and spot pricing in addition to a more favorable regional mix. Higher volumes were driven by an increase in rubber blacks volumes from higher contractual volumes in the Americas.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement.\nWe have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles, warehouse facilities, office space, and machinery and equipment.\nIn Specialty Fluids, longer term demand is primarily driven by: i) the level of drilling activity utilizing cesium formate for high pressure oil and gas wells; ii) the petroleum industry's acceptance of cesium formate as a drilling and completion fluid for this application; and iii) continued use of fine cesium chemicals in a variety of applications. Operating results in Specialty Fluids are influenced by the number of drilling projects as well as the size, type and duration of those drilling jobs and demand for fine cesium chemicals.\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-Consolidated\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher fixed costs ($1 million).\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nGoodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Reinforcement Materials, and the Fumed Metal Oxides and Specialty Compounds businesses within Performance Chemicals, which are considered separate reporting units, carried our Goodwill balances as of May 31, 2018. The Purification Solutions reporting unit has no remaining goodwill balance subsequent to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As part of the Tech Blend acquisition, goodwill of $33 million was generated and is reflected in the Specialty Compounds reporting unit.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Purification Solutions reporting unit experienced further share losses, lower customer demand and declining prices in the mercury removal and North America powdered activated carbon applications, which led us to reassess our previous estimates for expected growth in volumes, prices and margins in the reporting unit. The forecasted demand and profit margins in mercury removal applications were lowered reflecting further unit closures at coal-fired utility plants, lower usage levels of activated carbon and lower plant utilization levels for coal-fired utilities, as well as lower pricing due to industry overcapacity, among other factors. While development programs continue to progress, growth estimates in other environmental and specialty applications were also lowered, reflecting heightened competition and updated timelines to commercialize certain new products. Due to these revised forecasts, we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $92 million.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nIn fiscal 2018, we reported a net loss of $113 million ($1.85 loss per diluted common share). In fiscal 2017, we reported net income of $248 million ($3.91 per diluted common share). In fiscal 2016, we reported net income of $147 million ($2.32 per diluted common share). The loss in fiscal 2018 was driven by the Purification Solutions long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges more fully discussed in Note F and the impact of tax reform in the U.S.\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nResearch and Technical Expenses\nPurchase Commitments\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings from affiliated companies less certain items and other unallocated items. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of our operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $120 million when compared to fiscal 2017 due to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $36 million), higher volumes ($52 million) and the favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($33 million). The higher volumes were driven by the acquisition of Tech Blend, which led to higher volumes in the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business. The more favorable price and product mix is primarily due to improved mix and price increases in excess of rising feedstock costs within the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business.\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $9 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $16 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($8 million). The less favorable price and product mix was primarily due to price competition in North America for powder activated carbon and weaker mix in specialty applications. The increase in volumes during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to volume growth within mercury removal and specialty applications.\nPrior to determining the goodwill impairment charge, we considered whether the assets of the reporting unit, which is also considered the asset group, were recoverable. As a result of this assessment, we recorded an inventory reserve adjustment of $13 million and impairments to long lived assets of $162 million. The adjustment to inventory carrying value was determined based on reassessments of volumes, pricing, and margins described above and was recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable was based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $64 million and $98 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets.\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\n \u2022 Executive transition costs, which include incremental charges, including stock compensation charges, associated with the retirement or termination of employment of senior executives of the Company. \nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n \u2022 Inventory reserve adjustment, which resulted from an evaluation performed as part of an impairment analysis. \n\nPurification Solutions\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability, decreased by $354 million during fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased commercial paper borrowings, which reduced our borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, and a decrease in our cash balances. As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175 million and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement of $751 million. Our revolving credit agreement, which was amended in October 2017 to extend the maturity to October 2022, supports our commercial paper program and may be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nDrivers of Demand and Key Factors Affecting Profitability\nWe used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and the cost approach to determine the fair value of our property, plant and equipment. We will continue to monitor for events or changes in business circumstances that may indicate that the remaining carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 due to higher interest rates and by $4 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to interest earned on higher cash balances.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nIn fiscal 2017, EBIT in Performance Chemicals decreased by $24 million when compared to fiscal 2016 due to lower unit margins ($33 million), higher fixed costs ($23 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The decrease in unit margins was driven by higher raw material costs. Higher fixed costs were a result of increased maintenance, higher activity levels and growth investments. These decreases in EBIT were partially offset by higher volumes ($32 million) and the favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($2 million). The increase in volumes were primarily driven by growth across all Performance Chemicals product lines during fiscal 2017 with increases in volumes from Asia, North America and Europe.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that the long-lived asset group of Purification Solutions was not recoverable and accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge for the carrying value in excess of the fair value of the asset group, as described below under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\n \u2022 Gains (losses) on sale of investments, which primarily relate to the sale of investments accounted for using the cost method. \nWe recorded a tax benefit related to the impairment charges of $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 which was subsequently reduced by $1 million after the impairment charges by tax jurisdiction were finalized.\nTax Reform\nIn fiscal 2017, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased by $108 million and Total segment EBIT increased by $39 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increases were primarily driven by higher volumes across all segments except Specialty Fluids ($43 million), higher unit margins in Reinforcement Materials ($62 million), and a favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($23 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($49 million), and lower unit margins in Performance Chemicals ($33 million).\nIn July 2018, the Board of Directors' authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million, 1.1 million, and 0.8 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $138 million, $59 million, and $39 million, respectively. Additionally, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased less than one million shares of our common stock in each year associated with employee tax obligations on stock based compensation awards for $4 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 9.5 million shares available for repurchase under the Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $43 million when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher volumes across all product lines ($51 million) and a favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million), partially offset by an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($11 million). The higher volumes were mainly driven by growth in sales in Asia and North America.\n (iii) Other discrete tax items during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included changes in valuation allowances on beginning of year tax balances, the net tax impact of various return to provision adjustments related to tax return filings, changes in non-U.S. tax laws and audit settlements (fiscal 2018 only). \nSales and EBIT for Reinforcement Materials for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nOverview of Results for Fiscal 2018\n \u2022 Global restructuring activities include costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures, which primarily relate to (i) employee termination costs, (ii) asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions, (iii) costs to close facilities, including environmental costs and contract termination penalties and (iv) gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations. \nRestructurings - As of September 30, 2018, we had $5 million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to our global restructuring activities. We made cash payments of $5 million during fiscal 2018 and received cash payments of $39 million related to the sale of land at our former sites in Thane, India and Merak, Indonesia. In fiscal 2019 and thereafter, we expect to make cash payments totaling approximately $5 million related to these restructuring plans.\nDetails of the certain items for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nSales in Specialty Fluids increased by $4 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of project activity that resulted in higher rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids.\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including growth rates in environmental and specialty applications and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to federal income tax law affecting us, including a permanent reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, as well as a 100% dividend received deduction for foreign dividends. Although the passage of the Act reduced the U.S. tax rate and effectively created a participation exemption regime, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by certain other aspects of the new legislation, including in particular, immediate U.S. taxation of global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries. In transitioning to this new full participation exemption regime for foreign earnings, we are also subject to a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Refer to the discussion under the heading Tax Reform\u201d in Note R.\n\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIn fiscal 2018, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $182 million, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets of Purification Solutions ($254 million). Total segment EBIT increased by $71 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in Total segment EBIT was driven by higher unit margins ($73 million), higher volumes ($53 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($20 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($64 million). The increase in margins and volumes was driven by Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. The increase in fixed costs in fiscal 2018 was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.", "item_7_text": "Sales in Purification Solutions decreased by $2 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower volumes ($9 million) and a less favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($9 million). The lower volumes were due to increased competition, customer curtailments and reduced usage in the mercury removal application.\n\nThe term product mix\u201d refers to the mix of types and grades of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business and/or segment.\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $4 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($6 million), which was partially offset by an improved price and product mix ($2 million).\nShipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Taxes collected on sales to customers are excluded from revenues.\nEnvironmental Reserves and Litigation Matters-As of September 30, 2018, we had a $15 million reserve for environmental remediation costs at various sites. These sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018, we had a $25 million reserve for respirator claims. Expenditures for each of these reserves will be incurred over many years. We also have other litigation costs arising in the ordinary course of business.\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the Purification Solutions goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSales and EBIT for Purification Solutions for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nSales and EBIT for Performance Chemicals for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nWe have capital lease obligations primarily for certain equipment and buildings. These obligations are payable over the next 15 years.\nLooking forward to fiscal 2019, we believe favorable industry dynamics and Cabot's leadership positions will enable another year of strong growth. There are some near term uncertainties, largely related to trade tariffs between the U.S. and China, volatile commodity prices and new emission testing standards in Europe that are causing disruptions in auto production. These uncertainties are driving certain customers to be cautious in their short-term purchasing behavior, but we do not expect this to have a long-term impact on the business. We continue to expect EBIT growth across all segments in fiscal 2019. Reinforcement Materials is expected to benefit from favorable calendar 2019 customer agreements and our strong market position in Asia. We anticipate that Performance Chemicals EBIT will improve as we move through the year and we begin to see the anticipated benefits of our recent growth investments in the second half of fiscal 2019. We expect that Purification Solutions will benefit from a targeted improvement plan we are implementing to focus our portfolio, optimize our assets and streamline the organizational structure to support the new focus. In addition, we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our Purification Solutions business. We anticipate that Specialty Fluids will continue its recent strong performance into fiscal 2019.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the business segments and primarily benefit corporate objectives, are not allocated to our business segments, such as interest expense and other corporate costs, which include unallocated corporate overhead expenses such as certain corporate salaries and headquarter expenses, plus costs related to special projects and initiatives, which we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d. Management believes excluding the items identified as certain items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis and also facilitates an evaluation of our operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits. The items of income and expense that we have excluded from Total segment EBIT, as applicable, but that are included in our GAAP Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, as applicable, are described below.\nCertain Items:\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $65 million, purchases of common stock of $45 million, cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $16 million, and a decrease in our overall debt balance of $68 million. The decrease in debt was driven primarily by our redemption of our $300 million 5% fixed rate debt and a reduction in our outstanding commercial paper, partially offset by the issuance of $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026.\nIn fiscal 2018, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $86 million when compared to fiscal 2017 driven principally by higher unit margins ($89 million), higher volumes ($19 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($13 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($33 million). Higher unit margins were driven primarily by 2018 contract gains and a favorable spot market in Asia. The higher volumes were primarily due to higher demand in the Americas and Europe. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iii) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\nOther Unallocated Items:\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nWe derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of products in our Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Purification Solutions segments. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer cash discounts and volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. We periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly.\n\nInterest Expense\nItem 7.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, increased by $14 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased by $10 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to the higher profitability of our joint ventures in China and the Czech Republic.\nNet Sales and Other Operating Revenues and Gross Profit\n (i) Unusual or infrequent items during fiscal 2018 consisted of the net tax impacts of the Act (net tax expense of $159 million), cash management activities, foreign exchange gain/loss on the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, and excludible foreign exchange gains and losses in certain jurisdictions. Unusual or infrequent items during fiscal 2017 consisted of the net tax impacts of excess foreign tax credits upon repatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings and the accrual of U.S. tax on certain foreign earnings. Unusual or infrequent items during fiscal 2016 included net tax impacts from the renewal of the U.S. Research and Experimentation credit, extraordinary dividends from subsidiaries, a claim for U.S. tax benefit, and other non-routine items; \nWe anticipate sufficient liquidity from (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flows from operating activities; and (iii) cash available from our revolving credit agreement and our commercial paper program to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. The liquidity we derive from cash flows from operations is, to a large degree, predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner, the cost of our raw materials, and our ability to manage inventory levels.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised of trademarks, customer relationships and developed technologies, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. We recognized an impairment on intangible assets associated with the Purification Solutions business in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, which is discussed in detail below under the heading Purifications Solutions Goodwill and Long-lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\n (1) Capital lease obligations include interest. \n</table>\nOutlook\nWe have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in Note A in Item 8 below. Certain of these policies include the use of estimates, but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure. However, these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe $48 million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of $29 million for our U.S. and $19 million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans. These postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Typical of such plans, our postretirement plans are unfunded and, therefore, have no plan assets. We fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due. In fiscal 2018, we paid postretirement benefits of $3 million under our U.S. postretirement plans and $1 million under our foreign postretirement plans. For fiscal 2019, our benefit payments for our postretirement plans are expected to be $4 million.\nCapital Leases\nSales in Specialty Fluids decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($9 million) from lower project activity levels that resulted in lower rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids. The decrease in volumes was partially offset by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million).\nReinforcement Materials\nIn fiscal 2017, Total other unallocated items changed by $9 million when compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by a change of $4 million of Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax, due to lower earnings from our Venezuelan equity affiliate. In addition, Unallocated corporate costs changed by $5 million primarily associated with higher expenses related to incentive compensation.\nThe following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\nContractual Obligations\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nRevenue Recognition\nIn Purification Solutions, longer term demand is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon based solutions for water, gas and air, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, catalysts and other chemical applications. Operating results in Purification Solutions have been influenced by: i) changes in our sales volumes in the various applications previously noted; ii) the amount of coal-based power generation utilized in the U.S. and the regulation of those utilities; iii) management of our operations, including inventory levels, and the commensurate costs; iv) changes in price and product mix; and v) industry capacity utilization.\nResearch and technical expenses increased by $10 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to growth investment spending. Research and technical expenses increased by $3 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due to continued spending on projects across the segments.\nTo test for impairment of assets, we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nShare Repurchases\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by net income of $273 million plus $155 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was an increase in accounts payable and accruals and dividends from equity affiliates. These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to higher sales and raw material costs.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\nDrivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment. In Reinforcement Materials, longer term demand is driven primarily by: i) the number of vehicle miles driven globally; ii) the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced; and iii) the number of automotive builds. Over the past several years, operating results have been driven by a number of factors, including: i) increases or decreases in our sales volumes driven by changes in production levels for tires or industrial rubber products and the level at which we service that demand; ii) changes in raw material costs and our ability to adjust the sales price for our products commensurate with changes in raw material costs; iii) changes in pricing and product mix, which includes customer pricing as well as the mix of products sold or the region in which they are sold; iv) global and regional capacity utilization for carbon black; v) fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities; vi) the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies; vii) capacity management and technology investments, including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities; and viii) royalties and technology payments related to our patented elastomer composites technology that is used in tire applications.\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $393 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $307 million), higher volumes ($44 million) and a favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($42 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher pricing from 2018 tire customer agreements, higher spot pricing in Asia, and the passthrough of higher feedstock costs in our pricing. Higher volumes were driven by higher demand in the Americas and Europe.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by net income of $162 million plus $161 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories largely driven by lower raw material costs and associated price reductions. These sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\n \u2022 Non-recurring gains (losses) on foreign exchange, which primarily relate to the impact of controlled currency devaluations on our net monetary assets denominated in that currency. \n\nWe periodically review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory, and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\n</td> </tr>\nAt September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our revolving credit facility including the total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenant.\nThe use of cash in fiscal 2017 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $77 million, purchases of common stock of $61 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $14 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $21 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted under our incentive compensation plans.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by $45 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.The increase was principally driven by higher corporate administrative costs, an increase in the reserve for respirator liability matters and higher spending on projects and growth initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $15 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower spending on global restructuring activities in fiscal 2017 and a charge to the respirator reserve in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017.\nAn explanation of these items of expense and income is included in our discussion under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d. Additional information concerning several of these items is included in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as follows: Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets (Note F); Global restructuring activities (Note O); and Inventory reserve adjustment (Note D).\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of the rental process and from the sale of fine cesium chemicals. This revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by net income, which, before non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, totaled $329 million from strong business performance and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in Accounts and notes receivable and Inventories largely driven by higher raw material costs.\nWe file U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Cabot and certain subsidiaries are under audit in a number of jurisdictions. It is possible that some of these audits will be resolved in fiscal 2019 and could impact our anticipated effective tax rate. We have filed our tax returns in accordance with the tax laws in each jurisdiction and maintain tax reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nIn fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $1.29, $1.23 and $1.04 per share, respectively. These cash dividend payments totaled $80 million in fiscal 2018, $77 million in fiscal 2017, and $65 million in fiscal 2016.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nIn fiscal 2017, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $56 million when compared to fiscal 2016 driven principally by higher rubber blacks unit margins ($62 million), higher rubber blacks volumes ($13 million) and the favorable impact from a change in inventory levels ($6 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($21 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The favorable unit margins were due to benefits from customer agreement pricing gains and spot pricing as well as a more favorable regional mix, with higher sales in North America and lower sales in Asia. Higher rubber blacks fixed costs were primarily associated with the timing of required maintenance costs.\nTax-related certain items include discrete tax items, the nature of which are discussed under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d. The tax impact of certain items is determined by (1) starting with the current and deferred income tax expense or benefit, included in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation, and (2) subtracting the tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings\u201d. Adjusted earnings is defined as the pre-tax income attributable to Cabot Corporation excluding certain items. The tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings is calculated by applying the operating tax rate, as defined under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures, to adjusted earnings.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of our reportable segments:\nFinancing activities consumed $141 million of cash in fiscal 2018 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2017 and $184 million in fiscal 2016. The use of cash in fiscal 2018 was primarily related to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $80 million, purchases of common stock of $142 million, and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $21 million. This was offset by an increase in our overall debt balance of $80 million. The increase in debt was driven primarily by an increase in working capital and the acquisition of Tech Blend, partially offset by the proceeds from the Merak, Indonesia and Thane, India land sales.\nOur long-term total debt, of which $35 million is current, matures at various times as presented in Note I of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The weighted-average interest rate on our fixed rate long-term debt was 3.5% as of September 30, 2018.\nEquity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax, decreased by $5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased by $4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The changes in both periods were primarily due to changes in earnings from our Venezuelan equity affiliate.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nEffective October 1, 2017, we changed our method of accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. Total U.S. inventories accounted for utilizing the LIFO cost flow assumption represented 7% of total worldwide inventories as of September 30, 2017 prior to this change in method. We believe the FIFO method is preferable because it: (i) conforms the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories to the inventory valuation methodology for the majority of our other inventories; (ii) better represents how management assesses and reports on the performance of the Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals operating segments that carry U.S. carbon black inventories, as the impact of accounting for this inventory on a LIFO basis has historically been excluded from segment results; (iii) better aligns the accounting for U.S. carbon black inventories with the physical flow of that inventory; and (iv) improves comparability with many of our peers. We applied this change retrospectively to all prior periods presented for which details are presented under the heading Inventories\u201d in Note A. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories that are classified as inventory and assets held for rent is determined using the average cost method. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the FIFO method.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to federal income tax law affecting us. Refer to the discussion under the heading Tax Reform\u201d in Note R of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Note R\u201d).\n (ii) Items related to uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included net tax impacts from the reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlement of tax audits, the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, and the accrual of prior year uncertain tax positions, and; \nAs of September 30, 2018, we had a consolidated pension obligation, net of the fair value of plan assets, of $92 million, comprised of $44 million for pension benefit plan liabilities and $48 million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities.\nPurification Solutions Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill Impairment Charges\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. As discussed in Note C of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we acquired Tech Blend in November 2017, and the purchase price allocation included separately identifiable intangible assets of $29 million.\nOverview\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n \u2022 Acquisition and integration-related charges, which include transaction costs, redundant costs incurred during the period of integration, and costs associated with transitioning certain management and business processes to our processes. \nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nSpecialty Fluids\nThe $525 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $323 million), higher volumes ($110 million) and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation ($83 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to higher spot pricing in Asia and higher selling prices related to calendar year 2018 tire customer agreements. The $306 million increase in net sales from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was due primarily to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $248 million), an increase in volumes ($77 million), partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($24 million). The favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to higher selling prices during the year from price adjustments to customers for increases in raw materials costs.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. Our planned capital spending program for fiscal 2019 is primarily for sustaining, compliance and improvement capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA significant portion of our business occurs outside the U.S. and our cash generation does not always align geographically with our cash needs. The vast majority of our cash and cash equivalent holdings tend to be held outside the U.S. Cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future investments. We use commercial paper throughout the year to manage short term U.S. cash needs. The commercial paper balance is generally reduced at quarter-end using cash derived from customer collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. The balance of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2018 was $249 million. If additional funds are needed in the U.S., we can repatriate offshore earnings.\nInventory Valuation\nRefer to the discussion in Note B of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n (2) For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, Impact of discrete tax items included net discrete tax expense of $148 million, net discrete tax benefit of $25 million and net discrete tax expense of less than $1 million, respectively. Discrete tax items for years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: \nWe have entered into long-term, volume-based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers for all of our business segments. Under certain of these agreements the quantity of material being purchased is fixed, but the price we pay changes as market prices change. For purposes of the table above, current purchase prices have been used to quantify total commitments. We have also entered into long-term purchase agreements primarily for services related to information technology, which are not included in the table above, that total $14 million as of September 30, 2018, the majority of which is expected to be paid within the next 5 years.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, the following other elements of operations have a bearing on operating cash flows:\nA discussion of items that we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d can be found under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d. The balances of unallocated corporate costs are primarily comprised of expenditures related to managing a public company that are not allocated to the segments and corporate business development costs related to ongoing corporate projects. The balances of General unallocated income (expense) consists of gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions, net of other foreign currency risk management activities, interest income, dividend income, the profit or loss related to the corporate adjustment for unearned revenue, and the impact of including the full operating results of a contractual joint venture in Purification Solutions Segment EBIT.\nDividend Payments\nEBIT in Purification Solutions decreased by $13 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by lower unit margins ($11 million), lower volumes ($5 million), the unfavorable impact of changing inventory levels ($7 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by lower fixed costs ($12 million). Lower margins were due to increased competitive intensity in mercury removal and other North American powdered activated carbon applications. Lower fixed costs were due to the savings associated with restructuring actions put in effect during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the lower depreciation and amortization expense from recording an impairment during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as discussed in Note F.\nEBIT in Purification Solutions increased by $11 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 driven by the favorable impact of changing inventory levels ($15 million), higher volumes ($5 million) and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). These improvements were partially offset by lower unit margins ($5 million) and higher fixed costs ($6 million). Higher volumes were due to sales to mercury removal and specialty customers. Higher fixed costs were a result of a plant disruption during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and investment in research and development, marketing and sales resources as we focus on growing the specialty portion of the portfolio.\nInterest expense increased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher commercial paper borrowings throughout the fiscal year. Interest expense decreased by $1 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt partially offset by higher rates on commercial paper borrowings.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nWe generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital requirements as needed by region or site. Cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities, except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non-functional currency or debt.\nThe Purification Solutions long-lived assets and goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2018 are described in Note F of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Note F\u201d).\nIn fiscal 2018, Total other unallocated items changed by $8 million when compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by a change of $11 million in Unallocated corporate costs and a change of $1 million in General unallocated income, partially offset by a change of $5 million in Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax. The change in Unallocated corporate costs was primarily due to corporate project spending and higher incentive compensation.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nIn fiscal 2018, EBIT in Performance Chemicals was $1 million lower than in fiscal 2017. Higher volumes ($21 million), higher unit margins ($13 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($8 million) were fully offset by higher fixed costs ($42 million) and the unfavorable impact from inventory changes ($1 million). Unit margins improved in fiscal 2018 due to successfully implementing price increases in excess of higher feedstock costs. Higher volumes were primarily due to growth in Specialty Compounds which includes the acquisition of Tech Blend during fiscal 2018. The increase in fixed costs was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.\n \u2022 Asset impairment charges, which primarily include charges associated with an impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets. \nLitigation and Contingencies\n\nIn fiscal 2018, we made cash contributions totaling approximately $9 million to our foreign pension benefit plans. In fiscal 2019, we expect to make cash contributions of $8 million to our foreign pension plans.\n \u2022 Employee benefit plan settlement charges, which consist of the costs associated with transferring the obligations and assets held by one of our defined benefit plans to a multi-employer plan. \nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below.\nWe issued $30 million of 7.42% medium term notes in fiscal 1999 that mature on December 11, 2018 and are included in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018. We intend to pay off these notes at maturity with cash on hand and/or commercial paper borrowings.\nResults of Operations\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\n\n (1) Refer to the reconciliation of computed tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the Provision (benefit) for income taxes in Note R. \nIn Performance Chemicals, longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. In recent years, operating results in Performance Chemicals have been driven by: i) increases or decreases in sales volumes to the industries previously noted; ii) our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers' applications; iii) our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation; iv) the cost of new capacity; v) changes in selling prices relative to variations in the cost of raw materials; and vi) the adoption of new products for use in our customers' applications.\n \u2022 Legal and environmental reserves and matters, which consist of costs or benefits for matters typically related to former businesses or that are otherwise incurred outside of the ordinary course of business. \nOperating Leases\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our long-term contractual obligations.\nPerformance Chemicals\nAt September 30, 2018, we had $751 million of availability under our credit agreement. Although generally we have an outstanding commercial paper balance during the quarter, we generally reduce the balance at quarter-end through cash receipts from collections, settlement of intercompany balances and short-term intercompany loans. There was $249 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2018. There was no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2017.\nThe $44 million of unfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows:\nGross profit increased by $118 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 driven by higher volumes and unit margins in Reinforcement Materials, partially offset by higher fixed costs. Gross profit increased by $88 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 driven by higher margins and volumes in Reinforcement Materials.\nIn fiscal 2018, investing activities consumed $246 million, which was primarily driven by $64 million of cash paid for our Specialty Compounds acquisition of Tech Blend, net of cash acquired of $1 million, and capital expenditures of $229 million. These capital expenditures were for sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities as well as capacity expansion capital expenditures in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Offsetting these amounts was an inflow of cash related to the sales of land at our former sites in Merak, Indonesia, and Thane, India and proceeds from the sale of shares of a cost method investment in Asia. In fiscal 2017, capital expenditures were $147 million. Capital expenditures were primarily related to sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities. In fiscal 2016, capital expenditures were $112 million. Major capital project expenditures were related to sustaining and compliance activities.\nOther income (expense) changed during fiscal 2018 by $9 million as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a gain recorded in 2018 on the sale of investments. Other income (expense) changed by $3 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency movements.\n\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Cabot Corporation\n\nOur effective and operating tax rates for fiscal 2019 are expected to be the same and in the range between 22% and 24%.\n\n\nSales and EBIT for Specialty Fluids for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment loss would result. The goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Refer to the discussion under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d for details on the Purification Solutions goodwill impairment test and the resulting charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and refer to Note G of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the results of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018.\nIn November 2013, we purchased all of our joint venture partner's common stock in the former NHUMO, S.A. de C.V. ( NHUMO\u201d) joint venture. At the close of the transaction, NHUMO issued redeemable preferred stock to the joint venture partner with a repurchase value of $25 million and a fixed dividend rate of 6% per annum. In November 2018, we repurchased the preferred stock for $25 million and paid a final dividend payment of approximately $1.4 million.\nCash provided by operating activities, which consists of net income adjusted for the various non-cash items included in income, changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts, totaled $298 million in fiscal 2018. Operating activities provided $348 million and $392 million in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2016, respectively.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, certain items, other unallocated items and Total segment EBIT for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are set forth in the table below. The details of certain items and other unallocated items are shown below and in Note T of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Reinforcement Materials increased by $273 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was principally driven by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $260 million) and higher volumes ($27 million), partially offset by the unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($12 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily driven by benefits from higher prices in our tire customer agreements and spot pricing in addition to a more favorable regional mix. Higher volumes were driven by an increase in rubber blacks volumes from higher contractual volumes in the Americas.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement.\nWe have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles, warehouse facilities, office space, and machinery and equipment.\nIn Specialty Fluids, longer term demand is primarily driven by: i) the level of drilling activity utilizing cesium formate for high pressure oil and gas wells; ii) the petroleum industry's acceptance of cesium formate as a drilling and completion fluid for this application; and iii) continued use of fine cesium chemicals in a variety of applications. Operating results in Specialty Fluids are influenced by the number of drilling projects as well as the size, type and duration of those drilling jobs and demand for fine cesium chemicals.\nFiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-Consolidated\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher fixed costs ($1 million).\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nGoodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Reinforcement Materials, and the Fumed Metal Oxides and Specialty Compounds businesses within Performance Chemicals, which are considered separate reporting units, carried our Goodwill balances as of May 31, 2018. The Purification Solutions reporting unit has no remaining goodwill balance subsequent to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As part of the Tech Blend acquisition, goodwill of $33 million was generated and is reflected in the Specialty Compounds reporting unit.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Purification Solutions reporting unit experienced further share losses, lower customer demand and declining prices in the mercury removal and North America powdered activated carbon applications, which led us to reassess our previous estimates for expected growth in volumes, prices and margins in the reporting unit. The forecasted demand and profit margins in mercury removal applications were lowered reflecting further unit closures at coal-fired utility plants, lower usage levels of activated carbon and lower plant utilization levels for coal-fired utilities, as well as lower pricing due to industry overcapacity, among other factors. While development programs continue to progress, growth estimates in other environmental and specialty applications were also lowered, reflecting heightened competition and updated timelines to commercialize certain new products. Due to these revised forecasts, we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $92 million.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nIn fiscal 2018, we reported a net loss of $113 million ($1.85 loss per diluted common share). In fiscal 2017, we reported net income of $248 million ($3.91 per diluted common share). In fiscal 2016, we reported net income of $147 million ($2.32 per diluted common share). The loss in fiscal 2018 was driven by the Purification Solutions long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges more fully discussed in Note F and the impact of tax reform in the U.S.\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nResearch and Technical Expenses\nPurchase Commitments\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings from affiliated companies less certain items and other unallocated items. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of our operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided under the heading Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016-By Business Segment\u201d. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn fiscal 2018, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $120 million when compared to fiscal 2017 due to a more favorable price and product mix (combined $36 million), higher volumes ($52 million) and the favorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($33 million). The higher volumes were driven by the acquisition of Tech Blend, which led to higher volumes in the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business. The more favorable price and product mix is primarily due to improved mix and price increases in excess of rising feedstock costs within the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business.\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $9 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $16 million) and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($8 million). The less favorable price and product mix was primarily due to price competition in North America for powder activated carbon and weaker mix in specialty applications. The increase in volumes during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to volume growth within mercury removal and specialty applications.\nPrior to determining the goodwill impairment charge, we considered whether the assets of the reporting unit, which is also considered the asset group, were recoverable. As a result of this assessment, we recorded an inventory reserve adjustment of $13 million and impairments to long lived assets of $162 million. The adjustment to inventory carrying value was determined based on reassessments of volumes, pricing, and margins described above and was recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable was based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $64 million and $98 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets.\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\n \u2022 Executive transition costs, which include incremental charges, including stock compensation charges, associated with the retirement or termination of employment of senior executives of the Company. \nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n \u2022 Inventory reserve adjustment, which resulted from an evaluation performed as part of an impairment analysis. \n\nPurification Solutions\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability, decreased by $354 million during fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased commercial paper borrowings, which reduced our borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, and a decrease in our cash balances. As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175 million and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement of $751 million. Our revolving credit agreement, which was amended in October 2017 to extend the maturity to October 2022, supports our commercial paper program and may be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nDrivers of Demand and Key Factors Affecting Profitability\nWe used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and the cost approach to determine the fair value of our property, plant and equipment. We will continue to monitor for events or changes in business circumstances that may indicate that the remaining carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $1 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 due to higher interest rates and by $4 million in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to interest earned on higher cash balances.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nIn fiscal 2017, EBIT in Performance Chemicals decreased by $24 million when compared to fiscal 2016 due to lower unit margins ($33 million), higher fixed costs ($23 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($2 million). The decrease in unit margins was driven by higher raw material costs. Higher fixed costs were a result of increased maintenance, higher activity levels and growth investments. These decreases in EBIT were partially offset by higher volumes ($32 million) and the favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($2 million). The increase in volumes were primarily driven by growth across all Performance Chemicals product lines during fiscal 2017 with increases in volumes from Asia, North America and Europe.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we determined that the long-lived asset group of Purification Solutions was not recoverable and accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge for the carrying value in excess of the fair value of the asset group, as described below under the heading Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\n \u2022 Gains (losses) on sale of investments, which primarily relate to the sale of investments accounted for using the cost method. \nWe recorded a tax benefit related to the impairment charges of $30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 which was subsequently reduced by $1 million after the impairment charges by tax jurisdiction were finalized.\nTax Reform\nIn fiscal 2017, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased by $108 million and Total segment EBIT increased by $39 million when compared to fiscal 2016. The increases were primarily driven by higher volumes across all segments except Specialty Fluids ($43 million), higher unit margins in Reinforcement Materials ($62 million), and a favorable impact from changing inventory levels ($23 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($49 million), and lower unit margins in Performance Chemicals ($33 million).\nIn July 2018, the Board of Directors' authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million, 1.1 million, and 0.8 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $138 million, $59 million, and $39 million, respectively. Additionally, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased less than one million shares of our common stock in each year associated with employee tax obligations on stock based compensation awards for $4 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 9.5 million shares available for repurchase under the Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization.\nIn fiscal 2017, sales in Performance Chemicals increased by $43 million when compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher volumes across all product lines ($51 million) and a favorable price and product mix (combined $2 million), partially offset by an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($11 million). The higher volumes were mainly driven by growth in sales in Asia and North America.\n (iii) Other discrete tax items during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included changes in valuation allowances on beginning of year tax balances, the net tax impact of various return to provision adjustments related to tax return filings, changes in non-U.S. tax laws and audit settlements (fiscal 2018 only). \nSales and EBIT for Reinforcement Materials for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nOverview of Results for Fiscal 2018\n \u2022 Global restructuring activities include costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures, which primarily relate to (i) employee termination costs, (ii) asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions, (iii) costs to close facilities, including environmental costs and contract termination penalties and (iv) gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations. \nRestructurings - As of September 30, 2018, we had $5 million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to our global restructuring activities. We made cash payments of $5 million during fiscal 2018 and received cash payments of $39 million related to the sale of land at our former sites in Thane, India and Merak, Indonesia. In fiscal 2019 and thereafter, we expect to make cash payments totaling approximately $5 million related to these restructuring plans.\nDetails of the certain items for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:\nSales in Specialty Fluids increased by $4 million in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of project activity that resulted in higher rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids.\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including growth rates in environmental and specialty applications and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to federal income tax law affecting us, including a permanent reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, as well as a 100% dividend received deduction for foreign dividends. Although the passage of the Act reduced the U.S. tax rate and effectively created a participation exemption regime, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by certain other aspects of the new legislation, including in particular, immediate U.S. taxation of global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries. In transitioning to this new full participation exemption regime for foreign earnings, we are also subject to a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Refer to the discussion under the heading Tax Reform\u201d in Note R.\n\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIn fiscal 2018, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $182 million, primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets of Purification Solutions ($254 million). Total segment EBIT increased by $71 million when compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in Total segment EBIT was driven by higher unit margins ($73 million), higher volumes ($53 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($20 million), partially offset by higher fixed costs ($64 million). The increase in margins and volumes was driven by Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. The increase in fixed costs in fiscal 2018 was due to several factors: (i) higher sales volumes, which led to higher costs in areas such as warehousing and shipping; (ii) costs associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the fumed metal oxides business in North America and China that are not yet operational; (iii) higher maintenance costs to ensure asset reliability as our volumes grow; and (iv) higher commercial and technology investment to drive business and new product growth.", "item_7_tables": "Table 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended
