The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.\nOverview\nWe are a medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices and implants largely used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. To a lesser extent, our devices also treat cardiovascular disease and are used in neurosurgery applications. We also provide processing and cryopreservation services of peripheral vascular human tissue for implantation into patients. Our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim. We estimate that the annual worldwide market for all of our devices exceeds $5 billion, within which our core product lines address roughly $900 million. We have grown our business using a three-pronged strategy: 1) pursuing a focused call point, 2) competing for sales of low-rivalry niche products, and 3) expanding our worldwide direct sales force while acquiring and developing complementary vascular and other devices. We have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the peripheral vascular device market, and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future. We currently manufacture most of our products in our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\nOur products are used primarily by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgery and endovascular techniques. In contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists, neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures, vascular surgeons can perform both open surgery and minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide a wider range of treatment options to patients.\nOur principal product lines include the following: valvulotomes, biologic vascular patches, carotid shunts, embolectomy catheters, biologic vascular grafts, anastomotic clips, radiopaque marking tape, powered phlebectomy devices, prosthetic vascular grafts, surgical glue and remote endarterectomy devices. Through our RestoreFlow allografts business we also provide services related to the processing and cryopreservation of human vascular and cardiac tissue.\nTo assist us in evaluating our business strategies, we regularly monitor long-term technology trends in peripheral vascular and other device markets. Additionally, we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products, including potential new product launches. We also use this information to help determine our competitive position and our manufacturing capacity requirements.\nHistorically we have experienced success in lower-rivalry niche product segments, for example the markets for valvulotome devices and biologic vascular patches. More recently, however, we have faced increased competition in the biologic vascular patch segment, which has inhibited our ability to continue to increase market share or to implement selling price increases. In the valvulotome market, our highly differentiated devices have historically allowed us to increase our selling prices while maintaining our unit market share. In contrast, we have experienced less success in highly competitive markets such as our ProCol biologic graft product line, where we face strong competition from larger companies with greater resources. While we believe that these challenging market dynamics can be mitigated by our relationships with vascular surgeons, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these highly competitive markets.\nIn recent years we have also experienced success in international markets, such as Europe, where we sometimes offer comparatively lower average selling prices. If we continue to seek growth opportunities outside of North America, we may experience downward pressure on our gross margin.\nOur business opportunities include the following:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the long-term growth of our direct sales force in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the addition of complementary products through acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the introduction of our products in new territories upon receipt of regulatory approvals or registrations in these territories;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the consolidation of product manufacturing into our Burlington, Massachusetts corporate headquarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force. As of December 31, 2019 our sales force was comprised of 112 sales representatives in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim, including three export managers, one in each of the three geographic regions. Our worldwide headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and we also have North American sales offices in Chandler, Arizona and Vaughan, Canada. Our European headquarters is located in Sulzbach, Germany, and we also have European sales offices in Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; and Hereford, England. Our Asia/Pacific Rim headquarters is located in Singapore, and we have Asia/Pacific Rim sales offices in Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; and North Melbourne, Australia. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 94% and 95%, respectively, of our net sales were generated in territories in which we employ direct sales representatives. We also sell our products in other countries, including Korea, Russia and Brazil among others, through distributors.\nBecause we believe that direct-to-hospital sales engender closer customer relationships, and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins, we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices towards our direct sales organization:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In December 2015, we signed a master distribution agreement with Meheco Yonstron Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Meheco), a Chinese distribution and logistics company, and began selling our Chinese market products to Meheco in 2016. Meheco then sold our products to multiple sub-distributors who then sold to Chinese hospitals. This agreement expired in December 2017, and we are currently in the process of signing distribution agreements with sub-distributors and have begun selling our products to sub-distributors in China. We repurchased $120,000 of our products from Meheco in 2018, which resulted in a corresponding revenue reversal.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In March 2018, we terminated our master distribution agreement with Sinopharm United Medical Device Co., Ltd.

We repurchased $159,000 of our products from UCMC in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with several former Applied Medical and Cardial distributors in Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim in order to terminate their distribution of our recently acquired catheter, polyester graft and valvulotome products, and we began selling direct-to-hospitals in those geographies. The termination fees totaled approximately $0.1 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies, and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets related to the peripheral vascular allograft operations of Restore Flow Allografts, LLC for $12.0 million plus additional payments of up to $6.0 million depending upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In April 2018, we sold our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. for $7.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In September 2018, we acquired the assets of the embolectomy catheter business from Applied Medical Resources Corporation for $14.2 million.

We expect these plant consolidations will result in improved control over our production quality as well as reduced costs over the long-term. Our most recent manufacturing transitions included\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In 2016, we initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the ProCol biologic product line to our facility in Burlington.

We expect this transfer to be completed in 2020. The cost of the buildout was approximately $0.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur execution of these business opportunities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period as we incur related process engineering and other charges.\nFluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, affect our financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our sales took place outside the United States, largely in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect foreign currencies will represent a significant percentage of our future sales. Selling, marketing, and administrative costs related to these sales are also denominated in foreign currencies, thereby partially mitigating our bottom-line exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. However, if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for U.S. dollars, it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate increase. In such cases we will receive less revenue in U.S. dollars than we did before the exchange rate changed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales by approximately $2.3 million, as compared to rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Sales and Expense Components\nThe following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses:\nNet sales. We derive our net sales from the sale of our products and services, less discounts and returns. Net sales include the shipping and handling fees paid for by our customers. Most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world. In countries where we do not have a direct sales force, sales are primarily to distributors, who in turn sell to hospitals and clinics. In certain cases our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic prior to purchase; in those instances we recognize revenue at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment.\nCost of sales. We manufacture the majority of the products that we sell. Our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel, raw materials and components, depreciation of property and equipment, and other allocated manufacturing overhead, as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries, commissions, stock based compensation, travel and entertainment, attendance at vascular congresses, training programs, advertising and product promotions, direct mail and other marketing costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of executive, finance and human resource salaries, stock based compensation, legal and accounting fees, information technology expense, intangible asset amortization expense and insurance expense.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products, principally salaries, laboratory testing and supply costs. It also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies, regulatory submissions and costs to register, maintain, and defend our intellectual property, and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property.\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) primarily includes interest income and expense, foreign currency gains (losses), and other miscellaneous gains (losses).\nIncome tax expense. We are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the United States, which include operating losses or profits in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made, and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. Our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income (loss) in the United States and foreign subsidiaries, permanent items, discrete items, unrecognized tax benefits, and amortization of goodwill for U.S tax reporting purposes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales by geography:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asai/Pacific Rim\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales. Net sales increased 11% or $11.7 million to $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales increases were primarily driven by increased sales of our embolectomy catheters of $4.3 million, of which $3.4 million was from our late 2018 acquisition of Syntel and Python products; valvulotomes of $1.6 million, of which $1.2 million was from our Tru-Incise and Chevalier acquisitions in 2019 and 2018, respectively; and polyester grafts of $1.5 million, of which $0.4 million was from Cardial products acquired in late 2018. We also had an increase in human tissue cryopreservation service revenues from our RestoreFlow allograft business of $1.4 million. Our recently acquired CardioCel and VascuCel products contributed combined sales of $1.2 million in 2019. These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 94% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $5.7 million or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $2.6 million, in part due to our acquisition of the Syntel embolectomy catheters, and increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.4 million related to our RestoreFlow allograft business. We also increased sales of valvulotomes by $1.1 million, and our recently acquired CardioCel and VascuCel products contributed sales of $0.9 million in the Americas in 2019. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa net sales increased $4.2 million or 12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of polyester grafts of $1.3 million, embolectomy catheters of $0.8 million, OEM sales of $0.7 million, valvulotomes of $0.6 million and biosynthetic vascular grafts of $0.4 million.\nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $1.8 million or 27% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.9 million, closure systems of $0.3 million, occlusion catheters of $0.2 million and biologic vascular patches of $0.2 million. These and other increases were offset in part by decreased sales of valvulotomes of $0.1 million.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9% </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> * Not applicable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $5.9 million to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while gross margin decreased by 190 basis points to 68.1% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, as well manufacturing efficiencies. These increases were more than offset, however, by an unfavorable product mix, including recently acquired products which typically have a lower gross margin prior to being integrated into our Burlington manufacturing operations. Foreign exchange rate changes also had an unfavorable impact.\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 as a %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 as a %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on divestures and acquisitions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,474 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nSales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales and marketing expense increased $3.0 million, or 11%, to $30.3 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including compensation, commissions and travel expenses associated with expanding our sales force. We also had higher costs due to the implementation of customer relationship software. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expense was 26% in both 2019 and 2018.\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expense increased $1.4 million, or 8%, to $19.1 million. General and administrative expense increases were primarily related to acquisition-related costs including amortization of intangible assets, professional fees, bank and credit card fees, bad debt expense and facilities costs. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense was 16% for 2019 and 17% for 2018.\nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expense increased $1.1 million, or 13%, to $9.3 million. Product development and process engineering increased $0.8 million on a combined basis, in large part due to transitioning certain acquired products to our Burlington manufacturing operations. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $0.3 million, related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. The 2018 gains on divestitures and acquisitions relate to the sale of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Symmetry Surgical, which resulted in a gain of $5.9 million, and also to our purchase of the assets of Cardial, from Becton Dickinson, which resulted in a gain of $1.6 million.\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively for 2019 and 2018. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.2 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $3.7 million on pre-tax income of $21.7 million in 2019 as compared to $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018. The 2019 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.0 million, a state tax provision of $0.4 million, and a foreign tax provision of $1.3 million. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2019 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.4 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\nRefer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income tax expense (benefit) including information related to U.S. tax reform legislation.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales by geography:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asai/Pacific Rim\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales. Net sales increased 5% or $4.7 million to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales increases were primarily driven by increased sales of our biologic vascular patches of $1.7 million, carotid shunts of $1.2 million, embolectomy catheters of $1.2 million, of which $0.8 million was from our recent Syntel acquisition, and valvulotomes of $0.6 million. We also had an increase in human tissue cryopreservation service revenues from our RestoreFlow allograft business of $1.2 million. These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of $1.1 million due to the divestiture of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter product in early Q2 2018 and decreased sales of our closure systems of $0.7 million.\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 93% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.2 million. We also had increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.7 million, in part due to our acquisition of Syntel, as well as increased sales of valvulotomes, carotid shunts and biologic vascular patches of $0.5 million each. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales associated with the divestiture of the Reddick product line of $1.2 million, as well as lower sales of radiopaque tape of $0.5 million and closure systems of $0.4 million.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa net sales increased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of biologic vascular patches of $1.1 million, polyester grafts of $0.4 million, embolectomy catheters of $0.3 million and carotid shunts of $0.2 million. We also had sales of surgical glue of $0.6 million in connection with our recent Cardial acquisition.\nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of carotid shunts of $0.5 million, and embolectomy and occlusion catheters of $0.2 million each, and valvulotomes of $0.1 million each. These increases were offset in part by decreased sales of closure systems to China.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1% </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> * Not applicable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $3.2 million to $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while gross margin decreased by 10 basis points to 70.0% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, a more favorable product mix, including increased sales of our biologic patch products, and the favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. These increases were offset, however, by manufacturing inefficiencies as well as higher manufacturing overhead costs experienced for certain of our product lines.\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 as a %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2017 as a %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on divestures and acquisitions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,474 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,474 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7% </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> * </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,864 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8% </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nSales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales and marketing expense increased $1.4 million, or 5%, to $27.3 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including compensation, recruiting, sales meeting and travel expenses associated with expanding the sales force. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expense was 26% in both 2018 and 2017.\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expense increased $0.7 million, or 4%, to $17.7 million. General and administrative expense increases were primarily related to compensation costs, professional fees and travel expense, offset in part by lower acquisition-related costs and facilities costs. The compensation expense increase in 2018 was in part due to the January 1, 2018 reinstatement of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, which he had forgone (except as to the amount legally required) for the last seven months of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense was 17% for both 2018 and 2017.\nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, research and development expense increased $1.6 million, or 24%, to $8.2 million. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $1.0 million and product development expense increased $0.6 million. These increases were primarily related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. On April 5, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. to sell the inventory, intellectual property and other assets associated with our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines for $7.4 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 we recorded a gain in connection with these agreements of $5.9 million. On October 22, 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of Cardial, a subsidiary of Becton Dickinson, whose business consists of the manufacture and sale of polyester vascular grafts, valvulotomes and surgical glue, for a purchase price of \u20ac1.2 million ($1.4 million). In connection with this asset purchase, we simultaneously entered into an agreement to purchase Cardial's land and building for \u20ac0.8 million ($0.9 million), bringing the total price paid to \u20ac2.0 million ($2.3 million). During the three months ended December 31, 2018 we recorded a bargain purchase gain of \u20ac1.4 million ($1.6 million) in connection with these agreements resulting from the excess value of the assets acquired over the purchase price, subject to finalization of the purchase accounting.\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively for 2018 and 2017. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.4 million and $0.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018 as compared to $3.9 million on pre-tax income of $21.1 million in 2017. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million, and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. The 2017 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.2 million, a state tax provision of $0.7 million and a foreign tax provision of $1.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2018 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.3 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\nRefer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income tax expense (benefit) including information related to U.S. tax reform legislation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $20.9 million in a short-term managed income mutual fund investment, as compared to $26.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.7 million in the mutual fund investment at December 31, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, consist of money market funds, and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Our short-term marketable securities consist of a managed income mutual fund investing mainly in short-term investment grade, U.S.-dollar denominated fixed and floating-rate debt. All of our cash held outside of the United States is available for corporate use, with the exception of $3.3 million held by subsidiaries in jurisdictions for which earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested.\nOn February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 million of the Company's common stock through transactions on the open market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise until February 14, 2020. On February 13, 2020, the Board extended the term of this repurchase program to February 14, 2021. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. To date we have not made any repurchases under this program.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, and pay our long-term liabilities. Since our inception, we have funded our operations through public offerings and private placements of equity securities, short-term and long-term borrowings, and funds generated from our operations.\nWe recognized operating income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents, though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the revenues generated by product sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments associated with our stock repurchase program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future acquisition-related payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments associated with U.S income and other taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs associated with our initiatives to sell direct-to-hospital in new countries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our existing and future products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number, timing, and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations, make acquisitions, make payments under our quarterly dividend program, repurchase shares of our common stock and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow funds from, or establish a revolving credit facility, with a financial institution. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and possibly our ability to pay dividends. We may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nCash Flows\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,100 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,055 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,958 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,622 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,416 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities.

The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in inventory of $11.3 million, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and other current assets of $0.7 million, as well as a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $0.6 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and consisted of $22.9 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $1.7 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.3 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $1.0 million, a benefit for deferred taxes of $2.2 million and gains on acquisitions and divestitures of $7.5 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.7 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, inventory of $4.3 million and other current assets of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $4.3 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted of $17.2 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $7.3 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $0.6 million, and a provision for deferred taxes of $0.3 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.6 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.5 million, inventory of $1.3 million and other current assets of $0.3 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $21.2 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.8 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $12.3 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.1 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by proceeds from the Reddick divestiture of $7.4 million and net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $29.0 million for year ended December 31, 2017, driven by a $22.5 million purchase of a short-term investment, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $6.4 million primarily associated with the clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by payments of common stock dividends of $6.7 million and payments related to our prior acquisitions of $2.1 million.

We also made payments related to our prior acquisitions of $0.4 million.\nDividends. In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a policy for the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The dividend activity for the periods presented is as follows:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Per Share Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dividend Payment\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 22, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> April 5, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 22, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 6, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 21, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> September 5, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,691 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 20, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 5, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 22, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> April 5, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 22, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 7, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 22, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> September 6, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 20, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 6, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 13, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.095 per share payable on March 19, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2020, which will total approximately $1.9 million.\nContractual obligations. Our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5 or\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> or Less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in Burlington, Massachusetts, expiring in 2030, our Sulzbach, Germany office, expiring in 2023, our Hereford, England office, expiring in 2029, our Vaughan, Canada office expiring in 2023, our Tokyo, Japan office, expiring in 2022; and our Shanghai, China office, expiring in 2020. They also include automobile leases. See Note 7 for additional information on these leases.\nWe also have inventory purchase commitments of approximately $1.5 million as of December 31, 2019. These commitments are for product used in operations in the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, sales returns and discounts, and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, and observance of trends in the industry, as appropriate. Different, reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period. Additionally, changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments. Further, we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm. The judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. Those financial estimates and related policies include:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery. We sell primarily directly to hospitals, and to a lesser extent to distributors. We also occasionally enter into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis. Following our acquisition of the RestoreFlow allograft business, we also derive revenues from human tissue cryopreservation services. These service revenues are recognized when services have been provided and the tissue has been shipped to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria discussed below have been met.\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We used the modified retrospective method of adoption under which the comparative information was not restated and will continue to be reported under the standard in effect for those periods. The adoption of this standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings required. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard explains that to achieve the core principle, an entity should take the following actions:\nStep 1: Identify the contract with a customer\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nRevenue is recognized when or as a company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control of that good or service). In instances in which shipping and handling activities are performed after a customer takes control of the goods (such as when title passes upon shipment from our dock), we have made the policy election allowed under Topic 606 to account for these activities as fulfillment costs and not as performance obligations.\nWe generally reference customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a contract. Orders that are not accompanied by a purchase order are confirmed with the customer in writing or verbally. The purchase orders or similar correspondence, once accepted, identify the performance obligations as well as the transaction price, and otherwise outline the rights and obligations of each party. We allocate the transaction price of each contract among the performance obligations in accordance with the pricing of each item specified on the purchase order, which is in turn based on standalone selling prices per our published price lists. In cases where we discount products or provide certain items free of charge, we allocate the discount proportionately to all performance obligations, unless it can be demonstrated that the discount should be allocated entirely to one or more, but not all, of the performance obligations.\nWe recognize revenue, net of allowances for returns and discounts, fees paid to group purchasing organizations, and any sales and value added taxes required to be invoiced, which we have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price as allowed by the standard, at the time of shipment (taking into consideration contractual shipping terms), or in the case of consigned inventory, when it is consumed. Shipment is the point at which control of the product and title passes to our customers, and at which LeMaitre has a present right to receive payment for the goods.\nBelow is a disaggregation of our revenue by major geographic area, which is one of the primary categorizations used by management in evaluating financial performance, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia/Pacific Rim\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcept as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we do not carry any contract assets or contract liabilities, as there are generally no unbilled amounts due from customers under contracts for which we have partially satisfied performance obligations, or amounts received from customers for which we have not satisfied performance obligations. We satisfy our performance obligations under revenue contracts within a short time period from receipt of the orders, and payments from customers are typically received within 30 to 60 days of fulfillment of the orders, except in certain geographies such as Spain and Italy where the payment cycle is customarily longer. Accordingly, there is no significant financing component to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we have elected as a policy that incremental costs (such as commissions) incurred to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred, due to the short-term nature of the contracts.\nCustomers returning products may be entitled to full or partial credit based on the condition and timing of the return. To be accepted, a returned product must be unopened (if sterile), unadulterated, and undamaged, must have at least 18 months remaining prior to its expiration date, or twelve months for our hospital customers in Europe, and generally be returned within 30 days of shipment. These return policies apply to sales to both hospitals and distributors. The amount of products returned to us, either for exchange or credit, has not been material. Nevertheless, we provide for an allowance for future sales returns based on historical return experience, which requires judgment. Our cost of replacing defective products has not been material and is accounted for at the time of replacement.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur accounts receivable are with customers based in the United States and internationally. Accounts receivable generally are due within 30 to 90 days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, other than in certain European markets where longer payment terms are customary and may range from 90 to 240 days. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We continuously monitor aging reports, collections, and payments from customers, and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify.\nWe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our European sales to government-owned or supported customers such as hospitals, distributors and agents in Italy and Spain may be subject to significant payment delays due to government austerity measures impacting funding and payment practices. As of December 31, 2019 our receivables in Italy and Spain totaled $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Receivables balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals and government supported customers in these countries can accumulate over a period of time and then subsequently be settled as large lump sum payments. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of December 31, 2019, if significant changes were to occur in Italy's or Spain's payment practices or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our write offs of uncollectible amounts may increase.\nWe write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances, we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses.\nInventory and Other Deferred Costs\nInventory consists of finished products, work-in-process, and raw materials. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. On a quarterly basis, we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast, which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate, and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Accordingly, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations.\nIn connection with our RestoreFlow allograft business, other deferred costs include costs incurred for the preservation of human vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law human tissues cannot be bought or sold. Therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory, and the costs we incur to procure and process human vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize, as expense, the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. In periods that we grant stock options, fair value assumptions are based on volatility, interest rates, dividend yield, and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company's stock. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing our annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.\nWe also issue restricted stock units (RSUs) as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees, officers, and directors, pursuant to our stockholder-approved Second Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. RSUs entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our Board of Directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company. The fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of RSUs granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Unvested RSUs are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates. RSUs are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We may repurchase common stock upon our employees' vesting in RSUs in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the RSUs having vested.\nAs disclosed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded expense of approximately $2.6 million in connection with share-based payment awards for the year ended December 31, 2019. The future expense of non-vested share-based awards of approximately $10.4 million is to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.8 years. During 2019, we granted stock options at a weighted average fair value of $12.51 and RSUs with weighted average fair value of $35.11. Share-based compensation charges are recorded across the consolidated statement of operations based upon the grantee's primary function.\nValuation of Goodwill, and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Our assessment is performed as of December 31 each year based on a single reporting unit. We first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not\u201d threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If required, the next step of the goodwill impairment test is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination. Specifically, the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Goodwill was $40.0 million and $29.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 16 years. We review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset, or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset, we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period in which it is identified. We generally calculate the fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures, and remaining useful lives of the asset. These estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts. Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $24.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims and assessments for matters related to, among other things, business acquisitions, employment, commercial matters, intellectual property matters, product liability and product recalls. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we were not subject to any material litigation, claims or assessments.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and deferred taxes resulting from the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize, measure, present and disclose in our financial statements, uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOur policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2019 we adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), subsequently amended by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. Under the new guidance, we are required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. As allowed by the standard, we elected to use the transition option not to apply the new lease standard to comparative periods but instead to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption, January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of this standard, we recognized lease liabilities of $7.0 million and right-of-use assets in the amount of $6.5 million (net of the reversal of a previously recorded deferred rent liability of $0.5 million). There was no cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings required. Additional disclosures required under the new standard are included in Note 6 to these financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable, supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and requires judgment in determining relevant information and estimation methods. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements, as the only financial assets we have that are affected by the standard are trade receivables for which we have historically employed a collectability estimation technique.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which, among other provisions, eliminates step 2\u201d from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 as well as clarifying and amending other areas of existing GAAP under Topic 740. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.

These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East and Africa\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia/Pacific Rim\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $12.3 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.1 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by proceeds from the Reddick divestiture of $7.4 million and net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\n * Not applicable \nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nOn February 13, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.095 per share payable on March 19, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2020, which will total approximately $1.9 million.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price\nTo assist us in evaluating our business strategies, we regularly monitor long-term technology trends in peripheral vascular and other device markets. Additionally, we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products, including potential new product launches. We also use this information to help determine our competitive position and our manufacturing capacity requirements.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nHistorically we have experienced success in lower-rivalry niche product segments, for example the markets for valvulotome devices and biologic vascular patches. More recently, however, we have faced increased competition in the biologic vascular patch segment, which has inhibited our ability to continue to increase market share or to implement selling price increases. In the valvulotome market, our highly differentiated devices have historically allowed us to increase our selling prices while maintaining our unit market share. In contrast, we have experienced less success in highly competitive markets such as our ProCol biologic graft product line, where we face strong competition from larger companies with greater resources. While we believe that these challenging market dynamics can be mitigated by our relationships with vascular surgeons, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these highly competitive markets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) primarily includes interest income and expense, foreign currency gains (losses), and other miscellaneous gains (losses).\nOur business opportunities include the following:\n \u2022 In 2019, we launched XenoSure Plus aimed at surgeons who prefer using a biologic patch that is thicker and stiffer than our standard XenoSure patch. \u2022 In 2019, we launched DuraSure, a biologic patch indicated for closing or repairing dural defects in neurosurgical procedures. \n \u2022 In March 2018, we terminated our master distribution agreement with Sinopharm United Medical Device Co., Ltd. (UCMC) under which we sold our powered phlebectomy systems and related disposable devices for distribution in China. In April 2018 we began selling these products to our sub-distributors in China. We repurchased $159,000 of our products from UCMC in 2019. \nOther intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 16 years. We review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset, or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset, we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period in which it is identified. We generally calculate the fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures, and remaining useful lives of the asset. These estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts. Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $24.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa net sales increased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of biologic vascular patches of $1.1 million, polyester grafts of $0.4 million, embolectomy catheters of $0.3 million and carotid shunts of $0.2 million. We also had sales of surgical glue of $0.6 million in connection with our recent Cardial acquisition.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $5.9 million to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while gross margin decreased by 190 basis points to 68.1% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, as well manufacturing efficiencies. These increases were more than offset, however, by an unfavorable product mix, including recently acquired products which typically have a lower gross margin prior to being integrated into our Burlington manufacturing operations. Foreign exchange rate changes also had an unfavorable impact.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018 as compared to $3.9 million on pre-tax income of $21.1 million in 2017. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million, and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. The 2017 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.2 million, a state tax provision of $0.7 million and a foreign tax provision of $1.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2018 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\n \u2022 In November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets related to the peripheral vascular allograft operations of Restore Flow Allografts, LLC for $12.0 million plus additional payments of up to $6.0 million depending upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies. \n\nWe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our European sales to government-owned or supported customers such as hospitals, distributors and agents in Italy and Spain may be subject to significant payment delays due to government austerity measures impacting funding and payment practices. As of December 31, 2019 our receivables in Italy and Spain totaled $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Receivables balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals and government supported customers in these countries can accumulate over a period of time and then subsequently be settled as large lump sum payments. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of December 31, 2019, if significant changes were to occur in Italy's or Spain's payment practices or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our write offs of uncollectible amounts may increase.\nItem 7.\nOur cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations, make acquisitions, make payments under our quarterly dividend program, repurchase shares of our common stock and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow funds from, or establish a revolving credit facility, with a financial institution. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and possibly our ability to pay dividends. We may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nAccounts Receivable\nFluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, affect our financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our sales took place outside the United States, largely in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect foreign currencies will represent a significant percentage of our future sales. Selling, marketing, and administrative costs related to these sales are also denominated in foreign currencies, thereby partially mitigating our bottom-line exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. However, if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for U.S. dollars, it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate increase. In such cases we will receive less revenue in U.S. dollars than we did before the exchange rate changed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales by approximately $2.3 million, as compared to rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $20.9 million in a short-term managed income mutual fund investment, as compared to $26.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.7 million in the mutual fund investment at December 31, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, consist of money market funds, and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Our short-term marketable securities consist of a managed income mutual fund investing mainly in short-term investment grade, U.S.-dollar denominated fixed and floating-rate debt. All of our cash held outside of the United States is available for corporate use, with the exception of $3.3 million held by subsidiaries in jurisdictions for which earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested.\n \u2022 In December 2015, we signed a master distribution agreement with Meheco Yonstron Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Meheco), a Chinese distribution and logistics company, and began selling our Chinese market products to Meheco in 2016. Meheco then sold our products to multiple sub-distributors who then sold to Chinese hospitals. This agreement expired in December 2017, and we are currently in the process of signing distribution agreements with sub-distributors and have begun selling our products to sub-distributors in China. We repurchased $120,000 of our products from Meheco in 2018, which resulted in a corresponding revenue reversal. \n \u2022 During 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with several former Applied Medical and Cardial distributors in Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim in order to terminate their distribution of our recently acquired catheter, polyester graft and valvulotome products, and we began selling direct-to-hospitals in those geographies. The termination fees totaled approximately $0.1 million. \n \u2022 the long-term growth of our direct sales force in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim; \nThe following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses:\nCertain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, and observance of trends in the industry, as appropriate. Different, reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period. Additionally, changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\n \u2022 the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution efforts; \nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.4 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\n</td> </tr>\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $5.7 million or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $2.6 million, in part due to our acquisition of the Syntel embolectomy catheters, and increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.4 million related to our RestoreFlow allograft business. We also increased sales of valvulotomes by $1.1 million, and our recently acquired CardioCel and VascuCel products contributed sales of $0.9 million in the Americas in 2019. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $3.7 million on pre-tax income of $21.7 million in 2019 as compared to $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018. The 2019 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.0 million, a state tax provision of $0.4 million, and a foreign tax provision of $1.3 million. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2019 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, research and development expense increased $1.6 million, or 24%, to $8.2 million. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $1.0 million and product development expense increased $0.6 million. These increases were primarily related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\nWe also have inventory purchase commitments of approximately $1.5 million as of December 31, 2019. These commitments are for product used in operations in the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and consisted of $22.9 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $1.7 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.3 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $1.0 million, a benefit for deferred taxes of $2.2 million and gains on acquisitions and divestitures of $7.5 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.7 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, inventory of $4.3 million and other current assets of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $4.3 million.\n \u2022 payments associated with our stock repurchase program; \nIncome tax expense. We are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the United States, which include operating losses or profits in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made, and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. Our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income (loss) in the United States and foreign subsidiaries, permanent items, discrete items, unrecognized tax benefits, and amortization of goodwill for U.S tax reporting purposes.\n \u2022 the number, timing, and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions. \nNet sales. We derive our net sales from the sale of our products and services, less discounts and returns. Net sales include the shipping and handling fees paid for by our customers. Most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world. In countries where we do not have a direct sales force, sales are primarily to distributors, who in turn sell to hospitals and clinics. In certain cases our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic prior to purchase; in those instances we recognize revenue at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment.\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe are a medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices and implants largely used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. To a lesser extent, our devices also treat cardiovascular disease and are used in neurosurgery applications. We also provide processing and cryopreservation services of peripheral vascular human tissue for implantation into patients. Our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim. We estimate that the annual worldwide market for all of our devices exceeds $5 billion, within which our core product lines address roughly $900 million. We have grown our business using a three-pronged strategy: 1) pursuing a focused call point, 2) competing for sales of low-rivalry niche products, and 3) expanding our worldwide direct sales force while acquiring and developing complementary vascular and other devices. We have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the peripheral vascular device market, and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future. We currently manufacture most of our products in our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\n \u2022 the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development; and \nInventory and Other Deferred Costs\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStock-based Compensation\nNet cash used in investing activities was $29.0 million for year ended December 31, 2017, driven by a $22.5 million purchase of a short-term investment, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $6.4 million primarily associated with the clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\nWe recognize, as expense, the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. In periods that we grant stock options, fair value assumptions are based on volatility, interest rates, dividend yield, and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company's stock. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing our annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.\n\n \u2022 payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders; \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017\nWe generally reference customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a contract. Orders that are not accompanied by a purchase order are confirmed with the customer in writing or verbally. The purchase orders or similar correspondence, once accepted, identify the performance obligations as well as the transaction price, and otherwise outline the rights and obligations of each party. We allocate the transaction price of each contract among the performance obligations in accordance with the pricing of each item specified on the purchase order, which is in turn based on standalone selling prices per our published price lists. In cases where we discount products or provide certain items free of charge, we allocate the discount proportionately to all performance obligations, unless it can be demonstrated that the discount should be allocated entirely to one or more, but not all, of the performance obligations.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\n \u2022 In April 2018, we sold our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. for $7.4 million. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable, supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and requires judgment in determining relevant information and estimation methods. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements, as the only financial assets we have that are affected by the standard are trade receivables for which we have historically employed a collectability estimation technique.\nBelow is a disaggregation of our revenue by major geographic area, which is one of the primary categorizations used by management in evaluating financial performance, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOur principal product lines include the following: valvulotomes, biologic vascular patches, carotid shunts, embolectomy catheters, biologic vascular grafts, anastomotic clips, radiopaque marking tape, powered phlebectomy devices, prosthetic vascular grafts, surgical glue and remote endarterectomy devices. Through our RestoreFlow allografts business we also provide services related to the processing and cryopreservation of human vascular and cardiac tissue.\nWe sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force. As of December 31, 2019 our sales force was comprised of 112 sales representatives in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim, including three export managers, one in each of the three geographic regions. Our worldwide headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and we also have North American sales offices in Chandler, Arizona and Vaughan, Canada. Our European headquarters is located in Sulzbach, Germany, and we also have European sales offices in Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; and Hereford, England. Our Asia/Pacific Rim headquarters is located in Singapore, and we have Asia/Pacific Rim sales offices in Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; and North Melbourne, Australia. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 94% and 95%, respectively, of our net sales were generated in territories in which we employ direct sales representatives. We also sell our products in other countries, including Korea, Russia and Brazil among others, through distributors.\nWe recognized operating income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents, though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries, commissions, stock based compensation, travel and entertainment, attendance at vascular congresses, training programs, advertising and product promotions, direct mail and other marketing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We used the modified retrospective method of adoption under which the comparative information was not restated and will continue to be reported under the standard in effect for those periods. The adoption of this standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings required. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard explains that to achieve the core principle, an entity should take the following actions:\nOn February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 million of the Company's common stock through transactions on the open market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise until February 14, 2020. On February 13, 2020, the Board extended the term of this repurchase program to February 14, 2021. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. To date we have not made any repurchases under this program.\nOur accounts receivable are with customers based in the United States and internationally. Accounts receivable generally are due within 30 to 90 days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, other than in certain European markets where longer payment terms are customary and may range from 90 to 240 days. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We continuously monitor aging reports, collections, and payments from customers, and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInventory consists of finished products, work-in-process, and raw materials. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. On a quarterly basis, we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast, which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate, and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Accordingly, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations.\nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. On April 5, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. to sell the inventory, intellectual property and other assets associated with our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines for $7.4 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 we recorded a gain in connection with these agreements of $5.9 million. On October 22, 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of Cardial, a subsidiary of Becton Dickinson, whose business consists of the manufacture and sale of polyester vascular grafts, valvulotomes and surgical glue, for a purchase price of \u20ac1.2 million ($1.4 million). In connection with this asset purchase, we simultaneously entered into an agreement to purchase Cardial's land and building for \u20ac0.8 million ($0.9 million), bringing the total price paid to \u20ac2.0 million ($2.3 million). During the three months ended December 31, 2018 we recorded a bargain purchase gain of \u20ac1.4 million ($1.6 million) in connection with these agreements resulting from the excess value of the assets acquired over the purchase price, subject to finalization of the purchase accounting.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which, among other provisions, eliminates step 2\u201d from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments. Further, we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm. The judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. Those financial estimates and related policies include:\n\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expense increased $0.7 million, or 4%, to $17.7 million. General and administrative expense increases were primarily related to compensation costs, professional fees and travel expense, offset in part by lower acquisition-related costs and facilities costs. The compensation expense increase in 2018 was in part due to the January 1, 2018 reinstatement of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, which he had forgone (except as to the amount legally required) for the last seven months of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense was 17% for both 2018 and 2017.\n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and deferred taxes resulting from the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nStep 1: Identify the contract with a customer\n\n \u2022 In 2016, we initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the ProCol biologic product line to our facility in Burlington. This transition was completed in 2018. \nWe recognize, measure, present and disclose in our financial statements, uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n \u2022 the consolidation of product manufacturing into our Burlington, Massachusetts corporate headquarters. \nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of carotid shunts of $0.5 million, and embolectomy and occlusion catheters of $0.2 million each, and valvulotomes of $0.1 million each. These increases were offset in part by decreased sales of closure systems to China.\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\n \u2022 In 2017, we renovated our manufacturing facility in Burlington, in which many of our biologic offerings, including the XenoSure patch as well as our ProCol biologic grafts, are produced or processed. The cost of the facility renovation was approximately $3.0 million. \nDividends. In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a policy for the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The dividend activity for the periods presented is as follows:\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $21.2 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.8 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\n \u2022 the addition of complementary products through acquisitions; \n \u2022 In 2018, we expanded the indications for our Anastoclip GC in the United States to include dura tissue repair. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by payments of common stock dividends of $5.4 million and payments related to our prior acquisitions of $1.2 million. We had proceeds from stock option exercises of $3.0 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.7 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings.\nRevenue is recognized when or as a company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control of that good or service). In instances in which shipping and handling activities are performed after a customer takes control of the goods (such as when title passes upon shipment from our dock), we have made the policy election allowed under Topic 606 to account for these activities as fulfillment costs and not as performance obligations.\nContingencies\nIn recent years we have also experienced success in international markets, such as Europe, where we sometimes offer comparatively lower average selling prices. If we continue to seek growth opportunities outside of North America, we may experience downward pressure on our gross margin.\n \u2022 future acquisition-related payments; \n\nSales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales and marketing expense increased $3.0 million, or 11%, to $30.3 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including compensation, commissions and travel expenses associated with expanding our sales force. We also had higher costs due to the implementation of customer relationship software. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expense was 26% in both 2019 and 2018.\nExcept as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we do not carry any contract assets or contract liabilities, as there are generally no unbilled amounts due from customers under contracts for which we have partially satisfied performance obligations, or amounts received from customers for which we have not satisfied performance obligations. We satisfy our performance obligations under revenue contracts within a short time period from receipt of the orders, and payments from customers are typically received within 30 to 60 days of fulfillment of the orders, except in certain geographies such as Spain and Italy where the payment cycle is customarily longer. Accordingly, there is no significant financing component to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we have elected as a policy that incremental costs (such as commissions) incurred to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred, due to the short-term nature of the contracts.\nWe write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances, we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses.\nCustomers returning products may be entitled to full or partial credit based on the condition and timing of the return. To be accepted, a returned product must be unopened (if sterile), unadulterated, and undamaged, must have at least 18 months remaining prior to its expiration date, or twelve months for our hospital customers in Europe, and generally be returned within 30 days of shipment. These return policies apply to sales to both hospitals and distributors. The amount of products returned to us, either for exchange or credit, has not been material. Nevertheless, we provide for an allowance for future sales returns based on historical return experience, which requires judgment. Our cost of replacing defective products has not been material and is accounted for at the time of replacement.\nIn addition to relying upon acquisitions for growth, we also rely on internal product development efforts to bring differentiated technology and next-generation products to market:\nCash Flows\nOur revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery. We sell primarily directly to hospitals, and to a lesser extent to distributors. We also occasionally enter into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis. Following our acquisition of the RestoreFlow allograft business, we also derive revenues from human tissue cryopreservation services. These service revenues are recognized when services have been provided and the tissue has been shipped to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria discussed below have been met.\nOur products are used primarily by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgery and endovascular techniques. In contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists, neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures, vascular surgeons can perform both open surgery and minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide a wider range of treatment options to patients.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products, principally salaries, laboratory testing and supply costs. It also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies, regulatory submissions and costs to register, maintain, and defend our intellectual property, and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property.\nRevenue Recognition\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively for 2019 and 2018. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.2 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n \u2022 payments associated with U.S income and other taxes; \nCost of sales. We manufacture the majority of the products that we sell. Our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel, raw materials and components, depreciation of property and equipment, and other allocated manufacturing overhead, as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers.\nOur execution of these business opportunities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period as we incur related process engineering and other charges.\n \u2022 In 2019, we again built out our biologic manufacturing cleanroom in Burlington so that we can transfer our Omniflow biosynthetic graft from our North Melbourne, Australia facility. We expect this transfer to be completed in 2020. The cost of the buildout was approximately $0.8 million. \nThe commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in Burlington, Massachusetts, expiring in 2030, our Sulzbach, Germany office, expiring in 2023, our Hereford, England office, expiring in 2029, our Vaughan, Canada office expiring in 2023, our Tokyo, Japan office, expiring in 2022; and our Shanghai, China office, expiring in 2020. They also include automobile leases. See Note 7 for additional information on these leases.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims and assessments for matters related to, among other things, business acquisitions, employment, commercial matters, intellectual property matters, product liability and product recalls. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we were not subject to any material litigation, claims or assessments.\n \u2022 In October 2018, we acquired the assets of Cardial, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson & Company, located in Saint-Etienne, France, for \u20ac2.0 million. Cardial's product lines include polyester vascular grafts, valvulotomes and surgical glue. \n</table>\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 94% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $3.2 million to $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while gross margin decreased by 10 basis points to 70.0% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, a more favorable product mix, including increased sales of our biologic patch products, and the favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. These increases were offset, however, by manufacturing inefficiencies as well as higher manufacturing overhead costs experienced for certain of our product lines.\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively for 2018 and 2017. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.4 million and $0.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.3 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\nIn addition to our sales growth strategies, we have also executed several operational initiatives designed to consolidate and streamline manufacturing within our Burlington, Massachusetts facilities. We expect these plant consolidations will result in improved control over our production quality as well as reduced costs over the long-term. Our most recent manufacturing transitions included\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven primarily by proceeds from stock option exercises of $5.5 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.8 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings and by payments of common stock dividends of $4.2 million. We also made payments related to our prior acquisitions of $0.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted of $17.2 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $7.3 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $0.6 million, and a provision for deferred taxes of $0.3 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.6 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.5 million, inventory of $1.3 million and other current assets of $0.3 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nResults of Operations\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and consisted of $17.9 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $10.1 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $5.4 million, stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $1.1 million, a provision for deferred taxes of $0.8 million and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration for acquisitions of $0.2 million, as well as working capital uses of $13.9 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in inventory of $11.3 million, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and other current assets of $0.7 million, as well as a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $0.6 million.\nNet Sales and Expense Components\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 93% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 In July 2019, we entered into an agreement with UreSil, LLC to purchase the remaining assets of their Tru-Incise valve cutter business, including distribution rights in the United States, for $8.0 million. \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by payments of common stock dividends of $6.7 million and payments related to our prior acquisitions of $2.1 million. We had proceeds from stock option exercises of $4.9 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.7 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings.\n * Not applicable \nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. The 2018 gains on divestitures and acquisitions relate to the sale of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Symmetry Surgical, which resulted in a gain of $5.9 million, and also to our purchase of the assets of Cardial, from Becton Dickinson, which resulted in a gain of $1.6 million.\nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $1.8 million or 27% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.9 million, closure systems of $0.3 million, occlusion catheters of $0.2 million and biologic vascular patches of $0.2 million. These and other increases were offset in part by decreased sales of valvulotomes of $0.1 million.\n \u2022 In 2017, we launched a longer version of our Anastoclip AC intended for use in neurosurgery applications. \nWe also issue restricted stock units (RSUs) as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees, officers, and directors, pursuant to our stockholder-approved Second Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. RSUs entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our Board of Directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company. The fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of RSUs granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Unvested RSUs are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates. RSUs are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We may repurchase common stock upon our employees' vesting in RSUs in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the RSUs having vested.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nNet sales. Net sales increased 5% or $4.7 million to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales increases were primarily driven by increased sales of our biologic vascular patches of $1.7 million, carotid shunts of $1.2 million, embolectomy catheters of $1.2 million, of which $0.8 million was from our recent Syntel acquisition, and valvulotomes of $0.6 million. We also had an increase in human tissue cryopreservation service revenues from our RestoreFlow allograft business of $1.2 million. These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of $1.1 million due to the divestiture of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter product in early Q2 2018 and decreased sales of our closure systems of $0.7 million.\n \u2022 In October 2019, we acquired the assets of the CardioCel and VascuCel biologic patch business from Admedus Ltd for $15.5 million plus additional payments of up to $7.8 million depending upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies. \nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019. We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, and pay our long-term liabilities. Since our inception, we have funded our operations through public offerings and private placements of equity securities, short-term and long-term borrowings, and funds generated from our operations.\n \u2022 the revenues generated by product sales; \nStep 5: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.2 million. We also had increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.7 million, in part due to our acquisition of Syntel, as well as increased sales of valvulotomes, carotid shunts and biologic vascular patches of $0.5 million each. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales associated with the divestiture of the Reddick product line of $1.2 million, as well as lower sales of radiopaque tape of $0.5 million and closure systems of $0.4 million.\n \u2022 In September 2018, we acquired the assets of the embolectomy catheter business from Applied Medical Resources Corporation for $14.2 million. We have initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the acquired devices to our Burlington facility. We expect this transition to be completed in 2020. \nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, sales returns and discounts, and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nContractual obligations. Our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 In 2018, we acquired the embolectomy catheter business assets from Applied Medical Resources Corporation. We have initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the acquired devices to our Burlington facility. We expect this transfer to be completed in 2020. \nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expense increased $1.1 million, or 13%, to $9.3 million. Product development and process engineering increased $0.8 million on a combined basis, in large part due to transitioning certain acquired products to our Burlington manufacturing operations. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $0.3 million, related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\n \u2022 the costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our existing and future products; and \nIn connection with our RestoreFlow allograft business, other deferred costs include costs incurred for the preservation of human vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law human tissues cannot be bought or sold. Therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory, and the costs we incur to procure and process human vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred.\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\n\nOn January 1, 2019 we adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), subsequently amended by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. Under the new guidance, we are required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. As allowed by the standard, we elected to use the transition option not to apply the new lease standard to comparative periods but instead to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption, January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of this standard, we recognized lease liabilities of $7.0 million and right-of-use assets in the amount of $6.5 million (net of the reversal of a previously recorded deferred rent liability of $0.5 million). There was no cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings required. Additional disclosures required under the new standard are included in Note 6 to these financial statements.\nValuation of Goodwill, and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Our assessment is performed as of December 31 each year based on a single reporting unit. We first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not\u201d threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If required, the next step of the goodwill impairment test is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination. Specifically, the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Goodwill was $40.0 million and $29.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.", "item_7_text": "Refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income tax expense (benefit) including information related to U.S. tax reform legislation.\nAs disclosed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded expense of approximately $2.6 million in connection with share-based payment awards for the year ended December 31, 2019. The future expense of non-vested share-based awards of approximately $10.4 million is to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.8 years. During 2019, we granted stock options at a weighted average fair value of $12.51 and RSUs with weighted average fair value of $35.11. Share-based compensation charges are recorded across the consolidated statement of operations based upon the grantee's primary function.\nBecause we believe that direct-to-hospital sales engender closer customer relationships, and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins, we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices towards our direct sales organization:\nEurope, Middle East and Africa net sales increased $4.2 million or 12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of polyester grafts of $1.3 million, embolectomy catheters of $0.8 million, OEM sales of $0.7 million, valvulotomes of $0.6 million and biosynthetic vascular grafts of $0.4 million.\n \u2022 the introduction of our products in new territories upon receipt of regulatory approvals or registrations in these territories; \n \u2022 the costs associated with our initiatives to sell direct-to-hospital in new countries; \nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of executive, finance and human resource salaries, stock based compensation, legal and accounting fees, information technology expense, intangible asset amortization expense and insurance expense.\nWe recognize revenue, net of allowances for returns and discounts, fees paid to group purchasing organizations, and any sales and value added taxes required to be invoiced, which we have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price as allowed by the standard, at the time of shipment (taking into consideration contractual shipping terms), or in the case of consigned inventory, when it is consumed. Shipment is the point at which control of the product and title passes to our customers, and at which LeMaitre has a present right to receive payment for the goods.\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expense increased $1.4 million, or 8%, to $19.1 million. General and administrative expense increases were primarily related to acquisition-related costs including amortization of intangible assets, professional fees, bank and credit card fees, bad debt expense and facilities costs. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense was 16% for 2019 and 17% for 2018.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 as well as clarifying and amending other areas of existing GAAP under Topic 740. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies, and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary:\nRefer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income tax expense (benefit) including information related to U.S. tax reform legislation.\nSales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales and marketing expense increased $1.4 million, or 5%, to $27.3 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including compensation, recruiting, sales meeting and travel expenses associated with expanding the sales force. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expense was 26% in both 2018 and 2017.\nNet sales. Net sales increased 11% or $11.7 million to $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales increases were primarily driven by increased sales of our embolectomy catheters of $4.3 million, of which $3.4 million was from our late 2018 acquisition of Syntel and Python products; valvulotomes of $1.6 million, of which $1.2 million was from our Tru-Incise and Chevalier acquisitions in 2019 and 2018, respectively; and polyester grafts of $1.5 million, of which $0.4 million was from Cardial products acquired in late 2018. We also had an increase in human tissue cryopreservation service revenues from our RestoreFlow allograft business of $1.4 million. Our recently acquired CardioCel and VascuCel products contributed combined sales of $1.2 million in 2019. These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nOur policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $12.3 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.1 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by proceeds from the Reddick divestiture of $7.4 million and net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\n * Not applicable \nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nOn February 13, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.095 per share payable on March 19, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2020, which will total approximately $1.9 million.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price\nTo assist us in evaluating our business strategies, we regularly monitor long-term technology trends in peripheral vascular and other device markets. Additionally, we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products, including potential new product launches. We also use this information to help determine our competitive position and our manufacturing capacity requirements.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nHistorically we have experienced success in lower-rivalry niche product segments, for example the markets for valvulotome devices and biologic vascular patches. More recently, however, we have faced increased competition in the biologic vascular patch segment, which has inhibited our ability to continue to increase market share or to implement selling price increases. In the valvulotome market, our highly differentiated devices have historically allowed us to increase our selling prices while maintaining our unit market share. In contrast, we have experienced less success in highly competitive markets such as our ProCol biologic graft product line, where we face strong competition from larger companies with greater resources. While we believe that these challenging market dynamics can be mitigated by our relationships with vascular surgeons, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these highly competitive markets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther income (expense). Other income (expense) primarily includes interest income and expense, foreign currency gains (losses), and other miscellaneous gains (losses).\nOur business opportunities include the following:\n \u2022 In 2019, we launched XenoSure Plus aimed at surgeons who prefer using a biologic patch that is thicker and stiffer than our standard XenoSure patch. \u2022 In 2019, we launched DuraSure, a biologic patch indicated for closing or repairing dural defects in neurosurgical procedures. \n \u2022 In March 2018, we terminated our master distribution agreement with Sinopharm United Medical Device Co., Ltd. (UCMC) under which we sold our powered phlebectomy systems and related disposable devices for distribution in China. In April 2018 we began selling these products to our sub-distributors in China. We repurchased $159,000 of our products from UCMC in 2019. \nOther intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 16 years. We review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset, or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset, we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period in which it is identified. We generally calculate the fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures, and remaining useful lives of the asset. These estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts. Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $24.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa net sales increased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of biologic vascular patches of $1.1 million, polyester grafts of $0.4 million, embolectomy catheters of $0.3 million and carotid shunts of $0.2 million. We also had sales of surgical glue of $0.6 million in connection with our recent Cardial acquisition.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $5.9 million to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while gross margin decreased by 190 basis points to 68.1% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, as well manufacturing efficiencies. These increases were more than offset, however, by an unfavorable product mix, including recently acquired products which typically have a lower gross margin prior to being integrated into our Burlington manufacturing operations. Foreign exchange rate changes also had an unfavorable impact.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018 as compared to $3.9 million on pre-tax income of $21.1 million in 2017. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million, and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. The 2017 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.2 million, a state tax provision of $0.7 million and a foreign tax provision of $1.0 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2018 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\n \u2022 In November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets related to the peripheral vascular allograft operations of Restore Flow Allografts, LLC for $12.0 million plus additional payments of up to $6.0 million depending upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies. \n\nWe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our European sales to government-owned or supported customers such as hospitals, distributors and agents in Italy and Spain may be subject to significant payment delays due to government austerity measures impacting funding and payment practices. As of December 31, 2019 our receivables in Italy and Spain totaled $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Receivables balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals and government supported customers in these countries can accumulate over a period of time and then subsequently be settled as large lump sum payments. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of December 31, 2019, if significant changes were to occur in Italy's or Spain's payment practices or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our write offs of uncollectible amounts may increase.\nItem 7.\nOur cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations, make acquisitions, make payments under our quarterly dividend program, repurchase shares of our common stock and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow funds from, or establish a revolving credit facility, with a financial institution. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and possibly our ability to pay dividends. We may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nAccounts Receivable\nFluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, affect our financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our sales took place outside the United States, largely in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect foreign currencies will represent a significant percentage of our future sales. Selling, marketing, and administrative costs related to these sales are also denominated in foreign currencies, thereby partially mitigating our bottom-line exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. However, if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for U.S. dollars, it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate increase. In such cases we will receive less revenue in U.S. dollars than we did before the exchange rate changed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales by approximately $2.3 million, as compared to rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2019, we held $11.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $20.9 million in a short-term managed income mutual fund investment, as compared to $26.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.7 million in the mutual fund investment at December 31, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, consist of money market funds, and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Our short-term marketable securities consist of a managed income mutual fund investing mainly in short-term investment grade, U.S.-dollar denominated fixed and floating-rate debt. All of our cash held outside of the United States is available for corporate use, with the exception of $3.3 million held by subsidiaries in jurisdictions for which earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested.\n \u2022 In December 2015, we signed a master distribution agreement with Meheco Yonstron Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Meheco), a Chinese distribution and logistics company, and began selling our Chinese market products to Meheco in 2016. Meheco then sold our products to multiple sub-distributors who then sold to Chinese hospitals. This agreement expired in December 2017, and we are currently in the process of signing distribution agreements with sub-distributors and have begun selling our products to sub-distributors in China. We repurchased $120,000 of our products from Meheco in 2018, which resulted in a corresponding revenue reversal. \n \u2022 During 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with several former Applied Medical and Cardial distributors in Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim in order to terminate their distribution of our recently acquired catheter, polyester graft and valvulotome products, and we began selling direct-to-hospitals in those geographies. The termination fees totaled approximately $0.1 million. \n \u2022 the long-term growth of our direct sales force in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim; \nThe following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses:\nCertain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, and observance of trends in the industry, as appropriate. Different, reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period. Additionally, changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.\n \u2022 the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution efforts; \nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2019, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.4 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\n</td> </tr>\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $5.7 million or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $2.6 million, in part due to our acquisition of the Syntel embolectomy catheters, and increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.4 million related to our RestoreFlow allograft business. We also increased sales of valvulotomes by $1.1 million, and our recently acquired CardioCel and VascuCel products contributed sales of $0.9 million in the Americas in 2019. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of powered phlebectomy systems of $0.8 million.\nIncome tax expense. We recorded a provision for taxes of $3.7 million on pre-tax income of $21.7 million in 2019 as compared to $5.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.4 million in 2018. The 2019 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.0 million, a state tax provision of $0.4 million, and a foreign tax provision of $1.3 million. The 2018 provision was comprised of a federal tax provision in the United States of $2.8 million, a state tax provision of $0.5 million and a foreign tax provision of $2.2 million. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate in 2019 principally because of stock option exercises, taxes on foreign earnings, valuation allowances, and certain permanent differences. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies.\nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, research and development expense increased $1.6 million, or 24%, to $8.2 million. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $1.0 million and product development expense increased $0.6 million. These increases were primarily related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\nWe also have inventory purchase commitments of approximately $1.5 million as of December 31, 2019. These commitments are for product used in operations in the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and consisted of $22.9 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $1.7 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.3 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $1.0 million, a benefit for deferred taxes of $2.2 million and gains on acquisitions and divestitures of $7.5 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.7 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, inventory of $4.3 million and other current assets of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $4.3 million.\n \u2022 payments associated with our stock repurchase program; \nIncome tax expense. We are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the United States, which include operating losses or profits in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made, and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. Our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income (loss) in the United States and foreign subsidiaries, permanent items, discrete items, unrecognized tax benefits, and amortization of goodwill for U.S tax reporting purposes.\n \u2022 the number, timing, and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions. \nNet sales. We derive our net sales from the sale of our products and services, less discounts and returns. Net sales include the shipping and handling fees paid for by our customers. Most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world. In countries where we do not have a direct sales force, sales are primarily to distributors, who in turn sell to hospitals and clinics. In certain cases our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic prior to purchase; in those instances we recognize revenue at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment.\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe are a medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices and implants largely used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. To a lesser extent, our devices also treat cardiovascular disease and are used in neurosurgery applications. We also provide processing and cryopreservation services of peripheral vascular human tissue for implantation into patients. Our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim. We estimate that the annual worldwide market for all of our devices exceeds $5 billion, within which our core product lines address roughly $900 million. We have grown our business using a three-pronged strategy: 1) pursuing a focused call point, 2) competing for sales of low-rivalry niche products, and 3) expanding our worldwide direct sales force while acquiring and developing complementary vascular and other devices. We have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the peripheral vascular device market, and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future. We currently manufacture most of our products in our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\n \u2022 the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development; and \nInventory and Other Deferred Costs\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStock-based Compensation\nNet cash used in investing activities was $29.0 million for year ended December 31, 2017, driven by a $22.5 million purchase of a short-term investment, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $6.4 million primarily associated with the clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters.\nWe recognize, as expense, the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. In periods that we grant stock options, fair value assumptions are based on volatility, interest rates, dividend yield, and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company's stock. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing our annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.\n\n \u2022 payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders; \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017\nWe generally reference customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a contract. Orders that are not accompanied by a purchase order are confirmed with the customer in writing or verbally. The purchase orders or similar correspondence, once accepted, identify the performance obligations as well as the transaction price, and otherwise outline the rights and obligations of each party. We allocate the transaction price of each contract among the performance obligations in accordance with the pricing of each item specified on the purchase order, which is in turn based on standalone selling prices per our published price lists. In cases where we discount products or provide certain items free of charge, we allocate the discount proportionately to all performance obligations, unless it can be demonstrated that the discount should be allocated entirely to one or more, but not all, of the performance obligations.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\n \u2022 In April 2018, we sold our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. for $7.4 million. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable, supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and requires judgment in determining relevant information and estimation methods. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements, as the only financial assets we have that are affected by the standard are trade receivables for which we have historically employed a collectability estimation technique.\nBelow is a disaggregation of our revenue by major geographic area, which is one of the primary categorizations used by management in evaluating financial performance, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOur principal product lines include the following: valvulotomes, biologic vascular patches, carotid shunts, embolectomy catheters, biologic vascular grafts, anastomotic clips, radiopaque marking tape, powered phlebectomy devices, prosthetic vascular grafts, surgical glue and remote endarterectomy devices. Through our RestoreFlow allografts business we also provide services related to the processing and cryopreservation of human vascular and cardiac tissue.\nWe sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force. As of December 31, 2019 our sales force was comprised of 112 sales representatives in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific Rim, including three export managers, one in each of the three geographic regions. Our worldwide headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and we also have North American sales offices in Chandler, Arizona and Vaughan, Canada. Our European headquarters is located in Sulzbach, Germany, and we also have European sales offices in Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; and Hereford, England. Our Asia/Pacific Rim headquarters is located in Singapore, and we have Asia/Pacific Rim sales offices in Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; and North Melbourne, Australia. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 94% and 95%, respectively, of our net sales were generated in territories in which we employ direct sales representatives. We also sell our products in other countries, including Korea, Russia and Brazil among others, through distributors.\nWe recognized operating income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents, though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries, commissions, stock based compensation, travel and entertainment, attendance at vascular congresses, training programs, advertising and product promotions, direct mail and other marketing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We used the modified retrospective method of adoption under which the comparative information was not restated and will continue to be reported under the standard in effect for those periods. The adoption of this standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings required. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard explains that to achieve the core principle, an entity should take the following actions:\nOn February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 million of the Company's common stock through transactions on the open market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise until February 14, 2020. On February 13, 2020, the Board extended the term of this repurchase program to February 14, 2021. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. To date we have not made any repurchases under this program.\nOur accounts receivable are with customers based in the United States and internationally. Accounts receivable generally are due within 30 to 90 days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, other than in certain European markets where longer payment terms are customary and may range from 90 to 240 days. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We continuously monitor aging reports, collections, and payments from customers, and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInventory consists of finished products, work-in-process, and raw materials. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. On a quarterly basis, we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast, which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand. Our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate, and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Accordingly, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations.\nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. On April 5, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Specialty Surgical Instrumentation, Inc. to sell the inventory, intellectual property and other assets associated with our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines for $7.4 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 we recorded a gain in connection with these agreements of $5.9 million. On October 22, 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of Cardial, a subsidiary of Becton Dickinson, whose business consists of the manufacture and sale of polyester vascular grafts, valvulotomes and surgical glue, for a purchase price of \u20ac1.2 million ($1.4 million). In connection with this asset purchase, we simultaneously entered into an agreement to purchase Cardial's land and building for \u20ac0.8 million ($0.9 million), bringing the total price paid to \u20ac2.0 million ($2.3 million). During the three months ended December 31, 2018 we recorded a bargain purchase gain of \u20ac1.4 million ($1.6 million) in connection with these agreements resulting from the excess value of the assets acquired over the purchase price, subject to finalization of the purchase accounting.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which, among other provisions, eliminates step 2\u201d from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments. Further, we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm. The judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. Those financial estimates and related policies include:\n\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expense increased $0.7 million, or 4%, to $17.7 million. General and administrative expense increases were primarily related to compensation costs, professional fees and travel expense, offset in part by lower acquisition-related costs and facilities costs. The compensation expense increase in 2018 was in part due to the January 1, 2018 reinstatement of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, which he had forgone (except as to the amount legally required) for the last seven months of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense was 17% for both 2018 and 2017.\n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and deferred taxes resulting from the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nStep 1: Identify the contract with a customer\n\n \u2022 In 2016, we initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the ProCol biologic product line to our facility in Burlington. This transition was completed in 2018. \nWe recognize, measure, present and disclose in our financial statements, uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n \u2022 the consolidation of product manufacturing into our Burlington, Massachusetts corporate headquarters. \nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales of carotid shunts of $0.5 million, and embolectomy and occlusion catheters of $0.2 million each, and valvulotomes of $0.1 million each. These increases were offset in part by decreased sales of closure systems to China.\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\n \u2022 In 2017, we renovated our manufacturing facility in Burlington, in which many of our biologic offerings, including the XenoSure patch as well as our ProCol biologic grafts, are produced or processed. The cost of the facility renovation was approximately $3.0 million. \nDividends. In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a policy for the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The dividend activity for the periods presented is as follows:\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cash paid for acquisitions of $21.2 million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of $3.8 million primarily associated with clean room build-outs at our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters. These investments were in part offset by net sales of short-term investments of $0.9 million.\n \u2022 the addition of complementary products through acquisitions; \n \u2022 In 2018, we expanded the indications for our Anastoclip GC in the United States to include dura tissue repair. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by payments of common stock dividends of $5.4 million and payments related to our prior acquisitions of $1.2 million. We had proceeds from stock option exercises of $3.0 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.7 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings.\nRevenue is recognized when or as a company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control of that good or service). In instances in which shipping and handling activities are performed after a customer takes control of the goods (such as when title passes upon shipment from our dock), we have made the policy election allowed under Topic 606 to account for these activities as fulfillment costs and not as performance obligations.\nContingencies\nIn recent years we have also experienced success in international markets, such as Europe, where we sometimes offer comparatively lower average selling prices. If we continue to seek growth opportunities outside of North America, we may experience downward pressure on our gross margin.\n \u2022 future acquisition-related payments; \n\nSales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales and marketing expense increased $3.0 million, or 11%, to $30.3 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, including compensation, commissions and travel expenses associated with expanding our sales force. We also had higher costs due to the implementation of customer relationship software. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expense was 26% in both 2019 and 2018.\nExcept as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we do not carry any contract assets or contract liabilities, as there are generally no unbilled amounts due from customers under contracts for which we have partially satisfied performance obligations, or amounts received from customers for which we have not satisfied performance obligations. We satisfy our performance obligations under revenue contracts within a short time period from receipt of the orders, and payments from customers are typically received within 30 to 60 days of fulfillment of the orders, except in certain geographies such as Spain and Italy where the payment cycle is customarily longer. Accordingly, there is no significant financing component to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we have elected as a policy that incremental costs (such as commissions) incurred to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred, due to the short-term nature of the contracts.\nWe write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances, we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses.\nCustomers returning products may be entitled to full or partial credit based on the condition and timing of the return. To be accepted, a returned product must be unopened (if sterile), unadulterated, and undamaged, must have at least 18 months remaining prior to its expiration date, or twelve months for our hospital customers in Europe, and generally be returned within 30 days of shipment. These return policies apply to sales to both hospitals and distributors. The amount of products returned to us, either for exchange or credit, has not been material. Nevertheless, we provide for an allowance for future sales returns based on historical return experience, which requires judgment. Our cost of replacing defective products has not been material and is accounted for at the time of replacement.\nIn addition to relying upon acquisitions for growth, we also rely on internal product development efforts to bring differentiated technology and next-generation products to market:\nCash Flows\nOur revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery. We sell primarily directly to hospitals, and to a lesser extent to distributors. We also occasionally enter into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis. Following our acquisition of the RestoreFlow allograft business, we also derive revenues from human tissue cryopreservation services. These service revenues are recognized when services have been provided and the tissue has been shipped to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria discussed below have been met.\nOur products are used primarily by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgery and endovascular techniques. In contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists, neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures, vascular surgeons can perform both open surgery and minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide a wider range of treatment options to patients.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense includes costs associated with the design, development, testing, enhancement and regulatory approval of our products, principally salaries, laboratory testing and supply costs. It also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies, regulatory submissions and costs to register, maintain, and defend our intellectual property, and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property.\nRevenue Recognition\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively for 2019 and 2018. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.2 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n \u2022 payments associated with U.S income and other taxes; \nCost of sales. We manufacture the majority of the products that we sell. Our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel, raw materials and components, depreciation of property and equipment, and other allocated manufacturing overhead, as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers.\nOur execution of these business opportunities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period as we incur related process engineering and other charges.\n \u2022 In 2019, we again built out our biologic manufacturing cleanroom in Burlington so that we can transfer our Omniflow biosynthetic graft from our North Melbourne, Australia facility. We expect this transfer to be completed in 2020. The cost of the buildout was approximately $0.8 million. \nThe commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in Burlington, Massachusetts, expiring in 2030, our Sulzbach, Germany office, expiring in 2023, our Hereford, England office, expiring in 2029, our Vaughan, Canada office expiring in 2023, our Tokyo, Japan office, expiring in 2022; and our Shanghai, China office, expiring in 2020. They also include automobile leases. See Note 7 for additional information on these leases.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims and assessments for matters related to, among other things, business acquisitions, employment, commercial matters, intellectual property matters, product liability and product recalls. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we were not subject to any material litigation, claims or assessments.\n \u2022 In October 2018, we acquired the assets of Cardial, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson & Company, located in Saint-Etienne, France, for \u20ac2.0 million. Cardial's product lines include polyester vascular grafts, valvulotomes and surgical glue. \n</table>\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 94% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $3.2 million to $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while gross margin decreased by 10 basis points to 70.0% in the period. The gross margin was favorably impacted by higher average selling prices across most product lines, a more favorable product mix, including increased sales of our biologic patch products, and the favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. These increases were offset, however, by manufacturing inefficiencies as well as higher manufacturing overhead costs experienced for certain of our product lines.\nOther income (expense). Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively for 2018 and 2017. Foreign exchange losses on settlements or remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were $0.4 million and $0.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.3 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to Australian net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards and Massachusetts tax credit carry forwards that are not expected to be realized.\nIn addition to our sales growth strategies, we have also executed several operational initiatives designed to consolidate and streamline manufacturing within our Burlington, Massachusetts facilities. We expect these plant consolidations will result in improved control over our production quality as well as reduced costs over the long-term. Our most recent manufacturing transitions included\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven primarily by proceeds from stock option exercises of $5.5 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.8 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings and by payments of common stock dividends of $4.2 million. We also made payments related to our prior acquisitions of $0.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted of $17.2 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $7.3 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $0.6 million, and a provision for deferred taxes of $0.3 million), as well as working capital uses of $1.6 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable of $1.5 million, inventory of $1.3 million and other current assets of $0.3 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nResults of Operations\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and consisted of $17.9 million net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $10.1 million (including primarily depreciation and amortization of $5.4 million, stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, provisions for inventory write-offs and doubtful accounts of $1.1 million, a provision for deferred taxes of $0.8 million and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration for acquisitions of $0.2 million, as well as working capital uses of $13.9 million. The net cash used for working capital was driven by increases in inventory of $11.3 million, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and other current assets of $0.7 million, as well as a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $0.6 million.\nNet Sales and Expense Components\nDirect-to-hospital net sales were 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 93% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 In July 2019, we entered into an agreement with UreSil, LLC to purchase the remaining assets of their Tru-Incise valve cutter business, including distribution rights in the United States, for $8.0 million. \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by payments of common stock dividends of $6.7 million and payments related to our prior acquisitions of $2.1 million. We had proceeds from stock option exercises of $4.9 million, offset by the acquisition of $0.7 million of treasury shares to cover minimum withholding taxes on restricted stock unit vestings.\n * Not applicable \nGain on divestitures and acquisitions. The 2018 gains on divestitures and acquisitions relate to the sale of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter and Reddick-Saye screw product lines to Symmetry Surgical, which resulted in a gain of $5.9 million, and also to our purchase of the assets of Cardial, from Becton Dickinson, which resulted in a gain of $1.6 million.\nAsia/Pacific Rim net sales increased $1.8 million or 27% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.9 million, closure systems of $0.3 million, occlusion catheters of $0.2 million and biologic vascular patches of $0.2 million. These and other increases were offset in part by decreased sales of valvulotomes of $0.1 million.\n \u2022 In 2017, we launched a longer version of our Anastoclip AC intended for use in neurosurgery applications. \nWe also issue restricted stock units (RSUs) as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees, officers, and directors, pursuant to our stockholder-approved Second Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. RSUs entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our Board of Directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company. The fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of RSUs granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Unvested RSUs are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates. RSUs are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We may repurchase common stock upon our employees' vesting in RSUs in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the RSUs having vested.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nNet sales. Net sales increased 5% or $4.7 million to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales increases were primarily driven by increased sales of our biologic vascular patches of $1.7 million, carotid shunts of $1.2 million, embolectomy catheters of $1.2 million, of which $0.8 million was from our recent Syntel acquisition, and valvulotomes of $0.6 million. We also had an increase in human tissue cryopreservation service revenues from our RestoreFlow allograft business of $1.2 million. These and other product line increases were partially offset by decreased sales of $1.1 million due to the divestiture of our Reddick cholangiogram catheter product in early Q2 2018 and decreased sales of our closure systems of $0.7 million.\n \u2022 In October 2019, we acquired the assets of the CardioCel and VascuCel biologic patch business from Admedus Ltd for $15.5 million plus additional payments of up to $7.8 million depending upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies. \nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019. We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, and pay our long-term liabilities. Since our inception, we have funded our operations through public offerings and private placements of equity securities, short-term and long-term borrowings, and funds generated from our operations.\n \u2022 the revenues generated by product sales; \nStep 5: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nNet sales by geography. Net sales in the Americas increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased human tissue cryopreservation services of $1.2 million. We also had increased sales of embolectomy catheters of $0.7 million, in part due to our acquisition of Syntel, as well as increased sales of valvulotomes, carotid shunts and biologic vascular patches of $0.5 million each. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales associated with the divestiture of the Reddick product line of $1.2 million, as well as lower sales of radiopaque tape of $0.5 million and closure systems of $0.4 million.\n \u2022 In September 2018, we acquired the assets of the embolectomy catheter business from Applied Medical Resources Corporation for $14.2 million. We have initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the acquired devices to our Burlington facility. We expect this transition to be completed in 2020. \nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, sales returns and discounts, and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nContractual obligations. Our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments under operating leases as of December 31, 2019:\n \u2022 In 2018, we acquired the embolectomy catheter business assets from Applied Medical Resources Corporation. We have initiated a project to transfer the manufacturing of the acquired devices to our Burlington facility. We expect this transfer to be completed in 2020. \nResearch and development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expense increased $1.1 million, or 13%, to $9.3 million. Product development and process engineering increased $0.8 million on a combined basis, in large part due to transitioning certain acquired products to our Burlington manufacturing operations. Clinical and regulatory expenses increased $0.3 million, related to regulatory submissions for new products in geographies such as China and Japan, and testing related to our biologic product offerings.\n \u2022 the costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our existing and future products; and \nIn connection with our RestoreFlow allograft business, other deferred costs include costs incurred for the preservation of human vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law human tissues cannot be bought or sold. Therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory, and the costs we incur to procure and process human vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred.\n* Not a meaningful percentage.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percentage increase or decrease:\n\nOn January 1, 2019 we adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), subsequently amended by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. Under the new guidance, we are required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. As allowed by the standard, we elected to use the transition option not to apply the new lease standard to comparative periods but instead to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption, January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of this standard, we recognized lease liabilities of $7.0 million and right-of-use assets in the amount of $6.5 million (net of the reversal of a previously recorded deferred rent liability of $0.5 million). There was no cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings required. Additional disclosures required under the new standard are included in Note 6 to these financial statements.\nValuation of Goodwill, and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. Our assessment is performed as of December 31 each year based on a single reporting unit. We first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not\u201d threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If required, the next step of the goodwill impairment test is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination. Specifically, the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Goodwill was $40.0 million and $29.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.", "item_7_tables": "Table 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
