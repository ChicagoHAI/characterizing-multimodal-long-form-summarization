AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations and our wholly-owned subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central nervous system, or CNS. ITI-007 is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that, we believe, may represent an effective treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, ITI-007 combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or DPPM, glutamatergic modulation, and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. At dopamine D2 receptors, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist. ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic NMDA GluN2B receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner. We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic interactions, may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved psychosocial function. The serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism, and other CNS diseases. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Schizophrenia\nIn September 2015, we announced top-line clinical results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 12 sites in the United States with 450 patients randomized (1:1:1) to receive either 60 mg of ITI-007, 40 mg of ITI-007 or placebo once daily in the morning for 28 days. The pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint (4 weeks) on the centrally rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. In this trial, the once-daily dose of 60 mg of ITI-007 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy with statistically significant superiority over placebo at week 4 (study endpoint) with additional improvements observed in social function. Moreover, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 showed significant antipsychotic efficacy as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the entire study. ITI-007 showed a dose-related improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with the 40 mg dose approximating the trajectory of improvement seen with the 60 mg dose, but the effect with 40 mg did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. In addition, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 met the key secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Illness, or CGI-S. The 40 mg dose of ITI-007 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the CGI-S, though not formally tested against placebo as a key\nsecondary endpoint since it did not separate on the primary endpoint. Consistent with previous studies, ITI-007 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as evidenced by motoric, metabolic, and cardiovascular characteristics similar to placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids.\nIn September 2015, we also announced top-line data from an open-label positron emission tomography, or PET, study of ITI-007 examining brain occupancy of striatal D2 receptors. This study was conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were otherwise healthy and stable with respect to their psychosis. After washout from their previous antipsychotic medication for at least two weeks, PET was used to determine target occupancy in brain regions at baseline (drug-free) and again after two weeks of once daily ITI-007 oral administration. In this trial, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 was associated with a mean of approximately 40% striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. As predicted by preclinical and earlier clinical data, ITI-007 demonstrated antipsychotic effect at relatively low striatal D2 receptor occupancy, lower than the occupancy range required by most other antipsychotic drugs. Unlike any existing schizophrenia treatment, this dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator, or DPPM, acts as a pre-synaptic partial agonist and post-synaptic antagonist at D2 receptors. We believe this mechanism likely contributes to the favorable safety profile of ITI-007, with reduced risk for hyperprolactinemia, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and other motoric side effects.\nThe top-line results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 confirm the earlier Phase 2 results that we announced in December 2013, in which ITI-007 exhibited antipsychotic efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in patients with an acutely exacerbated episode of schizophrenia. In this Phase 2 trial, 335 patients were randomized to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, orally once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In this study, ITI-007 met the trial's pre-specified primary endpoint, improving symptoms associated with schizophrenia as measured by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the PANSS total score. The trial also met key secondary outcome measures related to efficacy on PANSS subscales and safety. We are also conducting a second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second quarter of 2015, with over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the trial. In this trial, we are randomizing patients to two doses of ITI-007 (60 mg or 20 mg), risperidone (active control) or placebo over a 6-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 42 on the PANSS total score. We expect patient enrollment will be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Subject to timely enrollment, we anticipate top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available in mid-2016.\nIn addition to our two Phase 3 clinical trials, we will need to complete other clinical and non-clinical trials and manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities necessary to support the submission of a planned NDA for ITI-007 in schizophrenia, which we currently expect could occur in the first half of 2017.\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Depression)\nOur bipolar depression program consists of two Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: one to evaluate ITI-007 as a monotherapy and the other to evaluate ITI-007 as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In each trial, approximately 550 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing a current major depressive episode will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 40 mg ITI-007, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio orally once daily for 6 weeks. In the ITI-007-401 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo as a monotherapy. In the ITI-007-402 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo adjunctive to their existing mood stabilizer lithium or valproate. We initiated our bipolar depression program in the third quarter of 2015.\nThe primary endpoint for both clinical trials is change from baseline at Day 42 on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, orMADRS, total score versus placebo. The MADRS is a well-validated 10-item checklist that measures the ability of a drug to reduce overall severity of depressive symptoms. Individual items\nare rated by an expert clinician on a scale of 0 to 6 in which a score of 6 represents the most depressed evaluation for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. Secondary endpoints include measures of social function and quality of life that may illustrate the differentiated clinical profile of ITI-007. Safety and tolerability are also assessed in both clinical trials.\nOther Indications for ITI-007\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses. We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate additional late phase clinical programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, in the first half of 2016.\nWe are also pursuing clinical development of ITI-007 for the treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders. At the lowest doses, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to act primarily as a potent 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist. As the dose is increased, additional benefits are derived from the engagement of additional drug targets, including modest dopamine receptor modulation and modest inhibition of serotonin transporters. We believe that combined interactions at these receptors may provide additional benefits above and beyond selective 5-HT2A antagonism for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, while avoiding many of the side effects associated with more robust dopamine receptor antagonism. As the dose of ITI-007 is further increased, leading to moderate dopamine receptor modulation, inhibition of serotonin transporters, and indirect glutamate modulation, these actions complement the complete blockade of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. At a dose of 60 mg, ITI-007 has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we believe this higher dose range will be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases.\nGiven the potential utility for ITI-007 and follow-on compounds to treat these additional indications, we may investigate, either on our own or with a partner, agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in additional diseases that include autism spectrum disorders; depressive disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; non-motor symptoms and motor complications associated with Parkinson's disease; and post-traumatic stress disorder. We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to ITI-007 and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company pursuant to an exclusive license.\nOther Product Candidates\nWe have a second major program called ITI-002 that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. We believe PDE1 helps regulate brain activity related to cognition, memory processes and movement/coordination. On February 25, 2011, we (through our wholly owned operating subsidiary, ITI) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Takeda License Agreement, under which we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize our proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 for use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. On October 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Takeda terminating the Takeda License Agreement, or the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which all rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to us. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for ITI-214 to us. ITI-214 is\nthe first compound in its class to successfully advance into Phase 1 clinical trials. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson's disease, cognition in Alzheimer's disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Other compounds in the PDE portfolio are also being advanced for the treatment of various indications.\nOur pipeline also includes pre-clinical programs that are focused on advancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We are also investigating the development of treatments for disease modification of neurodegenerative disorders and non-CNS diseases.\nWe have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery and development of our product candidates. We complement our management team with a group of scientific and clinical advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of schizophrenia and other CNS disorders, including Nobel laureate, Dr. Paul Greengard, one of our co-founders.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to our research and development activities. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $193.0 million. We expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates and programs. Our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nOur corporate headquarters and laboratory are located in New York, New York.\nPublic Offerings in March 2015 and September 2015\nOn March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million, and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed a public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $43.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our financial statements.\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been from a government grant and the residual reimbursement of expenses from the terminated Takeda License Agreement. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been from the terminated Takeda License Agreement and to a much lesser extent from a government grant. We will not receive any further revenue under the Takeda License Agreement, which was terminated on October 31, 2014. We have received and may continue to receive grants from U.S. government agencies and foundations.\nWe do not expect any revenues that we may generate in the next several years to be significant enough to fund our operations.\nExpenses\nThe process of researching and developing drugs for human use is lengthy, unpredictable and subject to many risks. We are unable with any certainty to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those costs will be incurred. The clinical development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression consumes and will continue to consume a large portion of our current, as well as projected, resources. We intend to pursue other disease indications that ITI-007 may address, but there are significant costs associated with pursuing FDA approval for those indications, which would include the cost of additional clinical trials.\nOur ITI-002 program has a compound, ITI-214, in Phase 1 development. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson's disease, cognition in Alzheimer's disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Our other projects are still in the pre-clinical stages, and will require extensive funding not only to complete pre-clinical testing, but to enter into and complete clinical trials. Expenditures that we incur on these projects will be subject to availability of funding in addition to the funding required for the advancement of ITI-007. Any failure or delay in the advancement of ITI-007 could require us to re-allocate resources from our other projects to the advancement of ITI-007, which could have a significant material adverse impact on the advancement of these other projects and on our results of operations. Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. Our research and development costs are comprised of:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>internal recurring costs, such as labor and fringe benefits, materials and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and related testing, clinical trial activities and license milestone payments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses are incurred in three major categories:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>salaries and related benefit costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>patent, legal and professional costs; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>office and facilities overhead. </td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that research and development expenses will increase substantially as we proceed with our Phase 3 clinical trials for ITI-007 in patients with exacerbated schizophrenia and our Phase 3 clinical trials for ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder. We also expect that our general and administrative costs will increase substantially from prior periods primarily due to costs to perform pre-product commercialization activities and the increased costs associated with being a public reporting entity, which could include adding additional personnel. We granted options to purchase 884,703 shares of our common stock in 2015 and have granted options to purchase an additional 347,137 shares of our common stock in January 2016. We also granted restricted stock units for 5,272 and 78,806 shares of our common stock in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. We will recognize expense associated with these restricted stock units and options over the next three years in both research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. We expect this non-cash expense to be material and affect quarter to quarter and year to date comparisons in the upcoming year. We expect to continue to grant stock options and other stock-based awards in the future, which will increase our stock-based compensation expense in future periods.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, operating expenses, interest income (expense) and income taxes expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,737 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,976 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income (Expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(583 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(104,793 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,691 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,868 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $485.9 thousand, or 84%, primarily due to reimbursable costs paid to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement which terminated on October 31, 2014 with limited reimbursements in 2015, offset by slightly higher revenue in 2015 from a government grant.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $66.5 million, or 313%. This change is due primarily to an increase of approximately $47.1 million of costs associated with outside clinical testing and an increase of approximately $14.9 million from nonclinical testing in the year ended December 31, 2015 over the year ended December 31, 2014. The vast majority of the increase is due to costs associated with conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical program in schizophrenia. In late 2014, we began a clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia and incurred the majority of the costs for this trial in 2015. In addition, we started our second Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia in June 2015 and incurred significant costs for this trial in the second half of 2015. In December 2015, we commenced our Phase 3 clinical trials in bipolar disorder and have incurred approximately $3.6 million in costs through December 31, 2015. In 2014, we did not incur significant costs related to clinical trials. Amounts paid to external parties comprise a large portion of our research and development costs. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred approximately $76.8 million of costs to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial related activities as compared to $16.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Of these external costs, approximately $76.1 million in the year ended December 30, 2015 and $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were for ITI-007 related projects. The remaining amounts for each of these periods were spent on other projects. Internal costs are comprised primarily of labor, fringe benefits, materials, supplies and facilities and maintenance costs and were approximately $10.9 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in these internal costs is due primarily to hiring additional research and development employees in 2015 in addition to increased stock based compensation expense.\nAs development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia progresses, we anticipate costs for that program to increase considerably in the next several years as we continue to conduct Phase 3 and other clinical trials. We are also required to complete non-clinical testing to obtain FDA approval and manufacture material needed for clinical trial use, which includes non-clinical testing of the drug product and the creation of an inventory of drug product in anticipation of possible FDA approval. In addition we plan to spend increasing amounts to further our development of ITI-007 for other indications, including but not limited to, the treatment of\ndepressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression), for treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, and for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, among other indications.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed 24 full time personnel in our research and development group as compared to 16 full time personnel at December 31, 2014. We expect to hire additional staff as we increase our development efforts and grow our business in the upcoming years.\nWe currently have several projects, in addition to ITI-007, that are in the research and development stages, including in the areas of cognitive dysfunction and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, among others. We have used internal resources and incurred expenses not only in relation to the development of ITI-007, but also in connection with these additional projects as well. We have not, however, reported these costs on a project by project basis, as these costs are broadly spread among these projects. The external costs for these projects have been minimal and are reflected in the amounts discussed in this section \u201c-Research and Development Expenses.\u201d\nDuring previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $30,700 and $14,000, respectively, of costs that were billable to Takeda pursuant to ongoing obligations under the termination agreement. We do not expect to incur material costs going forward under this agreement.\nThe research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. This process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites to assure that data supporting the safety and effectiveness of product candidates has been generated in compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development of our product candidates and the approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective, will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval, or will be granted marketing approval on a timely basis, if at all. Data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval or could result in label warnings related to or recalls of approved products.\nWe, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our product candidates. Other risks associated with our product candidates are described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.8 million, or 76%, primarily due to approximately $4.1 million of higher stock option expense and to a much lesser extent to increased bonus and labor costs and state and local franchise and capital taxes. Salaries, bonuses and related benefit costs for our executive, finance and administrative functions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 59% and 49%, respectively, of our total general and administrative costs. Our other general and administrative expenses include patent costs, legal, accounting and other professional fees and, to a lesser extent, facilities and general office-related overhead.\nWe expect general and administrative costs to increase significantly as we hire additional staff, expand our operations, including initial preparation for potential commercial activities, and incur additional costs associated with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in addition to being a public company and complying with exchange listing and SEC requirements, including the additional complexities and related costs of our transition at the end of 2015 from an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d to a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC. These increases could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated with investor relations activities, among others.\nInterest Income\nInterest income has increased to approximately $1.0 million from $304,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily a result of higher than average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014 which is due to the net offering proceeds of $121.8 million that we received in March 2015 and $327.4 million that we received in September 2015.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nRevenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $2.2 million, or 79%, due primarily to the recognition in 2013 of previously deferred revenue relating to the Takeda License Agreement and lower reimbursable costs payable to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement, offset to a much lesser extent by revenue from a government grant in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.8 million, or 8%. This decrease is due primarily to costs associated with outside clinical testing for our ITI-007 Phase 2 clinical trial that was completed in late 2013 as compared to costs incurred in conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical trial, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease were expenses of approximately $6.6 million incurred in 2014 as compared to $1.9 million in 2013 related to the manufacturing and other clinical and non-clinical testing of our ITI-007 product candidate and expenses of approximately $1.9 million related to our ITI-007-200 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy geriatric and dementia patients incurred only in 2014. In addition, stock option expense increased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to stock options granted in 2014.\nThe research and development expenses incurred for amounts payable to external parties comprised a significant portion of our research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We incurred expenses of approximately $14.8 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for amounts payable to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial activities for all of our projects. We spent approximately $14.4 million and $18.3 million on external costs for the development of ITI-007 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the same periods, our internal research and development expenses for all projects were approximately $5.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The clinical development work related to ITI-007 requires the largest portion of our resources and, consequently, comprises the majority of our spending. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred total expenses of $18.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively, for all ITI-007 related projects and $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for all of our other projects. Total research and development expenses were approximately $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $23.0 million for 2013.\nDuring 2014 and in previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred approximately $14,000 on direct costs that were billable to Takeda as compared to $97,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $4.4 million, or 73%. This increase was primarily due to increased stock option expense of $1.7 million in 2014 related to options granted in 2014, and increased labor and related benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million, with the remainder comprised of higher professional fees, directors' and officers' insurance costs, and board of directors compensation fees, which are due to the activities associated with being a public company. We expect these costs to increase significantly as we expand our operations, including hiring of additional personnel, continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of being a public company and issue additional equity incentive awards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThrough December 31, 2015, we provided funds for our operations by obtaining approximately $716.3 million of cash primarily through public and private offerings of our common stock and other securities, grants from government agencies and foundations and payments received under the terminated Takeda License Agreement. We do not believe that grant revenue will be a significant source of funding in the near future, and Takeda has limited ongoing funding obligations following the termination of the Takeda License Agreement on October 31, 2014. On March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed an additional public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a total of approximately $475.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, and approximately $6.3 million of short-term liabilities consisting entirely of liabilities from operations. Excluding the increase in net cash of approximately $121.8 million and $327.4 million from the public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, respectively, we spent approximately $103.1 million in cash for operations and equipment and we reduced working capital by approximately $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This use of cash was primarily for conducting clinical trials and non-clinical testing, including manufacturing related activities and funding recurring operating expenses.\nFor the year 2016, we expect to spend between approximately $130 million and $160 million. We expect these expenditures to be due primarily to the development of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances in dementia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorders, our ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development, research and preclinical development of our other product candidates, the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007, recurring expenses and costs to produce, develop and validate materials to be used in clinical and non-clinical studies related to ITI-007, and expenses associated with our other development programs and general operations. We expect that cash expenditures will continue to increase after 2016 as we further expand the ITI-007 clinical stage programs, the ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; the continuation of manufacturing, pre-commercial activities in connection with the development of ITI-007 and the early stage pre-commercial launch activities for ITI-007. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of 2018.\nWe will require significant additional financing in the future to continue to fund our operations. We believe that we have the funding in place to complete the additional clinical and non-clinical trials, manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities needed for potential regulatory approval and commercialization of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia. With the remaining proceeds from our public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, we believe that we have the funds to complete our proposed clinical trials of ITI-007 in bipolar disorder as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We will also be funding clinical trials of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia; preclinical and clinical development of ITI-007 long acting injectable development program; additional clinical trials of ITI-007; continued clinical development of our PDE program, including ITI-214; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; and the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007. We anticipate requiring additional funds to obtain regulatory approval for ITI-007 in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, for further development of ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other indications, and for development of our other product candidates. We have incurred losses in every year since inception with the exception of 2011, when we received an up-front fee and a milestone payment related to the Takeda License Agreement. These losses have resulted in significant cash used in operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used net cash in operating activities and purchases of equipment of approximately $103.1 million and expect to use additional cash of between approximately $130 and $160 million through the end of 2016. While we have several research and development programs underway, the ITI-007 program has advanced the furthest and will continue to consume increasing amounts of cash for conducting clinical trials and the testing and manufacturing of product material. As we continue to conduct the activities necessary to pursue FDA approval of ITI-007 and our other product candidates, we expect the amount of cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.\nWith the termination of the Takeda License Agreement in October 2014, we will not receive milestone payments and only limited expense reimbursements, including patent filing costs, from Takeda and will be responsible for the costs of developing ITI-214. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the IND for ITI-214 to us. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE1 program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, but we do not anticipate a significant increase in our operating expenses related to our PDE development programs through at least the first half of 2016.\nWe seek to balance the level of cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms. Until we can generate significant revenues from operations, we will need to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private sales of our equity securities, sales of debt securities, the incurrence of debt from commercial lenders, strategic collaborations, licensing a portion or all of our product candidates and technology and, to a lesser extent, grant funding.\nWe cannot be sure that future funding will be available to us when we need it on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs. The amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock or other securities depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, the status and progress of our product development programs, projected cash needs, availability of funding from other sources, our stock price and the status of the capital markets. Due to the volatile nature of the financial markets, equity and debt financing may be difficult to obtain. In addition, any unfavorable development or delay in the progress of our ITI-007 program could have a material adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: (1) delay, limit, reduce or terminate pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates, including our lead product candidate ITI-007, ITI-214, and our other pre-clinical stage product candidates; (2) delay, limit, reduce or terminate our discovery research or pre-clinical development activities; or (3) enter into licenses or other arrangements with third parties on terms that may be unfavorable to us or sell, license or relinquish rights to develop or commercialize our product candidates, technologies or intellectual property at an earlier stage of development and on less favorable terms than we would otherwise agree.\nOur cash is maintained in checking accounts, money market accounts, money market mutual funds, U.S. government agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes and corporate bonds at major financial institutions. Due to the current low interest rates available for these instruments, we are earning limited interest income. We do not expect interest income to be a significant source of funding over the next several quarters. Our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the problems in the credit markets that have existed over the last several years, but there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future.\nIn 2014, we entered into a long-term lease, which was amended in December 2015, for 16,753 square feet of useable laboratory and office space located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York 10016. Due to the amortization of total lease payments, we have recognized $1.6 million of deferred rent in the year ended December 31, 2015. The deferred rent balance will incrementally increase over approximately the next year. We occupied these facilities as our headquarters in March 2015, replacing our previous laboratories and offices. The lease, as amended, has a term of 12 years. We expect that our facility related costs will increase moderately as a result of leasing this facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTotal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The table of Contractual Obligations and Commitments does not reflect that, under the License Agreement with BMS, we may be obligated to make future milestone payments to BMS totaling $12 million; to make other future milestone payments to BMS for each licensed product of up to an aggregate of approximately $14.75 million; to make tiered single digit percentage royalty payments on sales of licensed products; and to pay BMS a percentage of non-royalty payments made in consideration of any sublicense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from those estimates and under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all terms and conditions of the agreements have been met, including that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We are reimbursed for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants, collaboration agreements, and awards. We record the amount of reimbursement as revenues on a gross basis in accordance with ASC Topic 605-45, Revenue Recognition/Principal Agent Considerations. We are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, are obligated to compensate the service provider for the work performed, and have discretion in selecting the supplier. Provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period such losses are determined.\nWe have entered into arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element. Each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us, this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has \u201cstand-alone value\u201d to the customer. We adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis for all Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or MDRAs, entered into on or after January 1, 2011, and for any MDRAs that were entered into prior to January 1, 2011, but materially modified on or after that date.\nThe adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, or on our financial positions as of those dates.\nWe have adopted ASC Topic 605-28, Milestone Method. Under this guidance, we recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period the milestone is achieved. Substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the milestone payments are non-refundable; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a reasonable amount of time passes between the up-front license payment and the first milestone payment, as well as between each subsequent milestone payment. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management's judgment. If any of these conditions are not met, the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone, and therefore, the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportional performance or straight-line methods, as applicable. In addition, the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and, as a result, any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportional performance or straight-line methods, as applicable.\nResearch and Development\nExcept for payments made in advance of services, the Company expenses its research and development costs as incurred. For payments made in advance, the Company recognizes research and development expense as the services are rendered. Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel and resources and the costs of clinical trials. Other research and development expenses include preclinical analytical testing, outside services, providers, materials and consulting fees.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company's objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The\nCompany determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The Company's clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in it reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based payments in the form of options are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The fair value of share-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, or the Black-Scholes model. The resulting fair value is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the option. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.\nFor all awards granted with time-based vesting conditions, expense is amortized using the straight-line attribution method. For awards that contain a performance-based vesting condition, expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is based on share-based awards ultimately expected to vest, and this amount has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting forfeitures for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were estimated based on our historical experience and have not been material.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes model for estimating fair value of our stock options granted. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require the input of subjective assumptions, and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and the expected life of the award. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.\nExpected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable publicly traded entities and other factors due to the limited historical information about our common stock. The expected life of stock options is the period of time for which the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Given the limited historical exercise data, the expected life is determined using the \u201csimplified method,\u201d which is defined as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term.\nThe risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. We have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend rate of zero.\nPrior to January 1, 2014, given that there was no active market for our common stock, the exercise price of the stock options on the date of grant was determined and approved by the board of directors using several factors, including progress and milestones achieved in our business development and performance, the price per share of our convertible preferred stock offerings and general industry and economic trends. In establishing the estimated fair value of our common stock, we considered the guidance set forth in American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants Practice Guide, \u201cValuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d For stock options granted in 2014 and 2015, the exercise price was determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nUnder ASC Topic 718, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized for instruments classified as equity that ordinarily would result in a future tax deduction under existing tax law shall be considered to be a deductible difference in applying ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The deductible temporary difference is based on the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. However, these provisions currently do not impact us, as all the deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance.\nSince we had net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no excess tax benefits for the tax deductions related to share-based awards were recognized in the statements of operations.\nEquity instruments issued to non-employees are accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 718 and ASC Topic 505-50, Equity/Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed and are marked to market during the service period.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update as of the fourth quarter of 2015, retrospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction-specific and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018, with an option that permits companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Presently, we are assessing what effect the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Not applicable.\nPublic Accountants Practice Guide, \u201cValuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d For stock options granted in 2014 and 2015, the exercise price was determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our expectations regarding the additional management attention and costs that will be required as we transition from an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d to a \u201clarge accelerated filer;\u201d and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, operating expenses, interest income (expense) and income taxes expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n \u2022 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; \n\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development of our product candidates and the approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and is uncertain and subject to a number of risks.

In this Phase 2 trial, 335 patients were randomized to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, orally once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In this study, ITI-007 met the trial's pre-specified primary endpoint, improving symptoms associated with schizophrenia as measured by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the PANSS total score. The trial also met key secondary outcome measures related to efficacy on PANSS subscales and safety. We are also conducting a second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second quarter of 2015, with over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the trial. In this trial, we are randomizing patients to two doses of ITI-007 (60 mg or 20 mg), risperidone (active control) or placebo over a 6-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 42 on the PANSS total score. We expect patient enrollment will be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Subject to timely enrollment, we anticipate top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available in mid-2016.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our exposure to investment risk, interest rate risk and capital market risk; </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone; \nWe have adopted ASC Topic 605-28, Milestone Method.

With the remaining proceeds from our public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, we believe that we have the funds to complete our proposed clinical trials of ITI-007 in bipolar disorder as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We will also be funding clinical trials of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia; preclinical and clinical development of ITI-007 long acting injectable development program; additional clinical trials of ITI-007; continued clinical development of our PDE program, including ITI-214; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; and the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007. We anticipate requiring additional funds to obtain regulatory approval for ITI-007 in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, for further development of ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other indications, and for development of our other product candidates. We have incurred losses in every year since inception with the exception of 2011, when we received an up-front fee and a milestone payment related to the Takeda License Agreement. These losses have resulted in significant cash used in operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used net cash in operating activities and purchases of equipment of approximately $103.1 million and expect to use additional cash of between approximately $130 and $160 million through the end of 2016. While we have several research and development programs underway, the ITI-007 program has advanced the furthest and will continue to consume increasing amounts of cash for conducting clinical trials and the testing and manufacturing of product material. As we continue to conduct the activities necessary to pursue FDA approval of ITI-007 and our other product candidates, we expect the amount of cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>any restrictions on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the rate and degree of market acceptance of any future products; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based payments in the form of options are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.

ITI-007 is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that, we believe, may represent an effective treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, ITI-007 combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or DPPM, glutamatergic modulation, and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. At dopamine D2 receptors, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist. ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic NMDA GluN2B receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner. We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic interactions, may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved psychosocial function. The serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism, and other CNS diseases. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are incurred in three major categories:\ndepressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression), for treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, and for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, among other indications.\nCompany determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the services completed.

The Company's clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in it reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nDetermination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management's judgment.

In addition, the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and, as a result, any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportional performance or straight-line methods, as applicable.\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our ability to obtain future reimbursement and/or milestone payments from our collaborators; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPART II\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $4.4 million, or 73%. This increase was primarily due to increased stock option expense of $1.7 million in 2014 related to options granted in 2014, and increased labor and related benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million, with the remainder comprised of higher professional fees, directors' and officers' insurance costs, and board of directors compensation fees, which are due to the activities associated with being a public company. We expect these costs to increase significantly as we expand our operations, including hiring of additional personnel, continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of being a public company and issue additional equity incentive awards.\nAs development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia progresses, we anticipate costs for that program to increase considerably in the next several years as we continue to conduct Phase 3 and other clinical trials. We are also required to complete non-clinical testing to obtain FDA approval and manufacture material needed for clinical trial use, which includes non-clinical testing of the drug product and the creation of an inventory of drug product in anticipation of possible FDA approval. In addition we plan to spend increasing amounts to further our development of ITI-007 for other indications, including but not limited to, the treatment of\nWe are also pursuing clinical development of ITI-007 for the treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders. At the lowest doses, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to act primarily as a potent 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist. As the dose is increased, additional benefits are derived from the engagement of additional drug targets, including modest dopamine receptor modulation and modest inhibition of serotonin transporters. We believe that combined interactions at these receptors may provide additional benefits above and beyond selective 5-HT2A antagonism for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, while avoiding many of the side effects associated with more robust dopamine receptor antagonism. As the dose of ITI-007 is further increased, leading to moderate dopamine receptor modulation, inhibition of serotonin transporters, and indirect glutamate modulation, these actions complement the complete blockade of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. At a dose of 60 mg, ITI-007 has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we believe this higher dose range will be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; </td> </tr>\n</table>\n Item 7.

Our other projects are still in the pre-clinical stages, and will require extensive funding not only to complete pre-clinical testing, but to enter into and complete clinical trials. Expenditures that we incur on these projects will be subject to availability of funding in addition to the funding required for the advancement of ITI-007. Any failure or delay in the advancement of ITI-007 could require us to re-allocate resources from our other projects to the advancement of ITI-007, which could have a significant material adverse impact on the advancement of these other projects and on our results of operations.

Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update as of the fourth quarter of 2015, retrospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our ability to attract and retain key scientific or management personnel. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince we had net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no excess tax benefits for the tax deductions related to share-based awards were recognized in the statements of operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our ability to obtain additional financing; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $2.2 million, or 79%, due primarily to the recognition in 2013 of previously deferred revenue relating to the Takeda License Agreement and lower reimbursable costs payable to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement, offset to a much lesser extent by revenue from a government grant in 2014.\n \u2022 fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and related testing, clinical trial activities and license milestone payments. \nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our plans to research, develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery and development of our product candidates.

Individual items\nExpenses\nUse of Proceeds from Registered Securities\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.8 million, or 76%, primarily due to approximately $4.1 million of higher stock option expense and to a much lesser extent to increased bonus and labor costs and state and local franchise and capital taxes. Salaries, bonuses and related benefit costs for our executive, finance and administrative functions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 59% and 49%, respectively, of our total general and administrative costs. Our other general and administrative expenses include patent costs, legal, accounting and other professional fees and, to a lesser extent, facilities and general office-related overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been from a government grant and the residual reimbursement of expenses from the terminated Takeda License Agreement. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been from the terminated Takeda License Agreement and to a much lesser extent from a government grant. We will not receive any further revenue under the Takeda License Agreement, which was terminated on October 31, 2014. We have received and may continue to receive grants from U.S. government agencies and foundations.\nWe received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $115.4 million, after deducting approximately $7.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions, and approximately $0.8 million of offering expenses payable by us. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were incurred or paid to our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates.\nThe risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. We have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend rate of zero.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses. We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate additional late phase clinical programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, in the first half of 2016.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\n Not applicable.\nGiven the potential utility for ITI-007 and follow-on compounds to treat these additional indications, we may investigate, either on our own or with a partner, agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in additional diseases that include autism spectrum disorders; depressive disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; non-motor symptoms and motor complications associated with Parkinson's disease; and post-traumatic stress disorder. We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to ITI-007 and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company pursuant to an exclusive license.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to our research and development activities. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $193.0 million. We expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates and programs. Our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nIf adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: (1) delay, limit, reduce or terminate pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates, including our lead product candidate ITI-007, ITI-214, and our other pre-clinical stage product candidates; (2) delay, limit, reduce or terminate our discovery research or pre-clinical development activities; or (3) enter into licenses or other arrangements with third parties on terms that may be unfavorable to us or sell, license or relinquish rights to develop or commercialize our product candidates, technologies or intellectual property at an earlier stage of development and on less favorable terms than we would otherwise agree.\n \u2022 submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all clinical trials; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we have used the net proceeds of the offering primarily for working capital purposes, including recurring expenses and preclinical and clinical trial costs related to the development of ITI-007.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from those estimates and under different assumptions or conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed 24 full time personnel in our research and development group as compared to 16 full time personnel at December 31, 2014. We expect to hire additional staff as we increase our development efforts and grow our business in the upcoming years.\nNot applicable.\nResults of Operations\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nare rated by an expert clinician on a scale of 0 to 6 in which a score of 6 represents the most depressed evaluation for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. Secondary endpoints include measures of social function and quality of life that may illustrate the differentiated clinical profile of ITI-007. Safety and tolerability are also assessed in both clinical trials.\nInterest income has increased to approximately $1.0 million from $304,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily a result of higher than average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014 which is due to the net offering proceeds of $121.8 million that we received in March 2015 and $327.4 million that we received in September 2015.\nDuring previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $30,700 and $14,000, respectively, of costs that were billable to Takeda pursuant to ongoing obligations under the termination agreement. We do not expect to incur material costs going forward under this agreement.\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations and our wholly-owned subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn 2014, we entered into a long-term lease, which was amended in December 2015, for 16,753 square feet of useable laboratory and office space located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York 10016. Due to the amortization of total lease payments, we have recognized $1.6 million of deferred rent in the year ended December 31, 2015. The deferred rent balance will incrementally increase over approximately the next year. We occupied these facilities as our headquarters in March 2015, replacing our previous laboratories and offices. The lease, as amended, has a term of 12 years. We expect that our facility related costs will increase moderately as a result of leasing this facility.\n \u2022 achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; \nOther Indications for ITI-007\nOur bipolar depression program consists of two Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: one to evaluate ITI-007 as a monotherapy and the other to evaluate ITI-007 as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In each trial, approximately 550 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing a current major depressive episode will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 40 mg ITI-007, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio orally once daily for 6 weeks. In the ITI-007-401 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo as a monotherapy. In the ITI-007-402 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo adjunctive to their existing mood stabilizer lithium or valproate. We initiated our bipolar depression program in the third quarter of 2015.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nthe first compound in its class to successfully advance into Phase 1 clinical trials. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson's disease, cognition in Alzheimer's disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Other compounds in the PDE portfolio are also being advanced for the treatment of various indications.\nThe research and development expenses incurred for amounts payable to external parties comprised a significant portion of our research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We incurred expenses of approximately $14.8 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for amounts payable to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial activities for all of our projects. We spent approximately $14.4 million and $18.3 million on external costs for the development of ITI-007 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the same periods, our internal research and development expenses for all projects were approximately $5.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The clinical development work related to ITI-007 requires the largest portion of our resources and, consequently, comprises the majority of our spending. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred total expenses of $18.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively, for all ITI-007 related projects and $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for all of our other projects. Total research and development expenses were approximately $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $23.0 million for 2013.\n\nRevenues\nThe research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. This process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:\n \nYou should read this report and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed as exhibits to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report, and we do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 the milestone payments are non-refundable; \nsecondary endpoint since it did not separate on the primary endpoint. Consistent with previous studies, ITI-007 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as evidenced by motoric, metabolic, and cardiovascular characteristics similar to placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nItem 7 as well as other sections in this report, discuss some of the factors that could contribute to these differences. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about:\n \u2022 salaries and related benefit costs; \n Stockholders\n\nWe have a second major program called ITI-002 that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. We believe PDE1 helps regulate brain activity related to cognition, memory processes and movement/coordination. On February 25, 2011, we (through our wholly owned operating subsidiary, ITI) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Takeda License Agreement, under which we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize our proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 for use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. On October 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Takeda terminating the Takeda License Agreement, or the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which all rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to us. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for ITI-214 to us. ITI-214 is\n Our headquarters are located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York 10016, where we occupy approximately 16,753 square feet of useable office and laboratory space. The term of the lease, as amended, expires January 31, 2027. We also lease office space in Towson, Maryland on a month to month basis.\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, we also announced top-line data from an open-label positron emission tomography, or PET, study of ITI-007 examining brain occupancy of striatal D2 receptors. This study was conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were otherwise healthy and stable with respect to their psychosis. After washout from their previous antipsychotic medication for at least two weeks, PET was used to determine target occupancy in brain regions at baseline (drug-free) and again after two weeks of once daily ITI-007 oral administration. In this trial, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 was associated with a mean of approximately 40% striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. As predicted by preclinical and earlier clinical data, ITI-007 demonstrated antipsychotic effect at relatively low striatal D2 receptor occupancy, lower than the occupancy range required by most other antipsychotic drugs. Unlike any existing schizophrenia treatment, this dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator, or DPPM, acts as a pre-synaptic partial agonist and post-synaptic antagonist at D2 receptors. We believe this mechanism likely contributes to the favorable safety profile of ITI-007, with reduced risk for hyperprolactinemia, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and other motoric side effects.\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company's objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $485.9 thousand, or 84%, primarily due to reimbursable costs paid to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement which terminated on October 31, 2014 with limited reimbursements in 2015, offset by slightly higher revenue in 2015 from a government grant.\n \u2022 internal recurring costs, such as labor and fringe benefits, materials and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs; and \nWe do not expect any revenues that we may generate in the next several years to be significant enough to fund our operations.\nFrom December 20, 2013 through January 30, 2014, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Markets-OTCQB tier, or OTCQB, under the symbol \u201cITCI.\u201d On January 31, 2014, our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cITCI\u201d and ceased being quoted on the OTCQB. The high and low bid quotations per share of our common stock as reported by the OTCQB and the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by NASDAQ for the applicable periods when the common stock was quoted on the OTCBB or listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, as applicable, since the common stock commenced public trading are set forth below:\nOur cash is maintained in checking accounts, money market accounts, money market mutual funds, U.S. government agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes and corporate bonds at major financial institutions. Due to the current low interest rates available for these instruments, we are earning limited interest income. We do not expect interest income to be a significant source of funding over the next several quarters. Our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the problems in the credit markets that have existed over the last several years, but there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future.\nWe currently have several projects, in addition to ITI-007, that are in the research and development stages, including in the areas of cognitive dysfunction and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, among others. We have used internal resources and incurred expenses not only in relation to the development of ITI-007, but also in connection with these additional projects as well. We have not, however, reported these costs on a project by project basis, as these costs are broadly spread among these projects. The external costs for these projects have been minimal and are reflected in the amounts discussed in this section \u201c-Research and Development Expenses.\u201d\nOn March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million, and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed a public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $43.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Schizophrenia\n \u2022 FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. \nPublic Offerings in March 2015 and September 2015\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Depression)\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nResearch and development expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $66.5 million, or 313%. This change is due primarily to an increase of approximately $47.1 million of costs associated with outside clinical testing and an increase of approximately $14.9 million from nonclinical testing in the year ended December 31, 2015 over the year ended December 31, 2014. The vast majority of the increase is due to costs associated with conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical program in schizophrenia. In late 2014, we began a clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia and incurred the majority of the costs for this trial in 2015. In addition, we started our second Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia in June 2015 and incurred significant costs for this trial in the second half of 2015. In December 2015, we commenced our Phase 3 clinical trials in bipolar disorder and have incurred approximately $3.6 million in costs through December 31, 2015. In 2014, we did not incur significant costs related to clinical trials. Amounts paid to external parties comprise a large portion of our research and development costs. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred approximately $76.8 million of costs to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial related activities as compared to $16.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Of these external costs, approximately $76.1 million in the year ended December 30, 2015 and $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were for ITI-007 related projects. The remaining amounts for each of these periods were spent on other projects. Internal costs are comprised primarily of labor, fringe benefits, materials, supplies and facilities and maintenance costs and were approximately $10.9 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in these internal costs is due primarily to hiring additional research and development employees in 2015 in addition to increased stock based compensation expense.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur corporate headquarters and laboratory are located in New York, New York.\nIn addition to our two Phase 3 clinical trials, we will need to complete other clinical and non-clinical trials and manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities necessary to support the submission of a planned NDA for ITI-007 in schizophrenia, which we currently expect could occur in the first half of 2017.\nWith the termination of the Takeda License Agreement in October 2014, we will not receive milestone payments and only limited expense reimbursements, including patent filing costs, from Takeda and will be responsible for the costs of developing ITI-214. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the IND for ITI-214 to us. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE1 program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, but we do not anticipate a significant increase in our operating expenses related to our PDE development programs through at least the first half of 2016.\nAs of February 25, 2016, we had 43,202,709 outstanding shares of common stock and no outstanding shares of preferred stock. As of February 25, 2016, there were approximately 125 holders of record of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nPrior to January 1, 2014, given that there was no active market for our common stock, the exercise price of the stock options on the date of grant was determined and approved by the board of directors using several factors, including progress and milestones achieved in our business development and performance, the price per share of our convertible preferred stock offerings and general industry and economic trends. In establishing the estimated fair value of our common stock, we considered the guidance set forth in American Institute of Certified\nFor the year 2016, we expect to spend between approximately $130 million and $160 million. We expect these expenditures to be due primarily to the development of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances in dementia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorders, our ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development, research and preclinical development of our other product candidates, the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007, recurring expenses and costs to produce, develop and validate materials to be used in clinical and non-clinical studies related to ITI-007, and expenses associated with our other development programs and general operations. We expect that cash expenditures will continue to increase after 2016 as we further expand the ITI-007 clinical stage programs, the ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; the continuation of manufacturing, pre-commercial activities in connection with the development of ITI-007 and the early stage pre-commercial launch activities for ITI-007. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of 2018.\n \u2022 patent, legal and professional costs; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our product candidates. Other risks associated with our product candidates are described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity instruments issued to non-employees are accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 718 and ASC Topic 505-50, Equity/Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed and are marked to market during the service period.\nRevenue is recognized when all terms and conditions of the agreements have been met, including that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We are reimbursed for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants, collaboration agreements, and awards. We record the amount of reimbursement as revenues on a gross basis in accordance with ASC Topic 605-45, Revenue Recognition/Principal Agent Considerations. We are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, are obligated to compensate the service provider for the work performed, and have discretion in selecting the supplier. Provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period such losses are determined.\n\nwe make. We have included important cautionary statements in this report, particularly in the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make.\n We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements\nResearch and Development\nThe adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, or on our financial positions as of those dates.\nRevenue Recognition\n\n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nThrough December 31, 2015, we provided funds for our operations by obtaining approximately $716.3 million of cash primarily through public and private offerings of our common stock and other securities, grants from government agencies and foundations and payments received under the terminated Takeda License Agreement. We do not believe that grant revenue will be a significant source of funding in the near future, and Takeda has limited ongoing funding obligations following the termination of the Takeda License Agreement on October 31, 2014. On March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed an additional public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\n\n\nUnregistered Sales of Securities\nWe have entered into arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element. Each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us, this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has \u201cstand-alone value\u201d to the customer. We adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis for all Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or MDRAs, entered into on or after January 1, 2011, and for any MDRAs that were entered into prior to January 1, 2011, but materially modified on or after that date.\nInterest Income\nDuring 2014 and in previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred approximately $14,000 on direct costs that were billable to Takeda as compared to $97,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor all awards granted with time-based vesting conditions, expense is amortized using the straight-line attribution method. For awards that contain a performance-based vesting condition, expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is based on share-based awards ultimately expected to vest, and this amount has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting forfeitures for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were estimated based on our historical experience and have not been material.\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a total of approximately $475.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, and approximately $6.3 million of short-term liabilities consisting entirely of liabilities from operations. Excluding the increase in net cash of approximately $121.8 million and $327.4 million from the public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, respectively, we spent approximately $103.1 million in cash for operations and equipment and we reduced working capital by approximately $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This use of cash was primarily for conducting clinical trials and non-clinical testing, including manufacturing related activities and funding recurring operating expenses.\n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 a reasonable amount of time passes between the up-front license payment and the first milestone payment, as well as between each subsequent milestone payment. \nResearch and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.8 million, or 8%. This decrease is due primarily to costs associated with outside clinical testing for our ITI-007 Phase 2 clinical trial that was completed in late 2013 as compared to costs incurred in conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical trial, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease were expenses of approximately $6.6 million incurred in 2014 as compared to $1.9 million in 2013 related to the manufacturing and other clinical and non-clinical testing of our ITI-007 product candidate and expenses of approximately $1.9 million related to our ITI-007-200 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy geriatric and dementia patients incurred only in 2014. In addition, stock option expense increased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to stock options granted in 2014.\nMarket Information\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction-specific and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018, with an option that permits companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Presently, we are assessing what effect the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\n \u2022 satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; ", "item_7_text": "Not applicable.\nPublic Accountants Practice Guide, \u201cValuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d For stock options granted in 2014 and 2015, the exercise price was determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, operating expenses, interest income (expense) and income taxes expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n \u2022 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; \n\nThe successful development of our product candidates and the approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective, will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval, or will be granted marketing approval on a timely basis, if at all. Data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval or could result in label warnings related to or recalls of approved products.\nWe expect general and administrative costs to increase significantly as we hire additional staff, expand our operations, including initial preparation for potential commercial activities, and incur additional costs associated with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in addition to being a public company and complying with exchange listing and SEC requirements, including the additional complexities and related costs of our transition at the end of 2015 from an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d to a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC. These increases could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated with investor relations activities, among others.\n\nThe top-line results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 confirm the earlier Phase 2 results that we announced in December 2013, in which ITI-007 exhibited antipsychotic efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in patients with an acutely exacerbated episode of schizophrenia. In this Phase 2 trial, 335 patients were randomized to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, orally once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In this study, ITI-007 met the trial's pre-specified primary endpoint, improving symptoms associated with schizophrenia as measured by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the PANSS total score. The trial also met key secondary outcome measures related to efficacy on PANSS subscales and safety. We are also conducting a second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second quarter of 2015, with over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the trial. In this trial, we are randomizing patients to two doses of ITI-007 (60 mg or 20 mg), risperidone (active control) or placebo over a 6-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 42 on the PANSS total score. We expect patient enrollment will be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Subject to timely enrollment, we anticipate top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available in mid-2016.\n \u2022 substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone; \nWe have adopted ASC Topic 605-28, Milestone Method. Under this guidance, we recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period the milestone is achieved. Substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met:\n \u2022 submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; \n \u2022 completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; \nOn February 5, 2014, we completed our initial public offering of 7,063,300 shares of our common stock at a price of $17.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $123.6 million. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective on January 30, 2014 (File No. 333-193313), and a registration statement on Form S-1 filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) promulgated under the Securities Act (File No. 333-193676). Leerink\n\nWe will require significant additional financing in the future to continue to fund our operations. We believe that we have the funding in place to complete the additional clinical and non-clinical trials, manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities needed for potential regulatory approval and commercialization of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia. With the remaining proceeds from our public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, we believe that we have the funds to complete our proposed clinical trials of ITI-007 in bipolar disorder as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We will also be funding clinical trials of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia; preclinical and clinical development of ITI-007 long acting injectable development program; additional clinical trials of ITI-007; continued clinical development of our PDE program, including ITI-214; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; and the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007. We anticipate requiring additional funds to obtain regulatory approval for ITI-007 in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, for further development of ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other indications, and for development of our other product candidates. We have incurred losses in every year since inception with the exception of 2011, when we received an up-front fee and a milestone payment related to the Takeda License Agreement. These losses have resulted in significant cash used in operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used net cash in operating activities and purchases of equipment of approximately $103.1 million and expect to use additional cash of between approximately $130 and $160 million through the end of 2016. While we have several research and development programs underway, the ITI-007 program has advanced the furthest and will continue to consume increasing amounts of cash for conducting clinical trials and the testing and manufacturing of product material. As we continue to conduct the activities necessary to pursue FDA approval of ITI-007 and our other product candidates, we expect the amount of cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.\nTotal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nStock-based payments in the form of options are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The fair value of share-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, or the Black-Scholes model. The resulting fair value is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the option. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\n None.\nWe seek to balance the level of cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms. Until we can generate significant revenues from operations, we will need to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private sales of our equity securities, sales of debt securities, the incurrence of debt from commercial lenders, strategic collaborations, licensing a portion or all of our product candidates and technology and, to a lesser extent, grant funding.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central nervous system, or CNS. ITI-007 is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that, we believe, may represent an effective treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, ITI-007 combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or DPPM, glutamatergic modulation, and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. At dopamine D2 receptors, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist. ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic NMDA GluN2B receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner. We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic interactions, may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved psychosocial function. The serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism, and other CNS diseases. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are incurred in three major categories:\ndepressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression), for treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, and for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, among other indications.\nCompany determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The Company's clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in it reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\n\nDetermination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management's judgment. If any of these conditions are not met, the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone, and therefore, the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportional performance or straight-line methods, as applicable. In addition, the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and, as a result, any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportional performance or straight-line methods, as applicable.\nPART II\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $4.4 million, or 73%. This increase was primarily due to increased stock option expense of $1.7 million in 2014 related to options granted in 2014, and increased labor and related benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million, with the remainder comprised of higher professional fees, directors' and officers' insurance costs, and board of directors compensation fees, which are due to the activities associated with being a public company. We expect these costs to increase significantly as we expand our operations, including hiring of additional personnel, continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of being a public company and issue additional equity incentive awards.\nAs development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia progresses, we anticipate costs for that program to increase considerably in the next several years as we continue to conduct Phase 3 and other clinical trials. We are also required to complete non-clinical testing to obtain FDA approval and manufacture material needed for clinical trial use, which includes non-clinical testing of the drug product and the creation of an inventory of drug product in anticipation of possible FDA approval. In addition we plan to spend increasing amounts to further our development of ITI-007 for other indications, including but not limited to, the treatment of\nWe are also pursuing clinical development of ITI-007 for the treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders. At the lowest doses, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to act primarily as a potent 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist. As the dose is increased, additional benefits are derived from the engagement of additional drug targets, including modest dopamine receptor modulation and modest inhibition of serotonin transporters. We believe that combined interactions at these receptors may provide additional benefits above and beyond selective 5-HT2A antagonism for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorders, while avoiding many of the side effects associated with more robust dopamine receptor antagonism. As the dose of ITI-007 is further increased, leading to moderate dopamine receptor modulation, inhibition of serotonin transporters, and indirect glutamate modulation, these actions complement the complete blockade of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. At a dose of 60 mg, ITI-007 has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we believe this higher dose range will be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases.\n Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nWe cannot be sure that future funding will be available to us when we need it on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs. The amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock or other securities depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, the status and progress of our product development programs, projected cash needs, availability of funding from other sources, our stock price and the status of the capital markets. Due to the volatile nature of the financial markets, equity and debt financing may be difficult to obtain. In addition, any unfavorable development or delay in the progress of our ITI-007 program could have a material adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital.\n\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes model for estimating fair value of our stock options granted. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require the input of subjective assumptions, and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and the expected life of the award. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.\n \u2022 the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone; and \nUnder ASC Topic 718, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized for instruments classified as equity that ordinarily would result in a future tax deduction under existing tax law shall be considered to be a deductible difference in applying ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The deductible temporary difference is based on the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. However, these provisions currently do not impact us, as all the deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance.\n\nOur pipeline also includes pre-clinical programs that are focused on advancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We are also investigating the development of treatments for disease modification of neurodegenerative disorders and non-CNS diseases.\nOther Product Candidates\n \u2022 office and facilities overhead.  We expect that research and development expenses will increase substantially as we proceed with our Phase 3 clinical trials for ITI-007 in patients with exacerbated schizophrenia and our Phase 3 clinical trials for ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder. We also expect that our general and administrative costs will increase substantially from prior periods primarily due to costs to perform pre-product commercialization activities and the increased costs associated with being a public reporting entity, which could include adding additional personnel. We granted options to purchase 884,703 shares of our common stock in 2015 and have granted options to purchase an additional 347,137 shares of our common stock in January 2016. We also granted restricted stock units for 5,272 and 78,806 shares of our common stock in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. We will recognize expense associated with these restricted stock units and options over the next three years in both research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. We expect this non-cash expense to be material and affect quarter to quarter and year to date comparisons in the upcoming year. We expect to continue to grant stock options and other stock-based awards in the future, which will increase our stock-based compensation expense in future periods.\nRevenues\n \u2022 satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites to assure that data supporting the safety and effectiveness of product candidates has been generated in compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and \nRevenues\nExpected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable publicly traded entities and other factors due to the limited historical information about our common stock. The expected life of stock options is the period of time for which the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Given the limited historical exercise data, the expected life is determined using the \u201csimplified method,\u201d which is defined as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term.\nIn September 2015, we announced top-line clinical results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 12 sites in the United States with 450 patients randomized (1:1:1) to receive either 60 mg of ITI-007, 40 mg of ITI-007 or placebo once daily in the morning for 28 days. The pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint (4 weeks) on the centrally rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. In this trial, the once-daily dose of 60 mg of ITI-007 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy with statistically significant superiority over placebo at week 4 (study endpoint) with additional improvements observed in social function. Moreover, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 showed significant antipsychotic efficacy as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the entire study. ITI-007 showed a dose-related improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with the 40 mg dose approximating the trajectory of improvement seen with the 60 mg dose, but the effect with 40 mg did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. In addition, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 met the key secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Illness, or CGI-S. The 40 mg dose of ITI-007 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the CGI-S, though not formally tested against placebo as a key\nThe process of researching and developing drugs for human use is lengthy, unpredictable and subject to many risks. We are unable with any certainty to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those costs will be incurred. The clinical development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression consumes and will continue to consume a large portion of our current, as well as projected, resources. We intend to pursue other disease indications that ITI-007 may address, but there are significant costs associated with pursuing FDA approval for those indications, which would include the cost of additional clinical trials.\n\nOur ITI-002 program has a compound, ITI-214, in Phase 1 development. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson's disease, cognition in Alzheimer's disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Our other projects are still in the pre-clinical stages, and will require extensive funding not only to complete pre-clinical testing, but to enter into and complete clinical trials. Expenditures that we incur on these projects will be subject to availability of funding in addition to the funding required for the advancement of ITI-007. Any failure or delay in the advancement of ITI-007 could require us to re-allocate resources from our other projects to the advancement of ITI-007, which could have a significant material adverse impact on the advancement of these other projects and on our results of operations. Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. Our research and development costs are comprised of:\n The following table sets forth consolidated financial data with respect to the Company for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2015. The selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2015 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and the report thereon, are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements (and notes thereon) and \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d included in Item 7.\nDividends\n The table of Contractual Obligations and Commitments does not reflect that, under the License Agreement with BMS, we may be obligated to make future milestone payments to BMS totaling $12 million; to make other future milestone payments to BMS for each licensed product of up to an aggregate of approximately $14.75 million; to make tiered single digit percentage royalty payments on sales of licensed products; and to pay BMS a percentage of non-royalty payments made in consideration of any sublicense.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update as of the fourth quarter of 2015, retrospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\n We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\nSince we had net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no excess tax benefits for the tax deductions related to share-based awards were recognized in the statements of operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nRevenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $2.2 million, or 79%, due primarily to the recognition in 2013 of previously deferred revenue relating to the Takeda License Agreement and lower reimbursable costs payable to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement, offset to a much lesser extent by revenue from a government grant in 2014.\n \u2022 fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and related testing, clinical trial activities and license milestone payments. \nWe have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery and development of our product candidates. We complement our management team with a group of scientific and clinical advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of schizophrenia and other CNS disorders, including Nobel laureate, Dr. Paul Greengard, one of our co-founders.\nOverview\nExcept for payments made in advance of services, the Company expenses its research and development costs as incurred. For payments made in advance, the Company recognizes research and development expense as the services are rendered. Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel and resources and the costs of clinical trials. Other research and development expenses include preclinical analytical testing, outside services, providers, materials and consulting fees.\nPartners LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. Guggenheim Securities, LLC and JMP Securities LLC acted as co-managers for the offering. The offering commenced on January 24, 2014 and did not terminate until the sale of all of the shares offered.\n\nThe primary endpoint for both clinical trials is change from baseline at Day 42 on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, orMADRS, total score versus placebo. The MADRS is a well-validated 10-item checklist that measures the ability of a drug to reduce overall severity of depressive symptoms. Individual items\nExpenses\nUse of Proceeds from Registered Securities\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.8 million, or 76%, primarily due to approximately $4.1 million of higher stock option expense and to a much lesser extent to increased bonus and labor costs and state and local franchise and capital taxes. Salaries, bonuses and related benefit costs for our executive, finance and administrative functions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 59% and 49%, respectively, of our total general and administrative costs. Our other general and administrative expenses include patent costs, legal, accounting and other professional fees and, to a lesser extent, facilities and general office-related overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been from a government grant and the residual reimbursement of expenses from the terminated Takeda License Agreement. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been from the terminated Takeda License Agreement and to a much lesser extent from a government grant. We will not receive any further revenue under the Takeda License Agreement, which was terminated on October 31, 2014. We have received and may continue to receive grants from U.S. government agencies and foundations.\nWe received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $115.4 million, after deducting approximately $7.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions, and approximately $0.8 million of offering expenses payable by us. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were incurred or paid to our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates.\nThe risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. We have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend rate of zero.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses. We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate additional late phase clinical programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, in the first half of 2016.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\n Not applicable.\nGiven the potential utility for ITI-007 and follow-on compounds to treat these additional indications, we may investigate, either on our own or with a partner, agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in additional diseases that include autism spectrum disorders; depressive disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; non-motor symptoms and motor complications associated with Parkinson's disease; and post-traumatic stress disorder. We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to ITI-007 and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company pursuant to an exclusive license.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to our research and development activities. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $193.0 million. We expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates and programs. Our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nIf adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: (1) delay, limit, reduce or terminate pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates, including our lead product candidate ITI-007, ITI-214, and our other pre-clinical stage product candidates; (2) delay, limit, reduce or terminate our discovery research or pre-clinical development activities; or (3) enter into licenses or other arrangements with third parties on terms that may be unfavorable to us or sell, license or relinquish rights to develop or commercialize our product candidates, technologies or intellectual property at an earlier stage of development and on less favorable terms than we would otherwise agree.\n \u2022 submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all clinical trials; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we have used the net proceeds of the offering primarily for working capital purposes, including recurring expenses and preclinical and clinical trial costs related to the development of ITI-007.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from those estimates and under different assumptions or conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed 24 full time personnel in our research and development group as compared to 16 full time personnel at December 31, 2014. We expect to hire additional staff as we increase our development efforts and grow our business in the upcoming years.\nNot applicable.\nResults of Operations\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nare rated by an expert clinician on a scale of 0 to 6 in which a score of 6 represents the most depressed evaluation for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. Secondary endpoints include measures of social function and quality of life that may illustrate the differentiated clinical profile of ITI-007. Safety and tolerability are also assessed in both clinical trials.\nInterest income has increased to approximately $1.0 million from $304,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is primarily a result of higher than average cash balances in 2015 as compared to 2014 which is due to the net offering proceeds of $121.8 million that we received in March 2015 and $327.4 million that we received in September 2015.\nDuring previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $30,700 and $14,000, respectively, of costs that were billable to Takeda pursuant to ongoing obligations under the termination agreement. We do not expect to incur material costs going forward under this agreement.\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations and our wholly-owned subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn 2014, we entered into a long-term lease, which was amended in December 2015, for 16,753 square feet of useable laboratory and office space located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York 10016. Due to the amortization of total lease payments, we have recognized $1.6 million of deferred rent in the year ended December 31, 2015. The deferred rent balance will incrementally increase over approximately the next year. We occupied these facilities as our headquarters in March 2015, replacing our previous laboratories and offices. The lease, as amended, has a term of 12 years. We expect that our facility related costs will increase moderately as a result of leasing this facility.\n \u2022 achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; \nOther Indications for ITI-007\nOur bipolar depression program consists of two Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: one to evaluate ITI-007 as a monotherapy and the other to evaluate ITI-007 as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In each trial, approximately 550 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing a current major depressive episode will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 40 mg ITI-007, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio orally once daily for 6 weeks. In the ITI-007-401 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo as a monotherapy. In the ITI-007-402 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo adjunctive to their existing mood stabilizer lithium or valproate. We initiated our bipolar depression program in the third quarter of 2015.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nthe first compound in its class to successfully advance into Phase 1 clinical trials. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson's disease, cognition in Alzheimer's disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Other compounds in the PDE portfolio are also being advanced for the treatment of various indications.\nThe research and development expenses incurred for amounts payable to external parties comprised a significant portion of our research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We incurred expenses of approximately $14.8 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for amounts payable to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial activities for all of our projects. We spent approximately $14.4 million and $18.3 million on external costs for the development of ITI-007 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the same periods, our internal research and development expenses for all projects were approximately $5.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The clinical development work related to ITI-007 requires the largest portion of our resources and, consequently, comprises the majority of our spending. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred total expenses of $18.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively, for all ITI-007 related projects and $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for all of our other projects. Total research and development expenses were approximately $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $23.0 million for 2013.\n\nRevenues\nThe research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. This process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:\n \nYou should read this report and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed as exhibits to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report, and we do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 the milestone payments are non-refundable; \nsecondary endpoint since it did not separate on the primary endpoint. Consistent with previous studies, ITI-007 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as evidenced by motoric, metabolic, and cardiovascular characteristics similar to placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nItem 7 as well as other sections in this report, discuss some of the factors that could contribute to these differences. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about:\n \u2022 salaries and related benefit costs; \n Stockholders\n\nWe have a second major program called ITI-002 that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. We believe PDE1 helps regulate brain activity related to cognition, memory processes and movement/coordination. On February 25, 2011, we (through our wholly owned operating subsidiary, ITI) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Takeda License Agreement, under which we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize our proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 for use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. On October 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Takeda terminating the Takeda License Agreement, or the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which all rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to us. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for ITI-214 to us. ITI-214 is\n Our headquarters are located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York 10016, where we occupy approximately 16,753 square feet of useable office and laboratory space. The term of the lease, as amended, expires January 31, 2027. We also lease office space in Towson, Maryland on a month to month basis.\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, we also announced top-line data from an open-label positron emission tomography, or PET, study of ITI-007 examining brain occupancy of striatal D2 receptors. This study was conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were otherwise healthy and stable with respect to their psychosis. After washout from their previous antipsychotic medication for at least two weeks, PET was used to determine target occupancy in brain regions at baseline (drug-free) and again after two weeks of once daily ITI-007 oral administration. In this trial, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 was associated with a mean of approximately 40% striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. As predicted by preclinical and earlier clinical data, ITI-007 demonstrated antipsychotic effect at relatively low striatal D2 receptor occupancy, lower than the occupancy range required by most other antipsychotic drugs. Unlike any existing schizophrenia treatment, this dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator, or DPPM, acts as a pre-synaptic partial agonist and post-synaptic antagonist at D2 receptors. We believe this mechanism likely contributes to the favorable safety profile of ITI-007, with reduced risk for hyperprolactinemia, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and other motoric side effects.\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company's objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $485.9 thousand, or 84%, primarily due to reimbursable costs paid to us by Takeda in 2014 under the Takeda License Agreement which terminated on October 31, 2014 with limited reimbursements in 2015, offset by slightly higher revenue in 2015 from a government grant.\n \u2022 internal recurring costs, such as labor and fringe benefits, materials and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs; and \nWe do not expect any revenues that we may generate in the next several years to be significant enough to fund our operations.\nFrom December 20, 2013 through January 30, 2014, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Markets-OTCQB tier, or OTCQB, under the symbol \u201cITCI.\u201d On January 31, 2014, our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cITCI\u201d and ceased being quoted on the OTCQB. The high and low bid quotations per share of our common stock as reported by the OTCQB and the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by NASDAQ for the applicable periods when the common stock was quoted on the OTCBB or listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, as applicable, since the common stock commenced public trading are set forth below:\nOur cash is maintained in checking accounts, money market accounts, money market mutual funds, U.S. government agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes and corporate bonds at major financial institutions. Due to the current low interest rates available for these instruments, we are earning limited interest income. We do not expect interest income to be a significant source of funding over the next several quarters. Our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the problems in the credit markets that have existed over the last several years, but there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future.\nWe currently have several projects, in addition to ITI-007, that are in the research and development stages, including in the areas of cognitive dysfunction and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, among others. We have used internal resources and incurred expenses not only in relation to the development of ITI-007, but also in connection with these additional projects as well. We have not, however, reported these costs on a project by project basis, as these costs are broadly spread among these projects. The external costs for these projects have been minimal and are reflected in the amounts discussed in this section \u201c-Research and Development Expenses.\u201d\nOn March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million, and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed a public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $43.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Schizophrenia\n \u2022 FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. \nPublic Offerings in March 2015 and September 2015\nITI-007 for the Treatment of Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Depression)\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nResearch and development expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $66.5 million, or 313%. This change is due primarily to an increase of approximately $47.1 million of costs associated with outside clinical testing and an increase of approximately $14.9 million from nonclinical testing in the year ended December 31, 2015 over the year ended December 31, 2014. The vast majority of the increase is due to costs associated with conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical program in schizophrenia. In late 2014, we began a clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia and incurred the majority of the costs for this trial in 2015. In addition, we started our second Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia in June 2015 and incurred significant costs for this trial in the second half of 2015. In December 2015, we commenced our Phase 3 clinical trials in bipolar disorder and have incurred approximately $3.6 million in costs through December 31, 2015. In 2014, we did not incur significant costs related to clinical trials. Amounts paid to external parties comprise a large portion of our research and development costs. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred approximately $76.8 million of costs to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial related activities as compared to $16.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Of these external costs, approximately $76.1 million in the year ended December 30, 2015 and $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were for ITI-007 related projects. The remaining amounts for each of these periods were spent on other projects. Internal costs are comprised primarily of labor, fringe benefits, materials, supplies and facilities and maintenance costs and were approximately $10.9 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in these internal costs is due primarily to hiring additional research and development employees in 2015 in addition to increased stock based compensation expense.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur corporate headquarters and laboratory are located in New York, New York.\nIn addition to our two Phase 3 clinical trials, we will need to complete other clinical and non-clinical trials and manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities necessary to support the submission of a planned NDA for ITI-007 in schizophrenia, which we currently expect could occur in the first half of 2017.\nWith the termination of the Takeda License Agreement in October 2014, we will not receive milestone payments and only limited expense reimbursements, including patent filing costs, from Takeda and will be responsible for the costs of developing ITI-214. On September 15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the IND for ITI-214 to us. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE1 program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, but we do not anticipate a significant increase in our operating expenses related to our PDE development programs through at least the first half of 2016.\nAs of February 25, 2016, we had 43,202,709 outstanding shares of common stock and no outstanding shares of preferred stock. As of February 25, 2016, there were approximately 125 holders of record of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nPrior to January 1, 2014, given that there was no active market for our common stock, the exercise price of the stock options on the date of grant was determined and approved by the board of directors using several factors, including progress and milestones achieved in our business development and performance, the price per share of our convertible preferred stock offerings and general industry and economic trends. In establishing the estimated fair value of our common stock, we considered the guidance set forth in American Institute of Certified\nFor the year 2016, we expect to spend between approximately $130 million and $160 million. We expect these expenditures to be due primarily to the development of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances in dementia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorders, our ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development, research and preclinical development of our other product candidates, the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007, recurring expenses and costs to produce, develop and validate materials to be used in clinical and non-clinical studies related to ITI-007, and expenses associated with our other development programs and general operations. We expect that cash expenditures will continue to increase after 2016 as we further expand the ITI-007 clinical stage programs, the ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development; research and preclinical development of our other product candidates; the continuation of manufacturing, pre-commercial activities in connection with the development of ITI-007 and the early stage pre-commercial launch activities for ITI-007. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of 2018.\n \u2022 patent, legal and professional costs; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our product candidates. Other risks associated with our product candidates are described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity instruments issued to non-employees are accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 718 and ASC Topic 505-50, Equity/Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed and are marked to market during the service period.\nRevenue is recognized when all terms and conditions of the agreements have been met, including that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We are reimbursed for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants, collaboration agreements, and awards. We record the amount of reimbursement as revenues on a gross basis in accordance with ASC Topic 605-45, Revenue Recognition/Principal Agent Considerations. We are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, are obligated to compensate the service provider for the work performed, and have discretion in selecting the supplier. Provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period such losses are determined.\n\nwe make. We have included important cautionary statements in this report, particularly in the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make.\n We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements\nResearch and Development\nThe adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, or on our financial positions as of those dates.\nRevenue Recognition\n\n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nThrough December 31, 2015, we provided funds for our operations by obtaining approximately $716.3 million of cash primarily through public and private offerings of our common stock and other securities, grants from government agencies and foundations and payments received under the terminated Takeda License Agreement. We do not believe that grant revenue will be a significant source of funding in the near future, and Takeda has limited ongoing funding obligations following the termination of the Takeda License Agreement on October 31, 2014. On March 11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $121.8 million. On September 28, 2015, we completed an additional public offering of 7,935,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $345.2 million and net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million.\n\n\nUnregistered Sales of Securities\nWe have entered into arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element. Each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us, this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has \u201cstand-alone value\u201d to the customer. We adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis for all Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or MDRAs, entered into on or after January 1, 2011, and for any MDRAs that were entered into prior to January 1, 2011, but materially modified on or after that date.\nInterest Income\nDuring 2014 and in previous years, we also incurred costs that were both reimbursable and non-reimbursable under the Takeda License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred approximately $14,000 on direct costs that were billable to Takeda as compared to $97,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor all awards granted with time-based vesting conditions, expense is amortized using the straight-line attribution method. For awards that contain a performance-based vesting condition, expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is based on share-based awards ultimately expected to vest, and this amount has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting forfeitures for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were estimated based on our historical experience and have not been material.\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a total of approximately $475.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, and approximately $6.3 million of short-term liabilities consisting entirely of liabilities from operations. Excluding the increase in net cash of approximately $121.8 million and $327.4 million from the public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, respectively, we spent approximately $103.1 million in cash for operations and equipment and we reduced working capital by approximately $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This use of cash was primarily for conducting clinical trials and non-clinical testing, including manufacturing related activities and funding recurring operating expenses.\n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 a reasonable amount of time passes between the up-front license payment and the first milestone payment, as well as between each subsequent milestone payment. \nResearch and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.8 million, or 8%. This decrease is due primarily to costs associated with outside clinical testing for our ITI-007 Phase 2 clinical trial that was completed in late 2013 as compared to costs incurred in conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical trial, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease were expenses of approximately $6.6 million incurred in 2014 as compared to $1.9 million in 2013 related to the manufacturing and other clinical and non-clinical testing of our ITI-007 product candidate and expenses of approximately $1.9 million related to our ITI-007-200 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy geriatric and dementia patients incurred only in 2014. In addition, stock option expense increased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to stock options granted in 2014.\nMarket Information\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction-specific and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the standard from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018, with an option that permits companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Presently, we are assessing what effect the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\n \u2022 satisfactory completion of an FDA
