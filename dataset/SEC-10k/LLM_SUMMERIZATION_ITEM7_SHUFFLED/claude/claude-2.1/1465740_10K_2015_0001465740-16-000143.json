Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a REIT, as defined under the Code.\nWe are externally managed by PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River, a global multi-strategy asset management firm providing comprehensive portfolio management, transparency and liquidity to institutional and high net worth investors.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Residential mortgage loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MSR;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial real estate assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We generally view our target assets in three strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets with inherent credit risk including non-Agency RMBS, net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans. Our commercial strategy, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, includes as target assets first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, b-notes and preferred equity. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans.\nAs opportunities in the residential and commercial mortgage marketplace change, we continue to evolve our business model. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to continue to increase our allocation towards MSR, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets, and decrease our exposure to RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold a number of Agency RMBS, primarily due to widening spreads and our belief that it is prudent to position ourselves with minimal basis and prepayment risk exposure. Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nWithin our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business, we acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions with the intent to securitize the loans through the issuance of non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. Our intention is to retain the related subordinated securities, representing the credit risk piece associated with these deals. We also hold a small legacy portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default on CSL than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans or provide direct financing to lenders; rather, through our mortgage loan conduit we contract with originators to acquire loans they originate that meet our purchase criteria.\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. Additionally, as an owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. We held a small portfolio of these Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2015, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD. We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, nor the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions.\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation decisions factor in the opportunities in the marketplace, cost of financing and cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation among the target assets in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding period ends:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rates strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loan conduit/securitization\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial strategy\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing shift. As previously discussed, our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2015, our net yield realized on the portfolio was higher than previous periods. Yields and net interest spreads on Agency RMBS and MSR are generally higher than recent quarters, while yields and spreads on non-Agency RMBS has generally decreased. Net yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations have been relatively consistent. Additionally, our cost of financing has decreased as a result of lower swap spread. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our target assets, including Agency and non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment, net of collateralized borrowings, in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annualized portfolio yield (1)\n</td> <td>4.56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.46%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of financing (2)\n</td> <td>1.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.33%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.55%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net portfolio yield\n</td> <td>3.26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.07%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.91%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Average annualized yield incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Cost of financing includes swap interest rate spread.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our RMBS assets through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and through short- and long-term advances from the FHLB. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency RMBS, with less liquidity and exposure to credit risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. We may also finance our U.S. Treasuries, which we hold from time to time for trading purposes, and our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets is the most meaningful leverage measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the sustainability and price of our financing, diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 3.0 to 5.0 times to finance our RMBS portfolio, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the make-up of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from common stock offerings we conduct. See the section titled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and that we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. In addition, we have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from our external manager's analytical and portfolio management expertise and infrastructure. We believe that our significant focus on the mortgage market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans and to own and manage MSR.\nOn December 19, 2012, we completed the contribution of our portfolio of single-family rental properties to Silver Bay, a newly organized Maryland corporation intended to qualify as a REIT and focused on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family residential properties for rental income and long-term capital appreciation. We contributed our equity interests in the wholly owned subsidiary, Two Harbors Property Investment LLC to Silver Bay, and in exchange for the contribution, received shares of common stock of Silver Bay. Silver Bay completed its IPO of its common stock on December 19, 2012. We distributed shares of Silver Bay common stock we received in the transaction to our stockholders on or about April 24, 2013. Because we will not have any significant continuing involvement in Two Harbors Property Investment LLC, all of the associated operating results were removed from continuing operations and are presented separately as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. No remaining associated operating results were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOverview\nOur 2015 efforts focused on three strategic objectives that we believe will position us for long-term success.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Managing a portfolio of RMBS to generate attractive returns with balanced risks. We operate a hybrid REIT model, diversifying our portfolio across Agency and non-Agency RMBS in combination with derivative hedging instruments. We manage to an overall low level of interest rate exposure and leverage. We believe effectively managing an appropriate balance of risks within our portfolio is critical to providing an attractive return to our stockholders and our ability to adjust our allocations and deploy capital across sectors allow us to optimize portfolio results over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Executing business diversification opportunities across residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets. We continue to pursue a variety of opportunities that leverage our core competencies of credit and prepayment risk management. We acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions and have established a nonconforming loan securitization program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we meaningfully increased the number of sellers in our network and completed seven securitizations. Within our MSR business, we continue to purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. During 2015, we expanded our flow-sale arrangements within our originator partner network. In addition, we originate and acquire senior and mezzanine commercial real estate assets. These assets are U.S. domiciled and are secured by a diverse mix of property types including office, retail, multifamily and hotel properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans. We are taking a measured approach as we diversify, keeping true to our strategic long-term plans and our core strengths.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining best in class\u201d investment, corporate governance, investor relations and disclosure practices. We attribute our growth to portfolio alpha generation, innovation and best practice in corporate governance and disclosure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nOur net interest income includes income from our RMBS portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and income from our residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs, and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency RMBS and in our mortgage loan and commercial real estate portfolios.\nFair Value Measurement\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are at fair value and, therefore, our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2015, approximately 86.3% of total assets, or $12.6 billion, and approximately 18.3% of total liabilities, or $2.0 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 16 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices. Although markets for asset-backed securities, including RMBS, have modestly stabilized since the severe dislocations experienced as a result of the financial crisis, these markets continue to experience volatility and, as a result, our assets and liabilities will continue to be subject to valuation adjustment as well as changes in the inputs we use to measure fair value.\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrealized fair value gains on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, positively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on certain U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments due to their short-term investment objectives, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, net economic interests in securitizations and MSR.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements negatively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments and MSR, however, negatively affected our financial results.\nIn addition, our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were affected by the unrealized gains and losses of certain other derivative instruments that were accounted for as trading derivative instruments (i.e., credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps, inverse interest-only securities and forward residential mortgage loan purchase commitments).\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing providers. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other RMBS instruments, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency RMBS. We also typically receive two vendor quotes for the residential mortgage loans and MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (i.e., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For residential mortgage loans and MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, address, LTV ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields, securitization economics and trading levels. Additionally for MSR, pricing providers will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both brokers and independent pricing providers by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge broker quotes and valuations from third-party pricing providers to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of residential mortgage loans and MSR based upon the average of prices received from independent providers, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our RMBS assets and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, trading securities, mortgage loans, MSR and collateralized borrowings may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities\nOur RMBS investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFrom time to time, we also hold U.S. Treasuries for trading purposes. Our trading securities are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If our RMBS AFS were also classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our GAAP net income (loss).\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income, while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. Fair value is generally determined based on current secondary market pricing or cash flow models using market-based yield requirements.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. An entity is allowed to measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying collateralized financing entity, or CFE, it consolidates using the fair value of either the CFE's financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. As the Company's securitization trusts are considered qualifying CFEs, the Company determines the fair value of these residential mortgage loans based on the fair value of its collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and its retained interests from the Company's on-balance sheet securitizations (eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP), as the fair value of these instruments is more observable.\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income, rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the valuation includes unobservable market data inputs (prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and discount rates).\nClassification and Valuation of Collateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts\nOur collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net (loss) income. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data.\nImpairment of Commercial Real Estate Loans Held-for-Investment\nCommercial real estate loans held-for-investment are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. Because our commercial real estate loans are collateralized either by real property or by equity interests in the commercial real estate borrower, impairment is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral to the amortized cost of the respective loan. The valuation of the underlying collateral requires significant judgment, which includes assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, credit worthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, overall economic conditions, the broader commercial real estate market, local geographic sub-markets, and other factors deemed necessary. If a loan is determined to be impaired, we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan through a charge to provision for loan losses. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from these estimates.\nInterest Income Recognition\nOur interest income on our Agency and non-Agency RMBS is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency RMBS rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nFor non-Agency RMBS purchased at a discount, we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nInterest income on residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Additionally, any acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the effective interest method. All residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans are considered past due when they are 30 days past their contractual due date. Interest income recognition is suspended when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for more than 60 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed and subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Loans are restored to accrual status only when contractually current or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We rely on internal models corroborated by quotations from a third party to determine these fair values. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\nThe key macroeconomic factors that impact our business are home prices and the employment and interest rate environments. Home prices increased modestly throughout 2015, and are expected to gradually appreciate over the next several years. Credit standards remain tight, despite a modest easing in recent months, and have limited borrowers' ability to refinance their mortgages notwithstanding low interest rates and government programs that promote refinancing. Employment market conditions remain relatively solid as jobless claims, unemployment and payroll data are showing stable trends, although underemployment levels remain stubbornly high and new job creation has been disappointing. Other than LTV ratios and cash reserves, we believe employment is the most powerful determinant of homeowners' ongoing likelihood to pay their mortgages. Home price performance and employment are particularly important to our non-Agency portfolio.\nThe interest rate environment remained volatile in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the Federal Reserve announced a rate hike in December for the first time in eight years. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term, however, as the Federal Reserve has suggested it will take a measured and conservative approach to further interest rate decisions. Additionally, it appears the Federal Reserve will continue to reinvest its mortgage-backed security principal repayments for the foreseeable future.\nThe U.S. economy continues to navigate headwinds that include global economic lethargy, specifically in China; geopolitical unrest across various regions worldwide; the ongoing European debt crisis; quantitative easing by the European Central Bank; and persistently high underemployment.\nRegulatory and legislative actions taken in the past few years in an effort to improve economic conditions and increase liquidity in the financial markets, as well as other actions related to the fall-out from the financial and foreclosure crises, continue to impact the market. Regulatory actions that could affect the value and availability of our target assets, either positively or negatively, include: attempts by the U.S. government to further simplify the refinancing process to allow more borrowers to refinance into lower interest rate mortgage loans; the streamlined loan modification initiative for borrowers that are 90+ days delinquent implemented by the GSEs; the real estate owned, or REO, -to-rental program supported by the GSEs; the extension of both the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program 2.0, or HARP 2.0, through 2016; the strict ability-to-repay\u201d and qualified mortgage\u201d regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB; the enforcement of and potential liability associated with TRID; and the application of the risk retention requirements of Section 15G of the Exchange Act.\nThere have also been a number of legislative proposals aimed at eventually winding down or phasing out the GSEs. It continues to remain uncertain if any proposal will ultimately become legislation, as recently these efforts appear to have little momentum in Congress. We will continue to monitor these and other regulatory and policy activities closely.\nIn 2014, the U.S. Department of Treasury, or the Treasury, requested comment on the development of a responsible private label securities market. We believe that private capital, through the private label securities market, is a critical component to the long-term stability of the mortgage market and, accordingly, submitted a comment letter in response to the request. The Treasury echoes our sentiment and views a diverse housing finance system with numerous capital streams as critical to promoting competition, market efficiency, and consumer choice.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency RMBS portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility. As such, we have diversified into several target assets that capitalize on our prepayment and credit expertise.\nWe expect that a material percentage of our assets will remain in whole-pool Agency RMBS in light of the long-term attractiveness of the asset class and in order to continue to satisfy the requirements of our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Interest-only Agency securities and MSR also provide a complementary investment and risk-management strategy to our principal and interest Agency RMBS investments. Risk-adjusted returns in our Agency RMBS portfolio may decline if we are required to pay higher purchase premiums due to lower interest rates or additional liquidity in the market. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's prior quantitative easing programs and continued reinvestment of its mortgage-backed security principal repayments and other policy changes may impact the returns of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our RMBS portfolio by product type:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,864,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,164,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrid ARMs\n</td> <td>108,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Agency\n</td> <td>5,972,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,292,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency Derivatives\n</td> <td>157,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior\n</td> <td>1,313,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,370,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mezzanine\n</td> <td>532,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-only securities\n</td> <td>6,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-Agency\n</td> <td>1,852,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,048,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,983,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,527,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nOur Agency RMBS and MSR portfolios are subject to inherent prepayment risk. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR to deteriorate, and our fixed coupon Agency pools to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. As previously discussed, despite the Federal Reserve raising rates in December, the low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our security selection process, positions us to ideally respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nThe following table provides the three-month weighted average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our Agency RMBS throughout 2015:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average CPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2016 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\nOur portfolio includes Agency securities, which includes securities with explicit prepayment protection, $85,000 maximum loan balance pools (securities collateralized by loans of less than $85,000 in principal), other low loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $175,000, but more than $85,000 in principal), high LTV ratios (securities collateralized by loans with greater or equal to 80% LTV predominantly comprised of Making Homeownership Affordable, or MHA, pools that consist of borrowers who have refinanced through HARP), home equity conversion mortgages (securities collateralized by reverse mortgages), low FICO scores (lower credit borrowers), and seasoned securities reflecting less prepayment risk due to previously experienced high levels of refinancing. We believe these RMBS characteristics reduce the prepayment risk to the portfolio.\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by vintage and prepayment protection:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency RMBS AFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Agency RMBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hybrid ARMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other low loan balances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,101,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,101,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$85K Max Pools\n</td> <td>1,439,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 and subsequent vintages\n</td> <td>685,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High LTV (predominantly MHA)\n</td> <td>421,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity conversion mortgages\n</td> <td>386,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seasoned (2005 and prior vintages)\n</td> <td>184,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 and subsequent vintages -

We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency RMBS provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency RMBS on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\nWe evaluate credit risk on our residential mortgage loans through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis and through on-going asset surveillance.\nWe also evaluate credit risk on our commercial real estate assets through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes valuing the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, borrowing entity or loan sponsor. We also assess the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties, and the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. We evaluate each commercial real estate asset for impairment at least quarterly and may record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, if deemed impaired.\nCounterparty exposure and leverage ratio\nWe monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to a single counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties, 21 of which had outstanding balances at December 31, 2015, including one facility that provides short-term financing for our residential mortgage loan collateral with outstanding balances at December 31, 2015. In addition, we held long-term secured advances from the FHLB. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio of 3.0 times. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only was 2.5:1.0. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $737.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $40.9 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $48.9 million of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from the Company's on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately $71.7 million. We also had approximately $18.9 million of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, $11.0 million of unpledged CSL, $36.1 million of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $43.9 million of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans and $255.9 million of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately $170.7 million. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage.\nWe also monitor exposure to counterparties involved in our mortgage loan conduit and MSR businesses. In connection with securitization transactions and MSR assets, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the investors in the RMBS we issue or the loans underlying the MSR we own. If the representations and warranties that we are required to make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of these businesses. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur reported GAAP net income was $210.7 million ($0.59 per diluted weighted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and our reported GAAP net income was $492.2 million ($1.35 per diluted weighted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to GAAP net loss of $37.0 million ($(0.10) per weighted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and GAAP net income of $167.1 million ($0.46 per weighted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income (loss) to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted as trading instruments. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive (loss) income were $213.9 million and for the three months ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $79.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $42.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities were $496.7 million and for the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $411.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $578.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn December 16, 2015, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, bringing our total 2015 cash dividends declared to $1.04 per diluted share. Our book value per diluted common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $10.11 at December 31, 2015, a decrease from $11.10 book value per diluted common share at December 31, 2014. During this twelve month period, we recognized a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $496.7 million and declared cash dividends of $378.3 million, driving the overall decrease in book value.\nThe following tables present the components of our comprehensive (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2013:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

months ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to sales of AFS securities in 2015, offset by purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015. Conversely, total interest income increased from $606.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $628.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015, offset by sales of AFS securities in 2015.\nYields on AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net yields on AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was predominantly driven by the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value. The increase in net yields on Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment. The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. We did not recognize any interest income on trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading security position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\nYields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment were relatively consistent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as rates on prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans were generally flat over the course of the past two years. The yields on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represent interest income on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, are not indicative of future yields.\nThe following tables present the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes Agency Derivatives.

The net interest spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with that for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net interest spread on non-Agency RMBS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014,was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, combined with increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties.\nThe increase in net interest rate spread on Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties. The decrease in net interest spread on our trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was generally the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014. We did not recognize any interest income or expense on trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading security position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\nThe increase in net interest rate spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The increase in net interest spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily the result of an increase in the outstanding balance of FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations.\nThe net interest rate spread on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represents interest income, net of interest expense, on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, is not indicative of future spreads.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, we did not recognize any OTTI losses, but for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $0.5 million in OTTI losses. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.2 million and $0.4 million in OTTI losses, respectively. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we sold AFS securities for $3.3 billion and $7.0 billion with an amortized cost of $3.2 billion and $6.6 billion, for net realized gains of $109.5 million and $369.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $2.0 billion with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion, resulting in net realized gains of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not hold or sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2015. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we sold AFS securities for $303.1 million and $3.5 billion with an amortized cost of $278.6 million and $3.4 billion, for net realized gains of $24.5 million and $84.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.1 billion with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion, for a net realized gain of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We did not sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2014. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that our management believes have higher risk-adjusted returns.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $9.7 million and $12.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, trading securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $1.4 million, compared to a change in unrealized gains of $4.2 million and losses of $2.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively. We did not hold any trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in change in unrealized losses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was driven by the sale of our U.S. Treasuries and corresponding recognition of realized gains during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $12.6 million and $85.6 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $14.1 billion and $16.1 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $32.2 million and $91.8 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $22.0 billion and $23.3 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 28 and 97 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $12.7 billion and $60.1 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $8.7 million and $41.0 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $101.1 million and $226.2 million in realized losses on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, including early termination penalties. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 21 and 68 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $11.0 billion and $37.4 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $14.1 million and $19.6 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $3.7 million and $55.4 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\nAlso included in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation gains of $156.2 million and $101.2 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized changes in unrealized valuation losses of $116.7 million and gains of $198.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(85,636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91,754\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early termination, agreement maturation and option expiration losses\n</td> <td>(101,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, at fair value\n</td> <td>156,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(198,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on interest rate swap and swaption agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(152,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(210,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(345,647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nIncluded in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $2.1 million and $5.0 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $6.6 million and $27.8 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $142.2 million and $149.6 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $5.2 million and $17.5 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was the recognition of $7.6 million and $30.2 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $177.8 million and $188.8 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and loan portfolios.\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded losses of $4.0 million and gains of $14.3 million on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of losses of $3.7 million and gains of $16.0 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and losses of $0.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $11.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of $8.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and gains of $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gains (losses) recorded on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nServicing Income\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total servicing income of $32.8 million and $127.4 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $31.9 million and $123.8 million, ancillary fee income of $0.5 million and $2.1 million, and float income of $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $31.6 million and $128.2 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $30.7 million and $125.1 million, and ancillary fee income of $0.6 million and $2.2 million, and float income of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with that for the same periods in 2014 due to similar average MSR portfolio sizes during the respective periods.\n(Loss) Gain on Servicing Asset\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, loss on servicing asset of $3.3 million and $99.6 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $15.2 million and $48.0 million and an increase of $11.9 million and decrease of $51.6 million, respectively, in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $55.3 million and $128.4 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $13.7 million and $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $41.6 million and $73.6 million, respectively. The decrease in loss on servicing asset for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was the result of decreasing prepayment speeds and delinquencies.\nOther (Loss) Income\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded other loss of $5.5 million and $21.8 million, which includes $19.4 million and $52.4 million in losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $12.3 million and $25.9 million in gains on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts, respectively. Also included in other (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.1 million and $0.5 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other loss of $1.4 million and other income of $18.5 million, which includes $9.4 million and $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $11.5 million and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other (loss) income for the both three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.2 million and $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The increase in other loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nManagement Fees\nWe incurred management fees of $12.3 million and $50.3 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and $12.2 million and $48.8 million for the same periods in 2014, which are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. See further discussion of the management fee calculation in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSecuritization Deal Costs\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts, compared to $1.3 million and $4.6 million for the same periods in 2014. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\nServicing Expenses\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $8.3 million and $28.1 million, respectively, in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSR, compared to $1.3 million and $25.9 million for the same periods in 2014. Included in servicing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to a decrease in the MSR representation and warranty reserve of $5.1 million and MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $1.8 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by the reduction in the MSR representation and warranty reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther Operating Expenses\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $16.1 million and $64.2 million, respectively, of other operating expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of 1.7% and 1.6% of average equity, compared to $14.9 million and $56.2 million of expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of 1.5% and 1.4% of average equity, for the same periods in 2014. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the personnel and infrastructure to support our residential mortgage loan, MSR and commercial real estate activities, as well as a decrease in our average equity balance due to share repurchases and a comprehensive loss recognized for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to comprehensive income for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $6.8 million and $22.9 million, compared to $4.0 million and $15.5 million of costs for the same periods in 2014. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel of $0.2 million and $1.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and $0.2 million and $1.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel, of $0.8 million and $4.4 million, compared to $1.6 million and $6.6 million for the same periods in 2014.\nWe have an established accounts payable function and direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $8.8 million and a benefit from income taxes of $16.5 million, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $11.7 million and $73.7 million for the same periods in 2014. The provision recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities held in our TRSs. Conversely, the benefit recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs.

The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The decrease in yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the sale of substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. The change in yields on mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of changes in interest rates on mortgage loans securitized throughout 2014.\nThe following table presents the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross yield/stated coupon\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net yield (2)\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes Agency Derivatives.

However, the decrease in net interest rate spread on non-Agency RMBS was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, which were replaced with securities at lower yields, offset by a decrease in cost of funds on borrowings. In total, the increase in net interest spread on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment.\nThe increase in net interest spread on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The increase in net interest spread on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The decrease in net interest spread on our mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of the securitization transactions completed in the latter half of 2014.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.4 million of OTTI losses, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in OTTI during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by appreciation in the non-Agency market from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold AFS securities for $3.5 billion with an amortized cost of $3.4 billion, for a net realized gain of $84.4 million. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.1 billion with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion, for a net realized gain $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold AFS securities for $4.4 billion with an amortized cost of $4.5 billion, for a net realized loss of $64.5 million. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.0 billion with an amortized cost of $1.0 billion, for a net realized gain of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that our management believes have higher risk-adjusted returns.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, trading securities experienced unrealized losses of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in change in unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to the realization of gains on trading securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn March 18, 2013, we declared a special dividend pursuant to which we distributed 17,824,647 shares of Silver Bay common stock, on a pro rata basis, to our stockholders of record as of April 2, 2013. The dividend was distributed on or about April 24, 2013. As a result, we recognized $13.7 million of realized gains on the distribution as well as $5.9 million of change in unrealized losses within gain (loss) on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Also included in gain (loss) on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million in dividend income from Silver Bay's $0.01 per share dividend declared on March 21, 2013.\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we recognized $91.8 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $23.3 billion and $17.0 billion notional, respectively, to hedge a portion of our interest rate risk on our short-term repurchase agreements, funding costs, and macro-financing risk and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 68 and 155 notional interest rate swap and swaption positions of $37.4 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $19.6 million and $34.5 million, in 2014 and 2013 respectively, in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $55.4 million in realized losses and $12.3 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions in 2014 and 2013, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\nAlso included in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation losses of $198.5 million and gains of $291.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91,754\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,522\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early termination, agreement maturation and option expiration losses\n</td> <td>(55,389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, at fair value\n</td> <td>(198,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(345,647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nIncluded in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of $17.5 million of losses and $95.3 million of gains, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within these year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 results was the recognition of $30.2 million and $14.0 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $188.8 million and $251.1 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized gains and losses on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and mortgage loan portfolios.\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $17.3 million and losses of $33.8 million, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of $12.6 million and losses of $13.8 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and gains of $4.7 million and losses of $20.0 million on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The gains recorded on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013, were due in part to falling interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to rising interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nServicing Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $128.2 million, which includes servicing fee income of $125.1 million, ancillary fee income of $2.2 million and float income of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized total servicing income of $12.0 million, which includes servicing fee income of $11.8 million and ancillary fee income of $0.2 million. The increase in servicing income for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was the result of the significant growth of our MSR portfolio at the end of 2013.\n(Loss) Gain on Servicing Asset\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $128.4 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $73.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gain on servicing asset of $13.9 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $6.8 million and an increase in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $20.7 million. The increase in (loss) gain on servicing asset for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods combined with changes in interest rates and prepayment assumptions.\nOther (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other income of $18.5 million, which includes $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded other income of $14.6 million, which includes $22.9 million in losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $37.1 million in gains on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.4 million. The increase in other income (decrease in other loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due in part to falling interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nManagement Fees\nWe incurred management fees of $48.8 million and $41.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, which are payable to PRCM Advisers under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. However, these fees were reduced by $4.3 million, on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the contribution transaction entered into with Silver Bay. See further discussion of the management fee calculation as well as this adjustment in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSecuritization Deal Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $4.6 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $2.1 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of a securitization trust, and $2.0 million in upfront costs related to the subordinated debt and excess servicing rights acquired from a securitization trust issued by a third party, which was paid upon settlement of the acquisitions. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\nServicing Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $25.9 million in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSR, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in servicing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $1.8 million. The increase in servicing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods.\nOther Operating Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $56.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, of other operating expenses, which represents an expense ratio of 1.4% and 1.0% of average equity for the respective periods. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the personnel, infrastructure and volume-based transaction costs to support our mortgage loan and MSR activities.\nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $15.5 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our executive officers, including our principal financial officer and general counsel of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel of $6.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nWe have an established accounts payable function and direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services and proprietary technology, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $73.7 million and a provision from income taxes of $84.4 million, respectively. The benefit in 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs, and the provision in 2013 was primarily due to income generated from derivative instruments held in our TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nFinancial Condition\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\nAgency RMBS\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. Government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS

Our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased from 73.0% at December 31, 2014 to 67.7% at December 31, 2015. As a result, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount and total face value has also decreased (as disclosed in Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). When focused on principal and interest securities, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount decreased from 57.3% to 45.9%, and our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total face value decreased from 23.1% to 16.9%. As our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased over the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, we believe these comparable portfolio metrics are reflective of our investment profile, regardless of portfolio size.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\nWithin our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009, many subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve. There remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe following tables present certain information by investment type and, if applicable, their respective underlying loan characteristics for our senior and mezzanine non-Agency RMBS,

securities as trading instruments due to short-term investment objectives. We did not have any U.S. Treasuries on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we held U.S. Treasuries with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion and a fair value of $2.0 billion, classified as trading securities. The unrealized gains included within trading securities were $1.4 million as of December 31, 2014.\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\nWe acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $764.3 million and $500.2 million, respectively, and had outstanding commitments to purchase $286.1 million and $554.8 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively, subject to fallout if the loans do not close. Our intention is to securitize these loans and/or exit through a whole loan sale.\nIn 2013, we acquired a portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We subsequently sold substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had CSL with a carrying value of $11.0 million and $35.6 million remaining.\nAdditionally, as the owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to HUD. As of December 31, 2015, we held Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $36.1 million, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD.\nThe following tables present our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Unrealized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,545\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit sensitive residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>19,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>38,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>812,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Unrealized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit sensitive residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>47,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,184\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>534,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value\nWe purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying residential mortgage loans held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets, are classified as residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts had a carrying value of $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nCommercial Real Estate Assets\nWe originate and purchase commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments. These assets are classified as commercial real estate assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we are the sole certificate holder of a trust entity that holds a commercial real estate loan. The underlying loan held by the trust is consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets and classified as commercial real estate assets. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the trust. Commercial real estate assets are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the assets are deemed impaired. As of December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate assets were comprised of eighteen first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of $661.0 million. We did not have any commercial real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.\nMortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value\nOne of our wholly owned subsidiaries has approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans. We do not directly service mortgage loans, and instead contract with fully licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions for the loans underlying our MSR. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our MSR had a fair market value of $493.7 million and $452.0 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our MSR portfolio included MSR on 245,144 and 224,073 loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $51.4 billion and $44.9 billion, respectively.

consolidated for U.S. GAAP purposes only. The permanent tax differences also include a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments and accretion and amortization from RMBS.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nDividends\nFor the 2015 taxable year, we declared dividends totaling $1.04 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the fiscal year ended 2015, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes.

The Plan provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel, including PRCM Advisers and its affiliates. The Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The Plan provides for grants of common stock, restricted common stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards, subject to a ceiling of 13,000,000 shares. In addition, with respect to awards intended to qualify for relief from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares that may underlie awards over any three-year period to any eligible person may not exceed 1,500,000 as options and 600,000 as other grants. Section 162(m) generally disallows a federal income tax deduction for any publicly held corporation with respect to compensation exceeding $1 million (on a per employee basis) paid in any year to the corporation's chief executive officer or to any of the corporation's three other most highly compensated executive officers, other than its chief financial officer. Because we do not have any employees, management does not believe that Section 162(m) is applicable to us and, therefore, does not currently consider and has not previously considered the effects of Section 162(m) with respect to the granting of awards under the Plan. As such, restricted stock awards granted to certain individuals, as previously disclosed in our proxy statements and other filings with the SEC, have exceeded 600,000 shares over a three year period, as permitted under the Plan. See Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan for further details regarding the Plan.\nShare Repurchase Program\nAs of December 31, 2015, our share repurchase program allowed for the repurchase of up to 25,000,000 shares of our common stock. (Subsequent to year end, our board of directors increased this authorization by 50,000,000 shares, or up to 75,000,000 shares under the program). Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 16,115,000 shares had been repurchased under the program for an aggregate cost of $139.1 million; of these, 13,664,300 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $115.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining 2,450,700 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2013 for a total cost of $23.9 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecast on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls, and that we have the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate assets and other target assets, and for other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held $737.8 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $13.2 billion of AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets, MSR and derivative assets; and $10.8 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 4.1:1.0 to 3.0:1.0. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only also decreased from 3.3:1.0 to 2.5:1.0 due to the repayment of repurchase agreements as a result of sales of AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $40.9 million of unpledged Agency RMBS AFS and Agency Derivatives and $48.9 million of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately $71.7 million. We also had approximately $18.9 million of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, $11.0 million of unpledged CSL and $36.1 million of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we we had approximately $43.9 million of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans, $255.9 million of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately $170.7 million. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the volatile interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have master repurchase agreements in place with 30 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate further counterparties to manage and reduce counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional securities or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Counterparty Exposure(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,381,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>693,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,331,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>974,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe (2)\n</td> <td>1,125,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,950,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia (2)\n</td> <td>500,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,008,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,035,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,932,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the net carrying value of the securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest.

As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2015, TH Insurance had $3.8 billion in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 0.6%, and had an additional $215.0 million of available uncommitted capacity for borrowings. To the extent TH Insurance has uncommitted capacity, it may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the FHLB.\nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represents the most restrictive covenant calculations across the agreements as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total indebtedness to net worth must be less than the specified threshold ratio in the repurchase agreement.

Our RMBS are generally publicly traded and, thus, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and may be financed with credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Within 30 days\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,689,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,013,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 to 59 days\n</td> <td>1,739,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,595,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60 to 89 days\n</td> <td>161,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>903,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 to 119 days\n</td> <td>175,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>120 to 364 days (1)\n</td> <td>242,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,929,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One to three years\n</td> <td>651,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three to five years\n</td> <td>815,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>815,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five to ten years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten years and over\n</td> <td>2,318,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open maturity (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>997,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,793,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,432,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, 120 to 364 days includes the amounts outstanding under the uncommitted mortgage loan warehouse facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries with an open maturity period (i.e., rolling 1-day maturity) renewable at the discretion of either party to the agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately $268.0 million to $737.8 million at December 31, 2015.

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOther Matters\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1 - Business - Other Business - Regulation of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nThe recently enacted Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 contains changes to certain aspects of the U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs. In particular, the act will reduce the maximum allowable value of assets attributable to our TRSs from 25% to 20%, which change will be applicable with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We currently monitor our compliance with this TRS asset test and, in light of this change, we intend to continue to meet the requirement.", "item_7_truncated": "The cost of funds associated with the financing of commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represents financing on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, is not indicative of future cost of funds.\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Average Balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Asset Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Asset Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,202,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,939,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>1,462,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>996,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>403,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts\n</td> <td>1,051,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>15,119,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,891,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>188,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,308,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,142,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) Excludes Agency Derivatives.

We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve. There remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our RMBS portfolio by product type:\n____________________\nMortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income, while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income.\nServicing Income\nTable

securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nThe increase in net yields on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS. The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The decrease in yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the sale of substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. The change in yields on mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of changes in interest rates on mortgage loans securitized throughout 2014.\n____________________\n \u2022 Total indebtedness to net worth must be less than the specified threshold ratio in the repurchase agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our debt to net worth, as defined, was 3.0:1.0 while our threshold ratio, as defined, was 4.5:1.0. \n (2) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average annualized net interest rate spread on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.0% and 2.4%, respectively. \nOther

sheets and statements of comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2015, approximately 86.3% of total assets, or $12.6 billion, and approximately 18.3% of total liabilities, or $2.0 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 16 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices. Although markets for asset-backed securities, including RMBS, have modestly stabilized since the severe dislocations experienced as a result of the financial crisis, these markets continue to experience volatility and, as a result, our assets and liabilities will continue to be subject to valuation adjustment as well as changes in the inputs we use to measure fair value.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Agency RMBS AFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency Derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Agency RMBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hybrid ARMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other low loan balances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,101,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,101,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$85K Max Pools\n</td> <td>1,439,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 and subsequent vintages\n</td> <td>685,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High LTV (predominantly MHA)\n</td> <td>421,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity conversion mortgages\n</td> <td>386,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seasoned (2005 and prior vintages)\n</td> <td>184,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 and subsequent vintages - discount\n</td> <td>323,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low FICO\n</td> <td>277,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-pay lock-out or penalty-based\n</td> <td>44,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,864,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,130,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \nThe following tables present the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur portfolio includes Agency securities, which includes securities with explicit prepayment protection, $85,000 maximum loan balance pools (securities collateralized by loans of less than $85,000 in principal), other low loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $175,000, but more than $85,000 in principal), high LTV ratios (securities collateralized by loans with greater or equal to 80% LTV predominantly comprised of Making Homeownership Affordable, or MHA, pools that consist of borrowers who have refinanced through HARP), home equity conversion mortgages (securities collateralized by reverse mortgages), low FICO scores (lower credit borrowers), and seasoned securities reflecting less prepayment risk due to previously experienced high levels of refinancing.

The increase in servicing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, loss on servicing asset of $3.3 million and $99.6 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $15.2 million and $48.0 million and an increase of $11.9 million and decrease of $51.6 million, respectively, in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $55.3 million and $128.4 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $13.7 million and $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $41.6 million and $73.6 million, respectively. The decrease in loss on servicing asset for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was the result of decreasing prepayment speeds and delinquencies.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value - Unrealized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,545\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit sensitive residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>19,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans\n</td> <td>38,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>812,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net interest rate spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the three months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, was predominantly driven by increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties, as discussed above. The net interest spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with that for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net interest spread on non-Agency RMBS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014,was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, combined with increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties.\n (1) Represents the net carrying value of the securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our RMBS are generally publicly traded and, thus, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nWe are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\nThe net of the underlying residential mortgage loans and the debt held by the securitization trusts discussed above represents the carrying value of the securities that we retained from these securitizations. Because we consolidate these securitization trusts on our consolidated balance sheets, our retained interests are eliminated in consolidation in accordance is U.S. GAAP. However, the carrying value, characteristics and performance of these securities and those of the underlying collateral are relevant to our portfolio as a whole.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average amortized cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,893,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,308,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,202,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,615,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,323,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,939,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coupon interest\n</td> <td>450,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>519,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (premium amortization) discount accretion\n</td> <td>(140,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(162,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,022\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset yield\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \n\nInterest income on residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Additionally, any acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the effective interest method. All residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans are considered past due when they are 30 days past their contractual due date. Interest income recognition is suspended when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for more than 60 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed and subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Loans are restored to accrual status only when contractually current or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate further counterparties to manage and reduce counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional securities or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Government FHA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Government VA/USDA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Conventional Loans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid principal balance (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,450,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,555,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,380,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,386,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of loans\n</td> <td>52,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Coupon\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Loan Age (months)\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Loan Size (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Original Loan-to-Value\n</td> <td>92.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Original FICO\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60+ day delinquencies\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3-Month CPR\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (3) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, while interest expense on Agency Derivatives is included in interest expense on repurchase agreements on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n\nIncluded in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of $17.5 million of losses and $95.3 million of gains, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within these year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 results was the recognition of $30.2 million and $14.0 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $188.8 million and $251.1 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized gains and losses on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and mortgage loan portfolios.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was the result of increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties, which are generally based on a specified margin over one-month LIBOR. The cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014.

For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average annualized net yield on our Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. \nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of Funds (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of Funds (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,467,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,046,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,442,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,764,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,910,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,810,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>917,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,986,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,286,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,657,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,687,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity\nAs opportunities in the residential and commercial mortgage marketplace change, we continue to evolve our business model. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to continue to increase our allocation towards MSR, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets, and decrease our exposure to RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold a number of Agency RMBS, primarily due to widening spreads and our belief that it is prudent to position ourselves with minimal basis and prepayment risk exposure. Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe increase in net interest spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS combined with a decrease in cost of funds due to our extended maturity profile, as discussed above. However, the decrease in net interest rate spread on non-Agency RMBS was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, which were replaced with securities at lower yields, offset by a decrease in cost of funds on borrowings. In total, the increase in net interest spread on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment.\n____________________\nOther (Loss) Income\n____________________\nOn December 19, 2012, we completed the contribution of our portfolio of single-family rental properties to Silver Bay, a newly organized Maryland corporation intended to qualify as a REIT and focused on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family residential properties for rental income and long-term capital appreciation. We contributed our equity interests in the wholly owned subsidiary, Two Harbors Property Investment LLC to Silver Bay, and in exchange for the contribution, received shares of common stock of Silver Bay. Silver Bay completed its IPO of its common stock on December 19, 2012. We distributed shares of Silver Bay common stock we received in the transaction to our stockholders on or about April 24, 2013. Because we will not have any significant continuing involvement in Two Harbors Property Investment LLC, all of the associated operating results were removed from continuing operations and are presented separately as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. No remaining associated operating results were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 Commercial real estate assets; and \nInterest Income Recognition\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately $268.0 million to $737.8 million at December 31, 2015.

Also included in other (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.1 million and $0.5 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\n (1) The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms. \nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Dividend Per Share (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 20, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 22, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 17, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 21, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 18, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 21, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 16, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 20, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 16, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 21, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 17, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 2, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 22, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 17, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 21, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 17, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 27, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 11, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 26, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 23, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 18, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 23, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 18, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 24, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represents the most restrictive covenant calculations across the agreements as of December 31, 2015:\n (3) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average cost of funds on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. \nIn 2014, the U.S. Department of Treasury, or the Treasury, requested comment on the development of a responsible private label securities market. We believe that private capital, through the private label securities market, is a critical component to the long-term stability of the mortgage market and, accordingly, submitted a comment letter in response to the request. The Treasury echoes our sentiment and views a diverse housing finance system with numerous capital streams as critical to promoting competition, market efficiency, and consumer choice.\nCommercial real estate loans held-for-investment are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. Because our commercial real estate loans are collateralized either by real property or by equity interests in the commercial real estate borrower, impairment is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral to the amortized cost of the respective loan. The valuation of the underlying collateral requires significant judgment, which includes assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, credit worthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, overall economic conditions, the broader commercial real estate market, local geographic sub-markets, and other factors deemed necessary. If a loan is determined to be impaired, we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan through a charge to provision for loan losses.

The decrease in net interest spread on our trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was generally the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, investing activities increased our cash balances by approximately $8.0 billion, primarily driven by sales of AFS and trading securities. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nWe have an established accounts payable function and direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our share repurchase program allowed for the repurchase of up to 25,000,000 shares of our common stock. (Subsequent to year end, our board of directors increased this authorization by 50,000,000 shares, or up to 75,000,000 shares under the program). Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 16,115,000 shares had been repurchased under the program for an aggregate cost of $139.1 million; of these, 13,664,300 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $115.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Also included in gain (loss) on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million in dividend income from Silver Bay's $0.01 per share dividend declared on March 21, 2013.\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1 - Business - Other Business - Regulation of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands, except purchase price)\n</td> <td>Principal/Current Face\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net (Discount) Premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized Gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Coupon Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Purchase Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal and interest securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,065,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,704,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,651\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,888,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrid/ARM\n</td> <td>118,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total P&I Securities\n</td> <td>10,183,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,828,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,651\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,016,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-only securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed\n</td> <td>377,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(338,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Other (1)\n</td> <td>2,860,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,639,265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,421,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,333,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,088,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,388\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,292,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation decisions factor in the opportunities in the marketplace, cost of financing and cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation among the target assets in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding period ends:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency RMBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average CPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables provide discount information on our non-Agency RMBS portfolio:\nThe following tables present the components of interest income and net asset yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. Government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nServicing Expenses\nInterest Expense and the Cost of Funds\n\nThe following table presents the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe increase in net interest rate spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The increase in net interest spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily the result of an increase in the outstanding balance of FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS securities at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nGeneral\nThe key macroeconomic factors that impact our business are home prices and the employment and interest rate environments. Home prices increased modestly throughout 2015, and are expected to gradually appreciate over the next several years. Credit standards remain tight, despite a modest easing in recent months, and have limited borrowers' ability to refinance their mortgages notwithstanding low interest rates and government programs that promote refinancing. Employment market conditions remain relatively solid as jobless claims, unemployment and payroll data are showing stable trends, although underemployment levels remain stubbornly high and new job creation has been disappointing. Other than LTV ratios and cash reserves, we believe employment is the most powerful determinant of homeowners' ongoing likelihood to pay their mortgages. Home price performance and employment are particularly important to our non-Agency portfolio.\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\n (3) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our average cost of funds on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 0.5% for both respective periods, compared to 0.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \n\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n (2) Exposure to European- and Asian-domiciled banks and their U.S. subsidiaries. \nIn 2013, we acquired a portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We subsequently sold substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had CSL with a carrying value of $11.0 million and $35.6 million remaining.\n\n (1) Average purchase price utilized carrying value for weighting purposes. If current face were utilized for weighting purposes, the average purchase price for senior, mezzanine, and total non-Agency RMBS, excluding our non-Agency interest-only portfolio, would be $48.92, $75.63, and $55.80, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and $52.11, $65.59, and $54.78, respectively at December 31, 2014. \n\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n____________________\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. Additionally, as an owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. We held a small portfolio of these Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2015, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD. We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, nor the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements negatively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments and MSR, however, negatively affected our financial results.\nAlso included in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation gains of $156.2 million and $101.2 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized changes in unrealized valuation losses of $116.7 million and gains of $198.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe underlying mortgage loans collateralizing our non-Agency RMBS are located across the U.S. The following table presents the five largest geographic concentrations of the mortgages collateralizing these RMBS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a REIT, as defined under the Code.\n\nRegulatory and legislative actions taken in the past few years in an effort to improve economic conditions and increase liquidity in the financial markets, as well as other actions related to the fall-out from the financial and foreclosure crises, continue to impact the market. Regulatory actions that could affect the value and availability of our target assets, either positively or negatively, include: attempts by the U.S. government to further simplify the refinancing process to allow more borrowers to refinance into lower interest rate mortgage loans; the streamlined loan modification initiative for borrowers that are 90+ days delinquent implemented by the GSEs; the real estate owned, or REO, -to-rental program supported by the GSEs; the extension of both the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program 2.0, or HARP 2.0, through 2016; the strict ability-to-repay\u201d and qualified mortgage\u201d regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB; the enforcement of and potential liability associated with TRID; and the application of the risk retention requirements of Section 15G of the Exchange Act.\n____________________\n\nAgency RMBS\nCredit losses\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n____________________\nWithin our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business, we acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions with the intent to securitize the loans through the issuance of non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. Our intention is to retain the related subordinated securities, representing the credit risk piece associated with these deals. We also hold a small legacy portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default on CSL than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans or provide direct financing to lenders; rather, through our mortgage loan conduit we contract with originators to acquire loans they originate that meet our purchase criteria.\nInterest Income and Average Portfolio Yield\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\nClassification and Valuation of Collateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts\nThe following table provides details of our changes in stockholders' equity from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015:\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $5.2 million and $17.5 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was the recognition of $7.6 million and $30.2 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $177.8 million and $188.8 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and loan portfolios.\n \u2022 Cash flows from financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, financing activities decreased our cash balance by approximately $6.3 billion, primarily driven by repayment of repurchase agreements due to sales of AFS and trading securities. \nWe are party to a management agreement with PRCM Advisers, pursuant to which PRCM Advisers is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses from us. We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by PRCM Advisers to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by PRCM Advisers as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us, and (ii) any amounts for personnel of PRCM Advisers' affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\n (1) Core Earnings is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding realized gains and losses\u201d (impairment losses, realized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio, amortization of business combination intangible assets, reserve expense for representation and warranty obligations on MSR and certain upfront costs related to securitization transactions) and unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses\u201d (unrealized gains and losses on the aggregate portfolio). As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Core Earnings is provided for purposes of comparability to other peer issuers. \nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts, compared to $1.3 million and $4.6 million for the same periods in 2014. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other income of $18.5 million, which includes $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded other income of $14.6 million, which includes $22.9 million in losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $37.1 million in gains on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.4 million. The increase in other income (decrease in other loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due in part to falling interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014.\n (1) Average annualized yield incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change. \nThe net interest rate spread on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represents interest income, net of interest expense, on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, is not indicative of future spreads.\nInterest Income and Average Portfolio Yield\n\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nServicing Expenses\n \u2022 Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities\nRepurchase Agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are also party to contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with brokers, underwriters and counterparties to repurchase agreements and investors in the RMBS we issue and the loans underlying our MSR assets. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held $737.8 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $13.2 billion of AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets, MSR and derivative assets; and $10.8 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 4.1:1.0 to 3.0:1.0. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only also decreased from 3.3:1.0 to 2.5:1.0 due to the repayment of repurchase agreements as a result of sales of AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n (2) Cost of financing includes swap interest rate spread. \n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2015, TH Insurance had $3.8 billion in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 0.6%, and had an additional $215.0 million of available uncommitted capacity for borrowings. To the extent TH Insurance has uncommitted capacity, it may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the FHLB.\nWe purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying debt held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets, is classified as collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts had a carrying value of $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% for both periods. The stated maturity dates for all collateralized borrowings are greater than five years from December 31, 2015.\n (1) Average balance represents average total repurchase agreements and FHLB advances on AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and average collateralized borrowings for residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nThe following tables present the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nFinancial Condition\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average yield on our Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. \nThe following tables present the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by investment type on our AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by our stockholders on May 14, 2015. The Plan provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel, including PRCM Advisers and its affiliates. The Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The Plan provides for grants of common stock, restricted common stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards, subject to a ceiling of 13,000,000 shares. In addition, with respect to awards intended to qualify for relief from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares that may underlie awards over any three-year period to any eligible person may not exceed 1,500,000 as options and 600,000 as other grants. Section 162(m) generally disallows a federal income tax deduction for any publicly held corporation with respect to compensation exceeding $1 million (on a per employee basis) paid in any year to the corporation's chief executive officer or to any of the corporation's three other most highly compensated executive officers, other than its chief financial officer. Because we do not have any employees, management does not believe that Section 162(m) is applicable to us and, therefore, does not currently consider and has not previously considered the effects of Section 162(m) with respect to the granting of awards under the Plan. As such, restricted stock awards granted to certain individuals, as previously disclosed in our proxy statements and other filings with the SEC, have exceeded 600,000 shares over a three year period, as permitted under the Plan. See Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan for further details regarding the Plan.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\n____________________\nSecuritization Deal Costs\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. An entity is allowed to measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying collateralized financing entity, or CFE, it consolidates using the fair value of either the CFE's financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. As the Company's securitization trusts are considered qualifying CFEs, the Company determines the fair value of these residential mortgage loans based on the fair value of its collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and its retained interests from the Company's on-balance sheet securitizations (eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP), as the fair value of these instruments is more observable.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n____________________\nThe following table summarizes dividends declared for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and their related tax characterization (per share amounts):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $4.6 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $2.1 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of a securitization trust, and $2.0 million in upfront costs related to the subordinated debt and excess servicing rights acquired from a securitization trust issued by a third party, which was paid upon settlement of the acquisitions. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\n\n\nManagement Fees\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing providers. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other RMBS instruments, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency RMBS. We also typically receive two vendor quotes for the residential mortgage loans and MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (i.e., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For residential mortgage loans and MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, address, LTV ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields, securitization economics and trading levels. Additionally for MSR, pricing providers will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nNon-Agency RMBS\nTotal interest expense increased from $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased interest expense on collateralized borrowings due to the completion of three securitization transactions in 2014, offset by a decrease in the outstanding balance under repurchase agreements and increase in the outstanding balance under FHLB advances, which provide lower financing rates.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we recognized $91.8 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $23.3 billion and $17.0 billion notional, respectively, to hedge a portion of our interest rate risk on our short-term repurchase agreements, funding costs, and macro-financing risk and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 68 and 155 notional interest rate swap and swaption positions of $37.4 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $19.6 million and $34.5 million, in 2014 and 2013 respectively, in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $55.4 million in realized losses and $12.3 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions in 2014 and 2013, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\nWe incurred management fees of $48.8 million and $41.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, which are payable to PRCM Advisers under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. However, these fees were reduced by $4.3 million, on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the contribution transaction entered into with Silver Bay. See further discussion of the management fee calculation as well as this adjustment in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur RMBS investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\n (2) FICO represents a mortgage industry accepted credit score of a borrower, which was developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. \n____________________\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $73.7 million and a provision from income taxes of $84.4 million, respectively. The benefit in 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs, and the provision in 2013 was primarily due to income generated from derivative instruments held in our TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nOther Operating Expenses\n\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nThere have also been a number of legislative proposals aimed at eventually winding down or phasing out the GSEs. It continues to remain uncertain if any proposal will ultimately become legislation, as recently these efforts appear to have little momentum in Congress. We will continue to monitor these and other regulatory and policy activities closely.\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and net asset yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe interest rate environment remained volatile in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the Federal Reserve announced a rate hike in December for the first time in eight years. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term, however, as the Federal Reserve has suggested it will take a measured and conservative approach to further interest rate decisions. Additionally, it appears the Federal Reserve will continue to reinvest its mortgage-backed security principal repayments for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and Agency Derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nAs of December 31, 2015, our stockholders' equity was $3.6 billion and our book value per share was $10.11. As of December 31, 2014, our stockholders' equity was $4.1 billion and our book value per share was $11.10.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe majority of our non-Agency RMBS were rated at December 31, 2015. Note that credit ratings are based on the par value of the non-Agency RMBS, whereas the distressed non-Agency RMBS assets in our portfolio were acquired at a heavily discounted price. The following table summarizes the credit ratings of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, based on the Bloomberg Index Rating, a composite of each of the four major credit rating agencies (i.e., DBRS Ltd., Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poor's Corporation and Fitch, Inc.), as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n (4) Three-month CPR is reflective of the prepayment speed on the underlying securitization; however, it does not necessarily indicate the proceeds received on our investment tranche. Proceeds received for each security are dependent on the position of the individual security within the structure of each deal. \n\nThe increase in net interest spread on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The increase in net interest spread on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The decrease in net interest spread on our mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of the securitization transactions completed in the latter half of 2014.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our RMBS assets and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency RMBS rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both brokers and independent pricing providers by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge broker quotes and valuations from third-party pricing providers to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of residential mortgage loans and MSR based upon the average of prices received from independent providers, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $8.8 million and a benefit from income taxes of $16.5 million, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $11.7 million and $73.7 million for the same periods in 2014. The provision recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities held in our TRSs. Conversely, the benefit recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nThe credit support built into non-Agency RMBS deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection from potential credit losses for more senior tranches. We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency RMBS provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency RMBS on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\n____________________\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $5.0 billion of repurchase agreements, and the term to maturity ranged from three days to over 6 months. Repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of 1.10% and weighted average remaining maturities of 35 days as of December 31, 2015.\n (1) Interest expense on borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, are calculated based on rates at December 31, 2015. \nNet Economic Interests in Consolidated Securitization Trusts\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 28 and 97 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $12.7 billion and $60.1 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $8.7 million and $41.0 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $101.1 million and $226.2 million in realized losses on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, including early termination penalties. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 21 and 68 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $11.0 billion and $37.4 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $14.1 million and $19.6 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $3.7 million and $55.4 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\n (1) Net interest rate spread does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our total average net interest rate spread on the assets shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, compared to 2.2% and 2.5% for the same periods in 2014. \n (2) These yields have not been adjusted for cost of delay and cost to carry purchase premiums. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $40.9 million of unpledged Agency RMBS AFS and Agency Derivatives and $48.9 million of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately $71.7 million. We also had approximately $18.9 million of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, $11.0 million of unpledged CSL and $36.1 million of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we we had approximately $43.9 million of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans, $255.9 million of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately $170.7 million. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income (loss) to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted as trading instruments. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive (loss) income were $213.9 million and for the three months ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $79.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $42.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities were $496.7 million and for the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $411.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $578.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe originate and purchase commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments. These assets are classified as commercial real estate assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we are the sole certificate holder of a trust entity that holds a commercial real estate loan. The underlying loan held by the trust is consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets and classified as commercial real estate assets. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the trust. Commercial real estate assets are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the assets are deemed impaired. As of December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate assets were comprised of eighteen first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of $661.0 million. We did not have any commercial real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.\n\nFrom time to time, we hold U.S. Treasuries in a TRS and classify these securities as trading instruments due to short-term investment objectives. We did not have any U.S. Treasuries on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we held U.S. Treasuries with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion and a fair value of $2.0 billion, classified as trading securities. The unrealized gains included within trading securities were $1.4 million as of December 31, 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other loss of $1.4 million and other income of $18.5 million, which includes $9.4 million and $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $11.5 million and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other (loss) income for the both three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.2 million and $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The increase in other loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $12.6 million and $85.6 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $14.1 billion and $16.1 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $32.2 million and $91.8 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $22.0 billion and $23.3 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency RMBS portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility. As such, we have diversified into several target assets that capitalize on our prepayment and credit expertise.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, trading securities experienced unrealized losses of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in change in unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to the realization of gains on trading securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our RMBS and commercial real estate assets, we have three facilities that provide short-term financing for our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and other commercial real estate assets. An overview of the facilities is presented in the tables below:\n\n(Loss) Gain on Servicing Asset\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and that we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. In addition, we have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from our external manager's analytical and portfolio management expertise and infrastructure. We believe that our significant focus on the mortgage market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\n____________________\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.4 million of OTTI losses, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in OTTI during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by appreciation in the non-Agency market from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we sold AFS securities for $3.3 billion and $7.0 billion with an amortized cost of $3.2 billion and $6.6 billion, for net realized gains of $109.5 million and $369.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $2.0 billion with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion, resulting in net realized gains of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not hold or sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2015. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we sold AFS securities for $303.1 million and $3.5 billion with an amortized cost of $278.6 million and $3.4 billion, for net realized gains of $24.5 million and $84.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.1 billion with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion, for a net realized gain of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We did not sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2014. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that our management believes have higher risk-adjusted returns.\n (1) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n (1) As of December 31, 2015, 120 to 364 days includes the amounts outstanding under the uncommitted mortgage loan warehouse facilities. \n____________________\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our RMBS assets through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and through short- and long-term advances from the FHLB. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency RMBS, with less liquidity and exposure to credit risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. We may also finance our U.S. Treasuries, which we hold from time to time for trading purposes, and our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets is the most meaningful leverage measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the sustainability and price of our financing, diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 3.0 to 5.0 times to finance our RMBS portfolio, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the make-up of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from common stock offerings we conduct. See the section titled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income, rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the valuation includes unobservable market data inputs (prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and discount rates).\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the average annualized net yield on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to 3.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $56.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, of other operating expenses, which represents an expense ratio of 1.4% and 1.0% of average equity for the respective periods. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the personnel, infrastructure and volume-based transaction costs to support our mortgage loan and MSR activities.\n\nOur interest income on our Agency and non-Agency RMBS is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nThe following analysis focuses on financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $8.3 million and $28.1 million, respectively, in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSR, compared to $1.3 million and $25.9 million for the same periods in 2014. Included in servicing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to a decrease in the MSR representation and warranty reserve of $5.1 million and MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $1.8 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by the reduction in the MSR representation and warranty reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n (4) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThe following analysis focuses on financial results during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n\n\nWe evaluate credit risk on our residential mortgage loans through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis and through on-going asset surveillance.\nThe size of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio has decreased by $1.2 billion since December 31, 2014 as we sold a number of securities, many of which were considered subprime. Our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased from 73.0% at December 31, 2014 to 67.7% at December 31, 2015. As a result, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount and total face value has also decreased (as disclosed in Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). When focused on principal and interest securities, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount decreased from 57.3% to 45.9%, and our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total face value decreased from 23.1% to 16.9%. As our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased over the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, we believe these comparable portfolio metrics are reflective of our investment profile, regardless of portfolio size.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\n\n____________________\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. Fair value is generally determined based on current secondary market pricing or cash flow models using market-based yield requirements.\n\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and Agency Derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe increase in net yields on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS. However, the decrease in net yields on non-Agency RMBS was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with securities at lower yields.\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nYields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment were relatively consistent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as rates on prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans were generally flat over the course of the past two years. The yields on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represent interest income on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, are not indicative of future yields.\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that are pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances.\nThe following tables present our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing shift. As previously discussed, our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\n____________________\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nInflation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $128.4 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $73.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gain on servicing asset of $13.9 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $6.8 million and an increase in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $20.7 million. The increase in (loss) gain on servicing asset for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods combined with changes in interest rates and prepayment assumptions.\nTrading Securities, at Fair Value\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $128.2 million, which includes servicing fee income of $125.1 million, ancillary fee income of $2.2 million and float income of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized total servicing income of $12.0 million, which includes servicing fee income of $11.8 million and ancillary fee income of $0.2 million. The increase in servicing income for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was the result of the significant growth of our MSR portfolio at the end of 2013.\n\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded losses of $4.0 million and gains of $14.3 million on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of losses of $3.7 million and gains of $16.0 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and losses of $0.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, we did not recognize any OTTI losses, but for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $0.5 million in OTTI losses. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.2 million and $0.4 million in OTTI losses, respectively. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our MSR portfolio included MSR on 245,144 and 224,073 loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $51.4 billion and $44.9 billion, respectively. The following tables summarize certain characteristics of the loans underlying our MSR at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe are externally managed by PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River, a global multi-strategy asset management firm providing comprehensive portfolio management, transparency and liquidity to institutional and high net worth investors.\n\n (2) Contractual obligation for the management fee is estimated through the contract expiration date of October 28, 2016, inclusive of the termination fee as defined in the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers. Disclosure assumes agreement not renewed or terminated without cause. \n\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets.\n\nThe recently enacted Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 contains changes to certain aspects of the U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs. In particular, the act will reduce the maximum allowable value of assets attributable to our TRSs from 25% to 20%, which change will be applicable with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We currently monitor our compliance with this TRS asset test and, in light of this change, we intend to continue to meet the requirement.\n\nWe incurred management fees of $12.3 million and $50.3 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and $12.2 million and $48.8 million for the same periods in 2014, which are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. See further discussion of the management fee calculation in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nOur non-Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine tranches of mortgage-backed securities, and excludes the retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, as they are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables provide investment information on our non-Agency RMBS as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nThe following table summarizes the number of months until the next reset for our floating or adjustable rate Agency RMBS AFS portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and may be financed with credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $9.7 million and $12.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, trading securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $1.4 million, compared to a change in unrealized gains of $4.2 million and losses of $2.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively. We did not hold any trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in change in unrealized losses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was driven by the sale of our U.S. Treasuries and corresponding recognition of realized gains during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We rely on internal models corroborated by quotations from a third party to determine these fair values. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nWe expect that a material percentage of our assets will remain in whole-pool Agency RMBS in light of the long-term attractiveness of the asset class and in order to continue to satisfy the requirements of our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Interest-only Agency securities and MSR also provide a complementary investment and risk-management strategy to our principal and interest Agency RMBS investments. Risk-adjusted returns in our Agency RMBS portfolio may decline if we are required to pay higher purchase premiums due to lower interest rates or additional liquidity in the market. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's prior quantitative easing programs and continued reinvestment of its mortgage-backed security principal repayments and other policy changes may impact the returns of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\n____________________\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate assets and other target assets, and for other general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Maintaining best in class\u201d investment, corporate governance, investor relations and disclosure practices. We attribute our growth to portfolio alpha generation, innovation and best practice in corporate governance and disclosure. \nFair Value Measurement\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, trading securities, mortgage loans, MSR and collateralized borrowings may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\n (2) Includes loans issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or private investors. \n\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrealized fair value gains on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, positively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on certain U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments due to their short-term investment objectives, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, net economic interests in securitizations and MSR.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nAlso included in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation losses of $198.5 million and gains of $291.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n \u2022 MSR; \nThe following table summarizes the carrying values and credit ratings of our net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts, based on a composite of credit ratings received from DBRS Ltd., Standard & Poor's Corporation and/or Fitch, Inc. upon issuance of the securities, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans and to own and manage MSR.\nSubstantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOur collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net (loss) income. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $3.8 billion of FHLB advances. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average term to maturity of our FHLB advances was 154 months, ranging from approximately 12 months to 20 years. The weighted average cost of funds for our advances was 0.58% at December 31, 2015.\n\nFrom time to time, we also hold U.S. Treasuries for trading purposes. Our trading securities are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If our RMBS AFS were also classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our GAAP net income (loss).\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $764.3 million and $500.2 million, respectively, and had outstanding commitments to purchase $286.1 million and $554.8 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively, subject to fallout if the loans do not close. Our intention is to securitize these loans and/or exit through a whole loan sale.\n (1) Average balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities, trading securities, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives and average unpaid principal balance, adjusted for purchase price changes, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nInterest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nYields on AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net yields on AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was predominantly driven by the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value. The increase in net yields on Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment. The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. We did not recognize any interest income on trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading security position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\n (1) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives and excludes repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. \n____________________\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $11.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of $8.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and gains of $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gains (losses) recorded on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\n (4) Net of interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nOur 2015 efforts focused on three strategic objectives that we believe will position us for long-term success.\nAdditionally, as the owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to HUD. As of December 31, 2015, we held Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $36.1 million, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD.\n (2) Includes repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries with an open maturity period (i.e., rolling 1-day maturity) renewable at the discretion of either party to the agreements. \n \u2022 Liquidity must be greater than the sum of 1.5% of indebtedness related to Agency securities and 5.0% of total indebtedness, excluding indebtedness related to Agency securities. As of December 31, 2015, our liquidity, as defined, was $1.1 billion. \nThe following tables present the components of our comprehensive (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2013:\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total servicing income of $32.8 million and $127.4 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $31.9 million and $123.8 million, ancillary fee income of $0.5 million and $2.1 million, and float income of $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $31.6 million and $128.2 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $30.7 million and $125.1 million, and ancillary fee income of $0.6 million and $2.2 million, and float income of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with that for the same periods in 2014 due to similar average MSR portfolio sizes during the respective periods.\nOur Agency RMBS and MSR portfolios are subject to inherent prepayment risk. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR to deteriorate, and our fixed coupon Agency pools to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. As previously discussed, despite the Federal Reserve raising rates in December, the low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our security selection process, positions us to ideally respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nOur net interest income includes income from our RMBS portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and income from our residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs, and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency RMBS and in our mortgage loan and commercial real estate portfolios.\nNet Interest Income\n\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency and non-Agency RMBS AFS, Agency Derivatives and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of a decrease in the outstanding balance under repurchase agreements and increase in the outstanding balance under FHLB advances, resulting in our ability to extend our maturity profile without an increase in financing rates. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of the securitization transactions completed in the latter half of 2014.\n (4) Net of interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThe permanent tax differences recorded in 2014 and 2015 include a recurring difference in the income recognized from the securitization trusts that are consolidated for U.S. GAAP purposes only. The permanent tax differences also include a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments and accretion and amortization from RMBS.\n____________________\nEquity Incentive Plan\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2015, our net yield realized on the portfolio was higher than previous periods. Yields and net interest spreads on Agency RMBS and MSR are generally higher than recent quarters, while yields and spreads on non-Agency RMBS has generally decreased. Net yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations have been relatively consistent. Additionally, our cost of financing has decreased as a result of lower swap spread. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our target assets, including Agency and non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment, net of collateralized borrowings, in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $15.5 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our executive officers, including our principal financial officer and general counsel of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel of $6.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\n (1) Average balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities, trading securities and Agency Derivatives and average unpaid principal balance, adjusted for purchase price changes, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n___________________\n\n (4) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value\nWe have not participated in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities. However, as of December 31, 2015, we had unfunded commitments on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment of $52.2 million to be used for future fundings to borrowers, generally to finance lease-related or capital expenditures.\nIncluded in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $2.1 million and $5.0 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $6.6 million and $27.8 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $142.2 million and $149.6 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments.\n (1) Includes loans issued by Ginnie Mae. \nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, repurchase agreements and FHLB advances had the following characteristics:\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2016 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\n \u2022 Executing business diversification opportunities across residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets. We continue to pursue a variety of opportunities that leverage our core competencies of credit and prepayment risk management. We acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions and have established a nonconforming loan securitization program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we meaningfully increased the number of sellers in our network and completed seven securitizations. Within our MSR business, we continue to purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. During 2015, we expanded our flow-sale arrangements within our originator partner network. In addition, we originate and acquire senior and mezzanine commercial real estate assets. These assets are U.S. domiciled and are secured by a diverse mix of property types including office, retail, multifamily and hotel properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans. We are taking a measured approach as we diversify, keeping true to our strategic long-term plans and our core strengths. \nTotal interest income, including interest income on Agency Derivatives, decreased from $163.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $139.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to sales of AFS securities in 2015, offset by purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015. Conversely, total interest income increased from $606.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $628.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015, offset by sales of AFS securities in 2015.\n \u2022 Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.  We generally view our target assets in three strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets with inherent credit risk including non-Agency RMBS, net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans. Our commercial strategy, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, includes as target assets first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, b-notes and preferred equity. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the average annualized net yield on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to 3.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe also monitor exposure to counterparties involved in our mortgage loan conduit and MSR businesses. In connection with securitization transactions and MSR assets, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the investors in the RMBS we issue or the loans underlying the MSR we own. If the representations and warranties that we are required to make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of these businesses. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nResults of Operations\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by vintage and prepayment protection:\nThe U.S. economy continues to navigate headwinds that include global economic lethargy, specifically in China; geopolitical unrest across various regions worldwide; the ongoing European debt crisis; quantitative easing by the European Central Bank; and persistently high underemployment.\nOn December 16, 2015, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, bringing our total 2015 cash dividends declared to $1.04 per diluted share. Our book value per diluted common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $10.11 at December 31, 2015, a decrease from $11.10 book value per diluted common share at December 31, 2014. During this twelve month period, we recognized a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $496.7 million and declared cash dividends of $378.3 million, driving the overall decrease in book value.\nFor the 2015 taxable year, we declared dividends totaling $1.04 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the fiscal year ended 2015, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes. The following table presents cash dividends declared on our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n (2) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n\n (2) Cost of funds by investment type is based on the underlying investment type of the asset assigned as collateral. Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, compared to 1.7% and 1.5% for the same periods in 2014. \nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $6.8 million and $22.9 million, compared to $4.0 million and $15.5 million of costs for the same periods in 2014. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel of $0.2 million and $1.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and $0.2 million and $1.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel, of $0.8 million and $4.4 million, compared to $1.6 million and $6.6 million for the same periods in 2014.\n\n (3) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, while interest expense on Agency Derivatives is included in interest expense on repurchase agreements on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n (2) Cost of funds by investment type is based on the underlying investment type of the asset assigned as collateral. Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. \n \u2022 Managing a portfolio of RMBS to generate attractive returns with balanced risks. We operate a hybrid REIT model, diversifying our portfolio across Agency and non-Agency RMBS in combination with derivative hedging instruments. We manage to an overall low level of interest rate exposure and leverage. We believe effectively managing an appropriate balance of risks within our portfolio is critical to providing an attractive return to our stockholders and our ability to adjust our allocations and deploy capital across sectors allow us to optimize portfolio results over time. ", "item_7_text": "The cost of funds associated with the financing of commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represents financing on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, is not indicative of future cost of funds.\n (2) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our average annualized net interest rate spread on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.0% and 2.9% , respectively, compared to 3.0% for both of the same periods in 2014. \nWe have an established accounts payable function and direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services and proprietary technology, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nWithin our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009, many subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve. There remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our RMBS portfolio by product type:\n____________________\nMortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value\nWhen the estimated fair value of an AFS security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in GAAP net income (loss). The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors. Consideration is given to whether we (i) have the intent to sell the investment securities, (ii) are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery, or (iii) do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities. Investments with unrealized losses are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time, to maturity if necessary, sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments. If an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security, the security is further analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, is then recognized in GAAP net income, while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income.\nServicing Income\nOur reported GAAP net income was $210.7 million ($0.59 per diluted weighted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and our reported GAAP net income was $492.2 million ($1.35 per diluted weighted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to GAAP net loss of $37.0 million ($(0.10) per weighted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and GAAP net income of $167.1 million ($0.46 per weighted share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecast on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls, and that we have the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\n\n (2) These yields have not been adjusted for cost of delay and cost to carry purchase premiums. \n____________________\nThe following table provides the quarterly average balances, the quarter-end balances, and the maximum balances at any month-end within that quarterly period, of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances (total borrowings) for the three months ended December 31, 2015, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nThe following table presents the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by investment type on our AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments.\nThe increase in net yields on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS. The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The decrease in yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the sale of substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. The change in yields on mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of changes in interest rates on mortgage loans securitized throughout 2014.\n____________________\n \u2022 Total indebtedness to net worth must be less than the specified threshold ratio in the repurchase agreement. As of December 31, 2015, our debt to net worth, as defined, was 3.0:1.0 while our threshold ratio, as defined, was 4.5:1.0. \n (2) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average annualized net interest rate spread on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.0% and 2.4%, respectively. \nOther Matters\n\nCollateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are at fair value and, therefore, our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At December 31, 2015, approximately 86.3% of total assets, or $12.6 billion, and approximately 18.3% of total liabilities, or $2.0 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 16 - Fair Value to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices. Although markets for asset-backed securities, including RMBS, have modestly stabilized since the severe dislocations experienced as a result of the financial crisis, these markets continue to experience volatility and, as a result, our assets and liabilities will continue to be subject to valuation adjustment as well as changes in the inputs we use to measure fair value.\n (2) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \nThe following tables present the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur portfolio includes Agency securities, which includes securities with explicit prepayment protection, $85,000 maximum loan balance pools (securities collateralized by loans of less than $85,000 in principal), other low loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $175,000, but more than $85,000 in principal), high LTV ratios (securities collateralized by loans with greater or equal to 80% LTV predominantly comprised of Making Homeownership Affordable, or MHA, pools that consist of borrowers who have refinanced through HARP), home equity conversion mortgages (securities collateralized by reverse mortgages), low FICO scores (lower credit borrowers), and seasoned securities reflecting less prepayment risk due to previously experienced high levels of refinancing. We believe these RMBS characteristics reduce the prepayment risk to the portfolio.\n \u2022 Cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating activities decreased our cash balances by approximately $1.9 billion, primarily driven by purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, offset by our financial results for the year. \nThe following tables provide reconciliations of our GAAP net (loss) income to our taxable (loss) income split between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $16.1 million and $64.2 million, respectively, of other operating expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of 1.7% and 1.6% of average equity, compared to $14.9 million and $56.2 million of expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of 1.5% and 1.4% of average equity, for the same periods in 2014. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the personnel and infrastructure to support our residential mortgage loan, MSR and commercial real estate activities, as well as a decrease in our average equity balance due to share repurchases and a comprehensive loss recognized for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to comprehensive income for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\n____________________\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold AFS securities for $3.5 billion with an amortized cost of $3.4 billion, for a net realized gain of $84.4 million. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.1 billion with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion, for a net realized gain $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold AFS securities for $4.4 billion with an amortized cost of $4.5 billion, for a net realized loss of $64.5 million. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.0 billion with an amortized cost of $1.0 billion, for a net realized gain of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that our management believes have higher risk-adjusted returns.\nServicing Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $25.9 million in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSR, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in servicing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $1.8 million. The increase in servicing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, loss on servicing asset of $3.3 million and $99.6 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $15.2 million and $48.0 million and an increase of $11.9 million and decrease of $51.6 million, respectively, in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $55.3 million and $128.4 million, respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $13.7 million and $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $41.6 million and $73.6 million, respectively. The decrease in loss on servicing asset for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was the result of decreasing prepayment speeds and delinquencies.\nThe decrease in net interest rate spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the three months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, was predominantly driven by increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties, as discussed above. The net interest spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with that for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net interest spread on non-Agency RMBS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014,was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, combined with increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties.\n (1) Represents the net carrying value of the securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest. Payables due to broker counterparties for unsettled securities purchases are not included in the amounts presented above. However, at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not have any such payables. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $17.3 million and losses of $33.8 million, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of $12.6 million and losses of $13.8 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and gains of $4.7 million and losses of $20.0 million on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The gains recorded on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013, were due in part to falling interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to rising interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of a decrease in the outstanding balance under repurchase agreements and increase in the outstanding balance under FHLB advances, which provide lower financing rates. The cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three months ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily the result of an increase in the outstanding balance of FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations.\nTotal interest income, including interest income on Agency Derivatives, has increased from $568.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $606.7 million for the the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the completion of three securitization transactions in 2014 as well as increases in yields on interest-only Agency RMBS.\n \u2022 Residential mortgage loans; \nSecuritization Deal Costs\n (1) Fixed Other represents weighted-average coupon interest-only securities that are not generally used for our interest-rate risk management purposes. These securities pay variable coupon interest based on the weighted average of the fixed rates of the underlying loans of the security, less the weighted average rates of the applicable issued principal and interest securities. \nNet yields on Agency RMBS AFS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same periods in 2014. The decrease in net yields on non-Agency RMBS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014,was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value.\nWe also evaluate credit risk on our commercial real estate assets through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes valuing the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, borrowing entity or loan sponsor. We also assess the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties, and the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. We evaluate each commercial real estate asset for impairment at least quarterly and may record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, if deemed impaired.\n (1) Includes the retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n \u2022 Net worth must be greater than the sum of $1.75 billion plus 40% of the aggregate net cash proceeds of any additional equity issuances made and capital contributions received. As of December 31, 2015, our net worth, as defined, was $3.6 billion. \nAlthough our Agency portfolio is supported by U.S. government agency and federally chartered corporation guarantees of payment of principal and interest, we are exposed to credit risk in our non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets.\n\nThe following tables present certain information by investment type and, if applicable, their respective underlying loan characteristics for our senior and mezzanine non-Agency RMBS, excluding our non-Agency interest-only portfolio, at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $737.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $40.9 million of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and $48.9 million of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from the Company's on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately $71.7 million. We also had approximately $18.9 million of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, $11.0 million of unpledged CSL, $36.1 million of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $43.9 million of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans and $255.9 million of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately $170.7 million. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\n (1) Net interest rate spread does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our total average net interest rate spread on the assets shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. \n\nManagement Fees\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our RMBS are generally publicly traded and, thus, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the volatile interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nOther (Loss) Income\nTotal interest expense increased from $31.7 million and $107.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 to $36.6 million and $142.2 million for the same periods in 2015, due primarily to increased interest expense on collateralized borrowings due to the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015.\nFor non-Agency RMBS purchased at a discount, we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. We limit the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest, and other cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the initial investment. The excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected (nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve) is not recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments.\nWe are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\nThe net of the underlying residential mortgage loans and the debt held by the securitization trusts discussed above represents the carrying value of the securities that we retained from these securitizations. Because we consolidate these securitization trusts on our consolidated balance sheets, our retained interests are eliminated in consolidation in accordance is U.S. GAAP. However, the carrying value, characteristics and performance of these securities and those of the underlying collateral are relevant to our portfolio as a whole.\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \n\nInterest income on residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Additionally, any acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the effective interest method. All residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans are considered past due when they are 30 days past their contractual due date. Interest income recognition is suspended when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for more than 60 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed and subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Loans are restored to accrual status only when contractually current or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured.\n\nOur three-month average CPR experienced by Agency RMBS AFS owned by us as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, on an annualized basis, was 10.2% and 7.4%, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements, interest expense on repurchase agreements, our non-cancelable office lease and management fees payable under our management agreement:\nImpairment of Commercial Real Estate Loans Held-for-Investment\nThe following table provides the three-month weighted average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our Agency RMBS throughout 2015:\nCounterparty exposure and leverage ratio\nWe offset a portion of the Agency exposure to prepayment speeds through our non-Agency portfolio. Our non-Agency RMBS yields are expected to increase if prepayment rates on such assets exceed our prepayment assumptions. To the extent that prepayment speeds increase due to macroeconomic factors, we expect to benefit from the ability to recognize the income from the heavily discounted RMBS prices that principally arose from credit or payment default expectations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have master repurchase agreements in place with 30 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate further counterparties to manage and reduce counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional securities or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\n (3) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, while interest expense on Agency Derivatives is included in interest expense on repurchase agreements on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n\nIncluded in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of $17.5 million of losses and $95.3 million of gains, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within these year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 results was the recognition of $30.2 million and $14.0 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $188.8 million and $251.1 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized gains and losses on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and mortgage loan portfolios.\n____________________\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nIn addition, our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were affected by the unrealized gains and losses of certain other derivative instruments that were accounted for as trading derivative instruments (i.e., credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps, inverse interest-only securities and forward residential mortgage loan purchase commitments).\nThe following table presents the carrying value and coupon of our net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and certain attributes of the underlying collateral as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n\nOverview\n\nThe increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency RMBS AFS for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and non-Agency RMBS and Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was the result of increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties, which are generally based on a specified margin over one-month LIBOR. The cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014. We also did not recognize any interest expense on the financing of trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading securities position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average annualized net yield on our Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. \nEquity\nAs opportunities in the residential and commercial mortgage marketplace change, we continue to evolve our business model. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to continue to increase our allocation towards MSR, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets, and decrease our exposure to RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold a number of Agency RMBS, primarily due to widening spreads and our belief that it is prudent to position ourselves with minimal basis and prepayment risk exposure. Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on legacy\u201d securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with new issue\u201d non-Agency RMBS. We believe these new issue\u201d securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nThe increase in net interest spread on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS combined with a decrease in cost of funds due to our extended maturity profile, as discussed above. However, the decrease in net interest rate spread on non-Agency RMBS was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, which were replaced with securities at lower yields, offset by a decrease in cost of funds on borrowings. In total, the increase in net interest spread on AFS securities and Agency Derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment.\n____________________\nOther (Loss) Income\n____________________\nOn December 19, 2012, we completed the contribution of our portfolio of single-family rental properties to Silver Bay, a newly organized Maryland corporation intended to qualify as a REIT and focused on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family residential properties for rental income and long-term capital appreciation. We contributed our equity interests in the wholly owned subsidiary, Two Harbors Property Investment LLC to Silver Bay, and in exchange for the contribution, received shares of common stock of Silver Bay. Silver Bay completed its IPO of its common stock on December 19, 2012. We distributed shares of Silver Bay common stock we received in the transaction to our stockholders on or about April 24, 2013. Because we will not have any significant continuing involvement in Two Harbors Property Investment LLC, all of the associated operating results were removed from continuing operations and are presented separately as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. No remaining associated operating results were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 Commercial real estate assets; and \nInterest Income Recognition\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately $268.0 million to $737.8 million at December 31, 2015. The cash movements can be summarized by the following:\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded other loss of $5.5 million and $21.8 million, which includes $19.4 million and $52.4 million in losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $12.3 million and $25.9 million in gains on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts, respectively. Also included in other (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.1 million and $0.5 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\n (1) The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms. \nThe ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB's credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above.\nAccounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represents the most restrictive covenant calculations across the agreements as of December 31, 2015:\n (3) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average cost of funds on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. \nIn 2014, the U.S. Department of Treasury, or the Treasury, requested comment on the development of a responsible private label securities market. We believe that private capital, through the private label securities market, is a critical component to the long-term stability of the mortgage market and, accordingly, submitted a comment letter in response to the request. The Treasury echoes our sentiment and views a diverse housing finance system with numerous capital streams as critical to promoting competition, market efficiency, and consumer choice.\nCommercial real estate loans held-for-investment are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. Because our commercial real estate loans are collateralized either by real property or by equity interests in the commercial real estate borrower, impairment is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral to the amortized cost of the respective loan. The valuation of the underlying collateral requires significant judgment, which includes assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, credit worthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, overall economic conditions, the broader commercial real estate market, local geographic sub-markets, and other factors deemed necessary. If a loan is determined to be impaired, we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan through a charge to provision for loan losses. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from these estimates.\n\n (1) Per share amounts represent cash dividends only and exclude the distribution of Silver Bay common stock declared on March 18, 2013 and distributed on or about April 24, 2013 to our common stockholders of record as of April 2, 2013 amounting to $1.01 per share, as measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\n (3) Allocation of unfunded commitments on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date or the loan maturity date. \nThe increase in net interest rate spread on Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties. The decrease in net interest spread on our trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was generally the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014. We did not recognize any interest income or expense on trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading security position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties, 21 of which had outstanding balances at December 31, 2015, including one facility that provides short-term financing for our residential mortgage loan collateral with outstanding balances at December 31, 2015. In addition, we held long-term secured advances from the FHLB. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio of 3.0 times. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only was 2.5:1.0. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.\nOne of our wholly owned subsidiaries has approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans. We do not directly service mortgage loans, and instead contract with fully licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions for the loans underlying our MSR. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our MSR had a fair market value of $493.7 million and $452.0 million, respectively.\n\nOur borrowings consist primarily of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by our pledge of AFS and trading securities, derivative instruments, residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS AFS are currently pledged as collateral, and the majority of our non-Agency RMBS have been pledged, either through repurchase agreements or FHLB advances. As of December 31, 2015, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only was 2.5:1.0. We believe our debt-to-equity ratio provides unused borrowing capacity and, thus, improves our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet.\nWe purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying residential mortgage loans held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets, are classified as residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts had a carrying value of $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nThe following tables present the components of net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n(Loss) Gain on Servicing Asset\n (1) Average balance represents average total repurchase agreements and FHLB advances on AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets, and average collateralized borrowings for residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nDividends\n\n\nWe monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to a single counterparty.\n\nU.S. GAAP to Taxable Income\n \u2022 Cash flows from investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, investing activities increased our cash balances by approximately $8.0 billion, primarily driven by sales of AFS and trading securities. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nWe have an established accounts payable function and direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our share repurchase program allowed for the repurchase of up to 25,000,000 shares of our common stock. (Subsequent to year end, our board of directors increased this authorization by 50,000,000 shares, or up to 75,000,000 shares under the program). Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 16,115,000 shares had been repurchased under the program for an aggregate cost of $139.1 million; of these, 13,664,300 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $115.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining 2,450,700 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2013 for a total cost of $23.9 million.\n (3) Average credit enhancement remaining on our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, which is the average amount of protection available to absorb future credit losses due to defaults on the underlying collateral. \nCommercial Real Estate Assets\nOn March 18, 2013, we declared a special dividend pursuant to which we distributed 17,824,647 shares of Silver Bay common stock, on a pro rata basis, to our stockholders of record as of April 2, 2013. The dividend was distributed on or about April 24, 2013. As a result, we recognized $13.7 million of realized gains on the distribution as well as $5.9 million of change in unrealized losses within gain (loss) on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Also included in gain (loss) on investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million in dividend income from Silver Bay's $0.01 per share dividend declared on March 21, 2013.\nWe intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under, and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we failed to maintain our exempt status under the 1940 Act and became regulated as an investment company, our ability to, among other things, use leverage would be substantially reduced and, as a result, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in Item 1 - Business - Other Business - Regulation of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, we monitor our compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Tests of the 1940 Act in order to maintain our exempt status. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that we maintained compliance with both the 55% Test and the 80% Test requirements.\n____________________\nWe believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation decisions factor in the opportunities in the marketplace, cost of financing and cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management's opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation among the target assets in each of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding period ends:\nNet Interest Income\n(Loss) Gain on Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables provide discount information on our non-Agency RMBS portfolio:\nThe following tables present the components of interest income and net asset yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of AAA,\u201d or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. Government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.\nServicing Expenses\nInterest Expense and the Cost of Funds\n\nThe following table presents the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe increase in net interest rate spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The increase in net interest spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily the result of an increase in the outstanding balance of FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations.\nThe tables below summarize certain characteristics of our Agency RMBS AFS securities at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nGeneral\nThe key macroeconomic factors that impact our business are home prices and the employment and interest rate environments. Home prices increased modestly throughout 2015, and are expected to gradually appreciate over the next several years. Credit standards remain tight, despite a modest easing in recent months, and have limited borrowers' ability to refinance their mortgages notwithstanding low interest rates and government programs that promote refinancing. Employment market conditions remain relatively solid as jobless claims, unemployment and payroll data are showing stable trends, although underemployment levels remain stubbornly high and new job creation has been disappointing. Other than LTV ratios and cash reserves, we believe employment is the most powerful determinant of homeowners' ongoing likelihood to pay their mortgages. Home price performance and employment are particularly important to our non-Agency portfolio.\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\n (3) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our average cost of funds on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 0.5% for both respective periods, compared to 0.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \n\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n (2) Exposure to European- and Asian-domiciled banks and their U.S. subsidiaries. \nIn 2013, we acquired a portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We subsequently sold substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had CSL with a carrying value of $11.0 million and $35.6 million remaining.\n\n (1) Average purchase price utilized carrying value for weighting purposes. If current face were utilized for weighting purposes, the average purchase price for senior, mezzanine, and total non-Agency RMBS, excluding our non-Agency interest-only portfolio, would be $48.92, $75.63, and $55.80, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and $52.11, $65.59, and $54.78, respectively at December 31, 2014. \n\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n____________________\nWithin our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. Additionally, as an owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. We held a small portfolio of these Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans as of December 31, 2015, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD. We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, nor the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements negatively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations. Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments and MSR, however, negatively affected our financial results.\nAlso included in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation gains of $156.2 million and $101.2 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized changes in unrealized valuation losses of $116.7 million and gains of $198.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe underlying mortgage loans collateralizing our non-Agency RMBS are located across the U.S. The following table presents the five largest geographic concentrations of the mortgages collateralizing these RMBS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and counterparty geographical concentration at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a REIT, as defined under the Code.\n\nRegulatory and legislative actions taken in the past few years in an effort to improve economic conditions and increase liquidity in the financial markets, as well as other actions related to the fall-out from the financial and foreclosure crises, continue to impact the market. Regulatory actions that could affect the value and availability of our target assets, either positively or negatively, include: attempts by the U.S. government to further simplify the refinancing process to allow more borrowers to refinance into lower interest rate mortgage loans; the streamlined loan modification initiative for borrowers that are 90+ days delinquent implemented by the GSEs; the real estate owned, or REO, -to-rental program supported by the GSEs; the extension of both the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program 2.0, or HARP 2.0, through 2016; the strict ability-to-repay\u201d and qualified mortgage\u201d regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB; the enforcement of and potential liability associated with TRID; and the application of the risk retention requirements of Section 15G of the Exchange Act.\n____________________\n\nAgency RMBS\nCredit losses\n(Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n____________________\nWithin our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business, we acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions with the intent to securitize the loans through the issuance of non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. Our intention is to retain the related subordinated securities, representing the credit risk piece associated with these deals. We also hold a small legacy portfolio of CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater (i.e., the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default on CSL than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans or provide direct financing to lenders; rather, through our mortgage loan conduit we contract with originators to acquire loans they originate that meet our purchase criteria.\nInterest Income and Average Portfolio Yield\nThe following table provides the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions:\nClassification and Valuation of Collateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts\nThe following table provides details of our changes in stockholders' equity from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015:\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $5.2 million and $17.5 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was the recognition of $7.6 million and $30.2 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $177.8 million and $188.8 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and loan portfolios.\n \u2022 Cash flows from financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, financing activities decreased our cash balance by approximately $6.3 billion, primarily driven by repayment of repurchase agreements due to sales of AFS and trading securities. \nWe are party to a management agreement with PRCM Advisers, pursuant to which PRCM Advisers is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses from us. We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by PRCM Advisers to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by PRCM Advisers as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us, and (ii) any amounts for personnel of PRCM Advisers' affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.\n (1) Core Earnings is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding realized gains and losses\u201d (impairment losses, realized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio, amortization of business combination intangible assets, reserve expense for representation and warranty obligations on MSR and certain upfront costs related to securitization transactions) and unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses\u201d (unrealized gains and losses on the aggregate portfolio). As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Core Earnings is provided for purposes of comparability to other peer issuers. \nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts, compared to $1.3 million and $4.6 million for the same periods in 2014. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other income of $18.5 million, which includes $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded other income of $14.6 million, which includes $22.9 million in losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $37.1 million in gains on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.4 million. The increase in other income (decrease in other loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due in part to falling interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2014.\n (1) Average annualized yield incorporates future prepayment, credit loss and other assumptions, all of which are estimates and subject to change. \nThe net interest rate spread on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represents interest income, net of interest expense, on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, is not indicative of future spreads.\nInterest Income and Average Portfolio Yield\n\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nServicing Expenses\n \u2022 Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as Agency Derivatives\u201d for purposes of U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; \nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nClassification and Valuation of Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities\nRepurchase Agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances\nOur financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes, except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We estimate, based on existence of sufficient evidence, the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our TRSs recognize. Any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made. We plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT. As a result of our expected REIT qualification, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level taxes. However, many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are also party to contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with brokers, underwriters and counterparties to repurchase agreements and investors in the RMBS we issue and the loans underlying our MSR assets. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held $737.8 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $13.2 billion of AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets, MSR and derivative assets; and $10.8 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 4.1:1.0 to 3.0:1.0. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives only also decreased from 3.3:1.0 to 2.5:1.0 due to the repayment of repurchase agreements as a result of sales of AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale\n (2) Cost of financing includes swap interest rate spread. \n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of December 31, 2015, TH Insurance had $3.8 billion in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of 0.6%, and had an additional $215.0 million of available uncommitted capacity for borrowings. To the extent TH Insurance has uncommitted capacity, it may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the FHLB.\nWe purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying debt held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets, is classified as collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts had a carrying value of $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% for both periods. The stated maturity dates for all collateralized borrowings are greater than five years from December 31, 2015.\n (1) Average balance represents average total repurchase agreements and FHLB advances on AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and average collateralized borrowings for residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nThe following tables present the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nFinancial Condition\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our average yield on our Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. \nThe following tables present the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by investment type on our AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nOur Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by our stockholders on May 14, 2015. The Plan provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel, including PRCM Advisers and its affiliates. The Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The Plan provides for grants of common stock, restricted common stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards, subject to a ceiling of 13,000,000 shares. In addition, with respect to awards intended to qualify for relief from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares that may underlie awards over any three-year period to any eligible person may not exceed 1,500,000 as options and 600,000 as other grants. Section 162(m) generally disallows a federal income tax deduction for any publicly held corporation with respect to compensation exceeding $1 million (on a per employee basis) paid in any year to the corporation's chief executive officer or to any of the corporation's three other most highly compensated executive officers, other than its chief financial officer. Because we do not have any employees, management does not believe that Section 162(m) is applicable to us and, therefore, does not currently consider and has not previously considered the effects of Section 162(m) with respect to the granting of awards under the Plan. As such, restricted stock awards granted to certain individuals, as previously disclosed in our proxy statements and other filings with the SEC, have exceeded 600,000 shares over a three year period, as permitted under the Plan. See Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan for further details regarding the Plan.\nA subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.\n____________________\nSecuritization Deal Costs\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. An entity is allowed to measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying collateralized financing entity, or CFE, it consolidates using the fair value of either the CFE's financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. As the Company's securitization trusts are considered qualifying CFEs, the Company determines the fair value of these residential mortgage loans based on the fair value of its collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and its retained interests from the Company's on-balance sheet securitizations (eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP), as the fair value of these instruments is more observable.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n____________________\nThe following table summarizes dividends declared for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and their related tax characterization (per share amounts):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $4.6 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $2.1 million in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of a securitization trust, and $2.0 million in upfront costs related to the subordinated debt and excess servicing rights acquired from a securitization trust issued by a third party, which was paid upon settlement of the acquisitions. These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries during the respective periods.\n\n\nManagement Fees\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing providers. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other RMBS instruments, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency RMBS. We also typically receive two vendor quotes for the residential mortgage loans and MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool-specific characteristics (i.e., loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For residential mortgage loans and MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, address, LTV ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields, securitization economics and trading levels. Additionally for MSR, pricing providers will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nNon-Agency RMBS\nTotal interest expense increased from $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to increased interest expense on collateralized borrowings due to the completion of three securitization transactions in 2014, offset by a decrease in the outstanding balance under repurchase agreements and increase in the outstanding balance under FHLB advances, which provide lower financing rates.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we recognized $91.8 million and $58.5 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $23.3 billion and $17.0 billion notional, respectively, to hedge a portion of our interest rate risk on our short-term repurchase agreements, funding costs, and macro-financing risk and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 68 and 155 notional interest rate swap and swaption positions of $37.4 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $19.6 million and $34.5 million, in 2014 and 2013 respectively, in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $55.4 million in realized losses and $12.3 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions in 2014 and 2013, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\nWe incurred management fees of $48.8 million and $41.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, which are payable to PRCM Advisers under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. However, these fees were reduced by $4.3 million, on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the contribution transaction entered into with Silver Bay. See further discussion of the management fee calculation as well as this adjustment in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur RMBS investments consist primarily of Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS that we classify as available-for-sale, or AFS. All assets classified as AFS, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity, on an after-tax basis. On July 1, 2015, we elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after such date. All Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after July 1, 2015 are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\n (2) FICO represents a mortgage industry accepted credit score of a borrower, which was developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. \n____________________\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of $73.7 million and a provision from income taxes of $84.4 million, respectively. The benefit in 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs, and the provision in 2013 was primarily due to income generated from derivative instruments held in our TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nOther Operating Expenses\n\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nThere have also been a number of legislative proposals aimed at eventually winding down or phasing out the GSEs. It continues to remain uncertain if any proposal will ultimately become legislation, as recently these efforts appear to have little momentum in Congress. We will continue to monitor these and other regulatory and policy activities closely.\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and net asset yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe interest rate environment remained volatile in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the Federal Reserve announced a rate hike in December for the first time in eight years. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term, however, as the Federal Reserve has suggested it will take a measured and conservative approach to further interest rate decisions. Additionally, it appears the Federal Reserve will continue to reinvest its mortgage-backed security principal repayments for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and Agency Derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nAs of December 31, 2015, our stockholders' equity was $3.6 billion and our book value per share was $10.11. As of December 31, 2014, our stockholders' equity was $4.1 billion and our book value per share was $11.10.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nThe majority of our non-Agency RMBS were rated at December 31, 2015. Note that credit ratings are based on the par value of the non-Agency RMBS, whereas the distressed non-Agency RMBS assets in our portfolio were acquired at a heavily discounted price. The following table summarizes the credit ratings of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, based on the Bloomberg Index Rating, a composite of each of the four major credit rating agencies (i.e., DBRS Ltd., Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poor's Corporation and Fitch, Inc.), as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n (4) Three-month CPR is reflective of the prepayment speed on the underlying securitization; however, it does not necessarily indicate the proceeds received on our investment tranche. Proceeds received for each security are dependent on the position of the individual security within the structure of each deal. \n\nThe increase in net interest spread on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. The increase in net interest spread on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by lower financing rates, as discussed above. The decrease in net interest spread on our mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of the securitization transactions completed in the latter half of 2014.\nWe utilize bid side\u201d pricing for our RMBS assets and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer\u201d spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOur interest income on our non-Agency RMBS rated below AA, including unrated securities, is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows. Cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method. We review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on, or the carrying value of, such securities.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both brokers and independent pricing providers by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge broker quotes and valuations from third-party pricing providers to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of residential mortgage loans and MSR based upon the average of prices received from independent providers, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our TRSs recognized a provision for income taxes of $8.8 million and a benefit from income taxes of $16.5 million, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $11.7 million and $73.7 million for the same periods in 2014. The provision recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to realized gains on sales of AFS securities held in our TRSs. Conversely, the benefit recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to losses incurred on derivative instruments held in our TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nThe credit support built into non-Agency RMBS deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection from potential credit losses for more senior tranches. We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency RMBS provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency RMBS on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.\n____________________\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $5.0 billion of repurchase agreements, and the term to maturity ranged from three days to over 6 months. Repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of 1.10% and weighted average remaining maturities of 35 days as of December 31, 2015.\n (1) Interest expense on borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, are calculated based on rates at December 31, 2015. \nNet Economic Interests in Consolidated Securitization Trusts\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 28 and 97 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $12.7 billion and $60.1 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $8.7 million and $41.0 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $101.1 million and $226.2 million in realized losses on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, including early termination penalties. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on 21 and 68 interest rate swap and swaption positions of $11.0 billion and $37.4 billion notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid $14.1 million and $19.6 million in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized $3.7 million and $55.4 million in realized gains on the swaps and swaptions for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.\n (1) Net interest rate spread does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our total average net interest rate spread on the assets shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, compared to 2.2% and 2.5% for the same periods in 2014. \n (2) These yields have not been adjusted for cost of delay and cost to carry purchase premiums. \nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $40.9 million of unpledged Agency RMBS AFS and Agency Derivatives and $48.9 million of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately $71.7 million. We also had approximately $18.9 million of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, $11.0 million of unpledged CSL and $36.1 million of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we we had approximately $43.9 million of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans, $255.9 million of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately $170.7 million. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization.\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) or taxable income but are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders' equity, we expect our net income (loss) to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted as trading instruments. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive (loss) income were $213.9 million and for the three months ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $79.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $42.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net unrealized losses on AFS securities were $496.7 million and for the year ended December 31, 2014, net unrealized gains were $411.1 million, which resulted in comprehensive loss of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to comprehensive income of $578.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe originate and purchase commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments. These assets are classified as commercial real estate assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we are the sole certificate holder of a trust entity that holds a commercial real estate loan. The underlying loan held by the trust is consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets and classified as commercial real estate assets. See Note 3 - Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the trust. Commercial real estate assets are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the assets are deemed impaired. As of December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate assets were comprised of eighteen first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of $661.0 million. We did not have any commercial real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.\n\nFrom time to time, we hold U.S. Treasuries in a TRS and classify these securities as trading instruments due to short-term investment objectives. We did not have any U.S. Treasuries on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we held U.S. Treasuries with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion and a fair value of $2.0 billion, classified as trading securities. The unrealized gains included within trading securities were $1.4 million as of December 31, 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded other loss of $1.4 million and other income of $18.5 million, which includes $9.4 million and $41.1 million in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and $11.5 million and $24.3 million in losses on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other (loss) income for the both three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was other mortgage loan revenue of $0.2 million and $0.8 million and dividend income on our FHLB stock of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The increase in other loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $12.6 million and $85.6 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $14.1 billion and $16.1 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $32.2 million and $91.8 million, respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average $22.0 billion and $23.3 billion notional for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate.\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe believe our blended Agency and non-Agency RMBS portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility. As such, we have diversified into several target assets that capitalize on our prepayment and credit expertise.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, trading securities experienced unrealized losses of $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in change in unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to the realization of gains on trading securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:\nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our RMBS and commercial real estate assets, we have three facilities that provide short-term financing for our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and other commercial real estate assets. An overview of the facilities is presented in the tables below:\n\n(Loss) Gain on Servicing Asset\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and that we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. In addition, we have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from our external manager's analytical and portfolio management expertise and infrastructure. We believe that our significant focus on the mortgage market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers.\n____________________\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.4 million of OTTI losses, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in OTTI during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally driven by appreciation in the non-Agency market from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we sold AFS securities for $3.3 billion and $7.0 billion with an amortized cost of $3.2 billion and $6.6 billion, for net realized gains of $109.5 million and $369.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $2.0 billion with an amortized cost of $2.0 billion, resulting in net realized gains of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not hold or sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2015. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we sold AFS securities for $303.1 million and $3.5 billion with an amortized cost of $278.6 million and $3.4 billion, for net realized gains of $24.5 million and $84.4 million, respectively. We also sold U.S. Treasuries for $1.1 billion with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion, for a net realized gain of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We did not sell any U.S. Treasuries during the three months ended December 31, 2014. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that our management believes have higher risk-adjusted returns.\n (1) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n (1) As of December 31, 2015, 120 to 364 days includes the amounts outstanding under the uncommitted mortgage loan warehouse facilities. \n____________________\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our RMBS assets through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and through short- and long-term advances from the FHLB. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency RMBS, with less liquidity and exposure to credit risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. We may also finance our U.S. Treasuries, which we hold from time to time for trading purposes, and our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets is the most meaningful leverage measure as U.S. Treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature and collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the sustainability and price of our financing, diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 3.0 to 5.0 times to finance our RMBS portfolio, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the make-up of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from common stock offerings we conduct. See the section titled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion.\nWe account for our MSR at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income, rather than at amortized cost. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the valuation includes unobservable market data inputs (prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and discount rates).\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the average annualized net yield on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to 3.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $56.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, of other operating expenses, which represents an expense ratio of 1.4% and 1.0% of average equity for the respective periods. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the personnel, infrastructure and volume-based transaction costs to support our mortgage loan and MSR activities.\n\nOur interest income on our Agency and non-Agency RMBS is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method, as adjusted for actual prepayments. We estimate prepayments for our Agency interest-only securities, which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific Agency and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMO, securities. As a result, if prepayments increase (or are expected to increase), we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums. Conversely, if prepayments decrease (or are expected to decrease), we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums.\nThe following analysis focuses on financial results during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $8.3 million and $28.1 million, respectively, in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSR, compared to $1.3 million and $25.9 million for the same periods in 2014. Included in servicing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to a decrease in the MSR representation and warranty reserve of $5.1 million and MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of $1.8 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in servicing expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by the reduction in the MSR representation and warranty reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n (4) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThe following analysis focuses on financial results during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n\n\nWe evaluate credit risk on our residential mortgage loans through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis and through on-going asset surveillance.\nThe size of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio has decreased by $1.2 billion since December 31, 2014 as we sold a number of securities, many of which were considered subprime. Our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased from 73.0% at December 31, 2014 to 67.7% at December 31, 2015. As a result, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount and total face value has also decreased (as disclosed in Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). When focused on principal and interest securities, from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount decreased from 57.3% to 45.9%, and our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total face value decreased from 23.1% to 16.9%. As our allocation of non-Agency RMBS to subprime securities has decreased over the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, we believe these comparable portfolio metrics are reflective of our investment profile, regardless of portfolio size.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\n\n____________________\nOur residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net income. Fair value is generally determined based on current secondary market pricing or cash flow models using market-based yield requirements.\n\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and average annualized net asset yield earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and Agency Derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\nThe increase in net yields on Agency RMBS AFS for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments on premium-priced RMBS and interest-only Agency RMBS. However, the decrease in net yields on non-Agency RMBS was due to the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with securities at lower yields.\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements\nYields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment were relatively consistent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as rates on prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans were generally flat over the course of the past two years. The yields on commercial real estate assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 represent interest income on assets purchased during 2015, many of which were settled in the latter half of 2015, which, as a result, are not indicative of future yields.\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that are pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances.\nThe following tables present our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio by loan type as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nAs our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing shift. As previously discussed, our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (e.g., uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events).\n____________________\nGain (Loss) on Investment Securities\nInflation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, loss on servicing asset of $128.4 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $54.8 million and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $73.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gain on servicing asset of $13.9 million includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of $6.8 million and an increase in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of $20.7 million. The increase in (loss) gain on servicing asset for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the significant growth in the size of the MSR portfolio outstanding during the respective periods combined with changes in interest rates and prepayment assumptions.\nTrading Securities, at Fair Value\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $128.2 million, which includes servicing fee income of $125.1 million, ancillary fee income of $2.2 million and float income of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized total servicing income of $12.0 million, which includes servicing fee income of $11.8 million and ancillary fee income of $0.2 million. The increase in servicing income for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was the result of the significant growth of our MSR portfolio at the end of 2013.\n\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded losses of $4.0 million and gains of $14.3 million on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of losses of $3.7 million and gains of $16.0 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and losses of $0.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.\nWe review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, we did not recognize any OTTI losses, but for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $0.5 million in OTTI losses. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.2 million and $0.4 million in OTTI losses, respectively. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for other-than-temporary impairments, refer to Note 5 - Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our MSR portfolio included MSR on 245,144 and 224,073 loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $51.4 billion and $44.9 billion, respectively. The following tables summarize certain characteristics of the loans underlying our MSR at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe are externally managed by PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River, a global multi-strategy asset management firm providing comprehensive portfolio management, transparency and liquidity to institutional and high net worth investors.\n\n (2) Contractual obligation for the management fee is estimated through the contract expiration date of October 28, 2016, inclusive of the termination fee as defined in the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers. Disclosure assumes agreement not renewed or terminated without cause. \n\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets.\n\nThe recently enacted Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 contains changes to certain aspects of the U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs. In particular, the act will reduce the maximum allowable value of assets attributable to our TRSs from 25% to 20%, which change will be applicable with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We currently monitor our compliance with this TRS asset test and, in light of this change, we intend to continue to meet the requirement.\n\nWe incurred management fees of $12.3 million and $50.3 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and $12.2 million and $48.8 million for the same periods in 2014, which are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders' equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. See further discussion of the management fee calculation in Note 25 - Related Party Transactions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe calculate that at least 75% of our assets were qualified REIT assets, as defined in the Code for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the 75% source of income test and for the 95% source of income test rules for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consequently, we met the REIT income and asset tests. We also met all REIT requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that we qualified as a REIT under the Code.\nOur non-Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine tranches of mortgage-backed securities, and excludes the retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, as they are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables provide investment information on our non-Agency RMBS as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nThe following table summarizes the number of months until the next reset for our floating or adjustable rate Agency RMBS AFS portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and may be financed with credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $9.7 million and $12.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, trading securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of $1.4 million, compared to a change in unrealized gains of $4.2 million and losses of $2.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, respectively. We did not hold any trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in change in unrealized losses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was driven by the sale of our U.S. Treasuries and corresponding recognition of realized gains during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDerivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We rely on internal models corroborated by quotations from a third party to determine these fair values. If our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results, our reported GAAP net income (loss) may be adversely affected.\nWe expect that a material percentage of our assets will remain in whole-pool Agency RMBS in light of the long-term attractiveness of the asset class and in order to continue to satisfy the requirements of our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Interest-only Agency securities and MSR also provide a complementary investment and risk-management strategy to our principal and interest Agency RMBS investments. Risk-adjusted returns in our Agency RMBS portfolio may decline if we are required to pay higher purchase premiums due to lower interest rates or additional liquidity in the market. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's prior quantitative easing programs and continued reinvestment of its mortgage-backed security principal repayments and other policy changes may impact the returns of our Agency RMBS portfolio.\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. The fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic, or trading, hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument.\n____________________\nTo the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate assets and other target assets, and for other general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Maintaining best in class\u201d investment, corporate governance, investor relations and disclosure practices. We attribute our growth to portfolio alpha generation, innovation and best practice in corporate governance and disclosure. \nFair Value Measurement\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, trading securities, mortgage loans, MSR and collateralized borrowings may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs that are current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency.\n (2) Includes loans issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or private investors. \n\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported earnings (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss), is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our unrealized fair value gains on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, positively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on certain U.S. Treasuries classified as trading instruments due to their short-term investment objectives, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, net economic interests in securitizations and MSR.\nIn January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance's outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA's ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.\nAlso included in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation losses of $198.5 million and gains of $291.5 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended December 31, 2014. Since these swaps and swaptions are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded directly to stockholders' equity through other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, or to gain on investment securities, in the case of Agency interest-only securities.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n \u2022 MSR; \nThe following table summarizes the carrying values and credit ratings of our net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts, based on a composite of credit ratings received from DBRS Ltd., Standard & Poor's Corporation and/or Fitch, Inc. upon issuance of the securities, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans and to own and manage MSR.\nSubstantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\nOur collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election, with changes in fair value recorded in GAAP net (loss) income. Fair value is generally determined based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $3.8 billion of FHLB advances. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average term to maturity of our FHLB advances was 154 months, ranging from approximately 12 months to 20 years. The weighted average cost of funds for our advances was 0.58% at December 31, 2015.\n\nFrom time to time, we also hold U.S. Treasuries for trading purposes. Our trading securities are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain (loss) on investment securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If our RMBS AFS were also classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our GAAP net income (loss).\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $764.3 million and $500.2 million, respectively, and had outstanding commitments to purchase $286.1 million and $554.8 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively, subject to fallout if the loans do not close. Our intention is to securitize these loans and/or exit through a whole loan sale.\n (1) Average balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities, trading securities, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives and average unpaid principal balance, adjusted for purchase price changes, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nInterest Expense and the Cost of Funds\nYields on AFS securities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 were consistent with those for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net yields on AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was predominantly driven by the sale of securities previously purchased at higher yields that we believe had reached maximum value. The increase in net yields on Agency Derivatives for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was predominantly driven by slower prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment. The increase in yields on trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of increases in Treasury rates. We did not recognize any interest income on trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as we sold our trading security position during the three months ended June 30, 2015.\n (1) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives and excludes repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. \n____________________\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $11.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of $8.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and gains of $2.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gains (losses) recorded on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, was due in part to interest rates generally rising during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to interest rates generally falling during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\n (4) Net of interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nOur 2015 efforts focused on three strategic objectives that we believe will position us for long-term success.\nAdditionally, as the owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to HUD. As of December 31, 2015, we held Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $36.1 million, which, in the majority of instances, will undergo successful loan modifications, return to performing loans and be redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools or be immediately conveyed to HUD.\n (2) Includes repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries with an open maturity period (i.e., rolling 1-day maturity) renewable at the discretion of either party to the agreements. \n \u2022 Liquidity must be greater than the sum of 1.5% of indebtedness related to Agency securities and 5.0% of total indebtedness, excluding indebtedness related to Agency securities. As of December 31, 2015, our liquidity, as defined, was $1.1 billion. \nThe following tables present the components of our comprehensive (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2013:\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total servicing income of $32.8 million and $127.4 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $31.9 million and $123.8 million, ancillary fee income of $0.5 million and $2.1 million, and float income of $0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total servicing income of $31.6 million and $128.2 million, respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of $30.7 million and $125.1 million, and ancillary fee income of $0.6 million and $2.2 million, and float income of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Servicing income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with that for the same periods in 2014 due to similar average MSR portfolio sizes during the respective periods.\nOur Agency RMBS and MSR portfolios are subject to inherent prepayment risk. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR to deteriorate, and our fixed coupon Agency pools to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. As previously discussed, despite the Federal Reserve raising rates in December, the low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our security selection process, positions us to ideally respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment.\nOur net interest income includes income from our RMBS portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and income from our residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs, and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency RMBS and in our mortgage loan and commercial real estate portfolios.\nNet Interest Income\n\nThe decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency and non-Agency RMBS AFS, Agency Derivatives and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of a decrease in the outstanding balance under repurchase agreements and increase in the outstanding balance under FHLB advances, resulting in our ability to extend our maturity profile without an increase in financing rates. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of trading securities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of counterparties granting a negative borrowing rate on repurchase agreements financing our U.S. Treasuries in 2014. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was generally the result of the securitization transactions completed in the latter half of 2014.\n (4) Net of interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThe permanent tax differences recorded in 2014 and 2015 include a recurring difference in the income recognized from the securitization trusts that are consolidated for U.S. GAAP purposes only. The permanent tax differences also include a recurring difference in compensation expense related to restricted stock dividends. Temporary differences are principally timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments and accretion and amortization from RMBS.\n____________________\nEquity Incentive Plan\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2015, our net yield realized on the portfolio was higher than previous periods. Yields and net interest spreads on Agency RMBS and MSR are generally higher than recent quarters, while yields and spreads on non-Agency RMBS has generally decreased. Net yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in securitizations have been relatively consistent. Additionally, our cost of financing has decreased as a result of lower swap spread. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our target assets, including Agency and non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment, net of collateralized borrowings, in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and MSR for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the four immediately preceding quarters:\nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $15.5 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our executive officers, including our principal financial officer and general counsel of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel of $6.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\n (1) Average balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities, trading securities and Agency Derivatives and average unpaid principal balance, adjusted for purchase price changes, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment in securitization trusts. \nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n___________________\n\n (4) Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value\nWe have not participated in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities. However, as of December 31, 2015, we had unfunded commitments on commercial real estate loans held-for-investment of $52.2 million to be used for future fundings to borrowers, generally to finance lease-related or capital expenditures.\nIncluded in our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $2.1 million and $5.0 million of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we held for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within the results for three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the recognition of $6.6 million and $27.8 million of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of $142.2 million and $149.6 million, respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments.\n (1) Includes loans issued by Ginnie Mae. \nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, repurchase agreements and FHLB advances had the following characteristics:\nAlthough we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in 2016 and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\n \u2022 Executing business diversification opportunities across residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets. We continue to pursue a variety of opportunities that leverage our core competencies of credit and prepayment risk management. We acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions and have established a nonconforming loan securitization program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we meaningfully increased the number of sellers in our network and completed seven securitizations. Within our MSR business, we continue to purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. During 2015, we expanded our flow-sale arrangements within our originator partner network. In addition, we originate and acquire senior and mezzanine commercial real estate assets. These assets are U.S. domiciled and are secured by a diverse mix of property types including office, retail, multifamily and hotel properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans. We are taking a measured approach as we diversify, keeping true to our strategic long-term plans and our core strengths. \nTotal interest income, including interest income on Agency Derivatives, decreased from $163.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $139.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to sales of AFS securities in 2015, offset by purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015. Conversely, total interest income increased from $606.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $628.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015, offset by sales of AFS securities in 2015.\n \u2022 Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.  We generally view our target assets in three strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets with inherent credit risk including non-Agency RMBS, net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans. Our commercial strategy, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, includes as target assets first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, b-notes and preferred equity. As of December 31, 2015, we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans.\nClassification and Valuation of Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (1) Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the average annualized net yield on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to 3.4% for both of the same periods in 2014. \nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe also monitor exposure to counterparties involved in our mortgage loan conduit and MSR businesses. In connection with securitization transactions and MSR assets, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the investors in the RMBS we issue or the loans underlying the MSR we own. If the representations and warranties that we are required to make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of these businesses. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nChange in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n\nClassification and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights\nResults of Operations\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by vintage and prepayment protection:\nThe U.S. economy continues to navigate headwinds that include global economic lethargy, specifically in China; geopolitical unrest across various regions worldwide; the ongoing European debt crisis; quantitative easing by the European Central Bank; and persistently high underemployment.\nOn December 16, 2015, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, bringing our total 2015 cash dividends declared to $1.04 per diluted share. Our book value per diluted common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $10.11 at December 31, 2015, a decrease from $11.10 book value per diluted common share at December 31, 2014. During this twelve month period, we recognized a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $496.7 million and declared cash dividends of $378.3 million, driving the overall decrease in book value.\nFor the 2015 taxable year, we declared dividends totaling $1.04 per share. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain distribution requirements. For the fiscal year ended 2015, our board of directors elected to distribute the majority of our taxable income to avoid U.S. Federal Income taxes. As such, temporary differences between GAAP net income (loss) and taxable income can generate deterioration in book value on a permanent and temporary basis as taxable income is distributed that has not been earned for U.S. GAAP purposes. The following table presents cash dividends declared on our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n (2) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n\n (2) Cost of funds by investment type is based on the underlying investment type of the asset assigned as collateral. Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, compared to 1.7% and 1.5% for the same periods in 2014. \nIncluded in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately $6.8 million and $22.9 million, compared to $4.0 million and $15.5 million of costs for the same periods in 2014. Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel of $0.2 million and $1.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and $0.2 million and $1.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company's activities in accordance with the management agreement. Equity based compensation expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Plan (see discussion in Note 22 - Equity Incentive Plan), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel, of $0.8 million and $4.4 million, compared to $1.6 million and $6.6 million for the same periods in 2014.\n\n (3) Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in (loss) gain on other derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, while interest expense on Agency Derivatives is included in interest expense on repurchase agreements on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. \n (2) Cost of funds by investment type is based on the underlying investment type of the asset assigned as collateral. Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. \n \u2022 Managing a portfolio of RMBS to generate attractive returns with balanced risks. We operate a hybrid REIT model, diversifying our portfolio across Agency and non-Agency RMBS in combination with derivative hedging instruments. We manage to an overall low level of interest rate exposure and leverage. We believe effectively managing an appropriate balance of risks within our portfolio is critical to providing an attractive return to our stockholders and our ability to adjust our allocations and deploy capital across sectors allow us to optimize portfolio results over time.
