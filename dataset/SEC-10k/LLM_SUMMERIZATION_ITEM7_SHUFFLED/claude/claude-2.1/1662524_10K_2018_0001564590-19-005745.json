Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and our financial condition at December 31, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under Item 1A of Part I of this report, \"Risk Factors.\" In addition, the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements as indexed on page.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. The hallmark of FCS is extremely elevated triglycerides. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients with FCS worldwide. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our pipeline drugs, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform.\nWe are continuing to build our current commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved, as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. Our supply chain is fully operational in both the U.S. and E.U. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass\u2122 in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis. This program is intended to empower people with accurate genetic information, so they can make informed decisions about their healthcare.\nIn 2018, we obtained TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, the ligand conjugated antisense, or LICA, drug in development for TTR, under an exclusive license from Ionis. With the licensing agreement, we have expanded our efforts to treat people with serious and under-served rare diseases focusing on transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, and cardiometabolic diseases.\nATTR\nTEGSEDI is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the TTR protein. In patients with hATTR amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal genetic disease, both the hereditary and wild-type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient's life and eventually leads to death.\nWe estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy.\nTEGSEDI was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and was licensed by us in April 2018. In addition to TEGSEDI, we and Ionis are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx for hereditary and wild-type forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. We initiated clinical development of AKCEA-TTR-LRx in 2018.\nCardiometabolic\nOur lipid/cardiometabolic drugs, WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, are all based on antisense technology developed by Ionis. We are focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. On May 10, 2018, the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to support approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of people with FCS. On August 27, 2018, we and Ionis announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for WAYLIVRA. The FDA did not cite any new concerns beyond those described in the advisory committee briefing book, in which the main areas of focus were the dosing schedule and management of thrombocytopenia. We continue to feel strongly that WAYLIVRA demonstrates a favorable benefit/risk profile in people with FCS, as was reflected in the positive outcome from the Advisory Committee meeting. We received a preliminary notification of a Notice of Noncompliance withdrawal letter, or NON-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. We and Ionis are engaged with the FDA and plan to work with Health Canada to confirm a path forward for WAYLIVRA.\nFCS is a severe and rare lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with this disease are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the WAYLIVRA program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. WAYLIVRA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Our other three lipid/cardiometabolic drugs are currently in Phase 2 clinical development.\nCommercial Infrastructure\nWe are continuing to build our global infrastructure as we begin to commercialize TEGSEDI and prepare to commercialize WAYLIVRA in the E.U., and we have commercial teams in place in the U.S., E.U. and Canada. In addition, in August 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities.\nTo maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. As part of our collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will pay Ionis the sublicense fee in Akcea common stock. Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis' exercise of its option to\nexclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which they would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\nFor AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, under our agreement with Novartis, after we complete Phase 2 development and if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we would receive an additional $150.0 million license fee which we would also share equally with Ionis. If exercised, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prior cardiovascular risk. If approved, Novartis would commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions. Similar to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\nOur strategic collaboration with Novartis has a potential aggregate transaction value of over $1.0 billion, plus royalties, which we would generally be required to share equally with Ionis. The calculation of potential aggregate transaction value assumes that Novartis licenses, successfully develops and achieves regulatory approval for both AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the U.S., E.U. and Japan, and that Novartis achieves pre-specified sales targets with respect to both drugs. In addition, to the upfront payment that we have received, for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $675.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $360.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. In addition, for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $240.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $265.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, and Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will pay 50% of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to Ionis as a sublicense fee. See Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe began recognizing revenue under the collaboration with Novartis upon its initiation in 2017. Our collaboration revenue for 2018 was $50.6 million. In addition, we began to recognize TEGSEDI product revenue in 2018 and recognized licensing revenue in the third quarter of 2018 related to our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. Our product revenue and licensing revenue for 2018 was $2.2 million and $12.0 million respectively. Our total revenue for 2018 was $64.9 million. Our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, preparing to commercialize TEGSEDI and potentially WAYLIVRA upon approval, and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. The transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of our products and product candidates and the achievement of a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We incur meaningful expenses to support commercialization, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. Further, we incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million. We have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. In July 2017, we completed our IPO and raised $182.3 million in net proceeds from the IPO including the $50.0 million Novartis concurrent private placement. In April 2018, we completed a licensing transaction with Ionis to commercialize TEGSEDI. In conjunction with this transaction, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million. As a result of the MA approval for TEGSEDI in the EU, on August 3, 2018 we issued 1,597,571 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $40.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI, and as a result of the regulatory approval for TEGSEDI in the United States, on October 17, 2018 we issued 1,671,849 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $50.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI. See Note 7, License Agreements and Services Agreement with Ionis, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our TTR licensing agreement with Ionis. We plan to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 to further our commercialization efforts of TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and continue the advancement of our pipeline drugs.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. However, we expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to commercialize TEGSEDI, or any other approved drug, including WAYLIVRA. We may seek to obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan.\nOur Relationship with Ionis\nIonis formed Akcea as a wholly owned subsidiary to complete development of and commercialize Ionis' drugs to treat lipid disorders. We began business operations in January 2015. We licensed our cardiometabolic franchise from Ionis at the beginning of 2015. Prior to licensing these drugs, Ionis' employees performed all of the development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for these drugs either themselves or through third-party providers. As such, Ionis incurred all of the expenses associated with these activities and reported them in its consolidated financial statements. TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx were licensed from Ionis in April 2018. Prior to then, Ionis had been advancing these drugs in development and incurring the expenses for those activities. Under our license agreements with Ionis, Ionis continued and is continuing to conduct development, regulatory or manufacturing activities for our drugs and to charge us for this work. As of December 31, 2018, Ionis owed approximately 75 percent of our outstanding stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. As such, we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition. In the following paragraphs, we describe our most significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. As described below, there are specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies and we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as one may expect, and that best estimates may require adjustment. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe began to record revenues from product sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the approval of TEGSEDI in the U.S., EU and Canada. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, our revenues were derived from our collaboration agreement with Novartis and collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. The terms of such collaboration agreements may include consideration such as nonrefundable license fees, funding of research and development services, payments due upon the achievement of clinical and pre-clinical performance-based development milestones, regulatory milestones, manufacturing services, sales-based milestones and royalties on product sales.\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard, discussed below under Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. Our adoption of the new revenue standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as discussed below in Note 2. This new revenue standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, then assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. When we offer options for additional goods or services, such as an option to license a drug in the future or for additional goods or services to be provided in the future, we evaluate whether such options are material rights that should be treated as additional performance obligations. We typically have not concluded that the option to license a drug or the options for additional goods or services that may be requested in the future under our collaboration agreement are material rights as the amounts attributable to such options represent standalone selling price, and therefore no consideration is allocated to these items at the inception of an agreement. When a partner exercises its option to\nlicense a drug or requests the additional goods or services, a new performance obligation is created for that item. Once performance obligations are identified, we then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that we allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue based on the use of an output or input method. As of December 31, 2018, we have three revenue streams: our strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or collaboration agreement, with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we entered into in January 2017, our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, which we entered into in August 2018 and commercial product revenue related to sales of TEGESDI in the fourth quarter of 2018. For a complete discussion of the accounting for our revenue streams, see Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, Note 8, Collaboration and License Agreement with PTC Therapeutics, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the full retrospective transition method. Under this method, we revised our consolidated financial statements for prior period amounts including the periods included in this Report on Form 10-K, as if Topic 606 had been effective for such periods. The references as revised\u201d used herein refer to revisions of amounts originally reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as of December 31, 2017 as a result of our adoption of Topic 606.\nImpact of Adoption\nAs a result of adopting Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we revised our comparative financial statements for the prior years as if Topic 606 had been effective for that period. On September 18, 2018, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to present recast consolidated financial statements for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition set forth in Topic 606. The financial information recast in the Form 8-K was originally filed with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018. Under Topic 605, we recognized revenue from our collaboration with Novartis over time on a straight-line basis. Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue from our collaboration with Novartis using the input method based on the total cost of performing services over time. As a result, the following financial statement line items for fiscal year 2017 were affected.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Revised\nUnder Topic 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Originally\nReported\nUnder Topic 605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect\nof Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term portion of deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated deficit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (296,221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (284,413\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Revised\nUnder Topic 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Originally\nReported\nUnder Topic 605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect\nof Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenue under collaborative\nAgreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (120,470\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (108,662\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121,559\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (109,751\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share of preferred stock, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.80\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.25\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share of common stock owned by Ionis, basic\nand diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.08\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.82\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share of common stock owned by others, basic\nand diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.08\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.82\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Revised\nUnder Topic 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Originally\nReported\nUnder Topic 605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect\nof Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (121,559\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (109,751\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in\noperating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenue, Net\nSubsequent to regulatory approval in Europe on July 11, 2018 and FDA approval in the U.S. on October 5, 2018, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we began to sell TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., the product is distributed through an exclusive distribution agreement with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that takes title to the product and represents our sole customer in the U.S. Our U.S. customer distributes TEGSEDI to a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor (collectively referred to as wholesalers\u201d), who then distribute the product to health care providers and patients. In Germany, the product is distributed through a non-exclusive distribution model with a 3PL that takes title to the product and currently represents our sole customer in Germany. Our customer in Germany then distributes TEGSEDI to hospitals and pharmacies in Germany.\nRevenue from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, upon transfer of title to the customer. We record shipping and handling costs within cost of goods sold on our consolidated statement of operations. We classify payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel for services that are distinct and priced at fair value as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Otherwise payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel that do not meet those criteria are classified as a reduction of revenue, as discussed further below. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. We have elected not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Our payment terms are generally between thirty to ninety days. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred since the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, wholesalers, health care providers and other indirect customers relating to the sale of TEGSEDI. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nThe following are the components of variable consideration related to product revenue:\nChargebacks: In the U.S., we estimate obligations resulting from contractual commitments with the government and other entities to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to our U.S. customer. Our U.S. customer charges us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. We record reserves for these chargebacks related to product sold to our U.S. customer during the reporting period, as well as our estimate of product that remains in the distribution channel at the end of the reporting period that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers in future periods.\nGovernment rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under government programs, including Medicaid programs and Medicare in the United States. We estimate Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. On a quarterly basis, we update our estimates and record any adjustments in the period that we identify the adjustments. In Germany, pharmaceutical companies must grant a specified rebate percentage to the German government. We have included this rebate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized.\nTrade discounts and allowances: We provide customary invoice discounts on TEGSEDI sales to our U.S. customer for prompt payment that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive and pay for various distribution services from our U.S. customer and wholesalers in the U.S. distribution channel. For services that are either not distinct from the sale of our product or for which we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value, such fees are classified as a reduction of product revenue.\nProduct Returns: Our U.S. customer has return rights and the wholesalers have limited return rights primarily related to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of revenue and a refund liability in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Based on the distribution model for TEGSEDI, contractual inventory limits with our customer and wholesalers and the price of TEGSEDI, we believe there will be minimal returns. Our customer in Germany only takes title to the product once it receives an order from a hospital or pharmacy and therefore does not maintain any inventory of TEGSEDI. Therefore, there is limited return risk and the Company has not recorded any return estimate in the transaction price for TEGSEDI sold in Germany.\nOther incentives: In the U.S., other incentives include co-payment assistance we provide to patients with commercial insurance that have coverage and reside in states that allow co-payment assistance. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue. The estimate is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded product revenue, net, of $2.2 million, which consist of $1.2 million of TEGSEDI sales in the U.S., and $1.0 million of TEGSEDI sales in Germany. The following table summarizes balances and activity in each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Chargebacks, discounts and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Government and other rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision related to current period sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment related to prior period sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit or payments made during the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory\nPrior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incur expenses for the manufacturing of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense.\nFor inventory related costs incurred subsequent to July 1, 2018, we reflected these amounts as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or market value under the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, basis. We periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of product sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management and if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by our management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2018 a majority of our physical inventory for TEGSEDI was produced prior to when we obtained regulatory approval and accordingly had no cost basis as we recorded the related costs as research and development expense in prior periods. At December 31, 2018 the amount of finished goods recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets related to our approved product TEGSEDI was $85,000.\nIntangible Assets\nWe obtained exclusive licenses from Ionis for specific patents that Ionis owns and maintains related to our drug pipeline. We recorded our licenses from Ionis as a capital contribution using the carryover basis of Ionis' historical cost for the related patents. We are amortizing our capitalized licenses over their estimated useful life, which is the term of the underlying individual patents owned by Ionis.\nIn addition, we maintain definite-lived intangible assets related to regulatory milestone payments made to Ionis that are recoverable through future cash flows from approved products, which are capitalized as license intangible assets. These assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which are generally estimated to be the remaining patent life. If our estimate of the product's useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then the shorter period is used. Intangible assets are amortized using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenue can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when future revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales to the extent the underlying license is commercialized or research and development prior to its commercialization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCost of Product Sales\nAs a result of receiving marketing authorization, or MA, approval for TEGSEDI from the European Commission, or EC, in July 2018, we began recording all TEGSEDI related expenses as cost of product sales starting in July 2018. Cost of product sales consists of manufacturing costs, transportation and freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and distribution of TEGSEDI. Cost of product sales may also include period costs related to certain manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. Additionally, we expensed a significant portion of the cost of producing TEGSEDI that we will use in the commercial launch as research and development expense prior to the regulatory approval of TEGSEDI.\nEstimated Liability for Research and Development Costs\nWe record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which vendors or service providers have not yet billed us. These liabilities are for products or services that we have received and primarily relate to ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies. These costs primarily include third-party clinical management costs, laboratory and analysis costs, toxicology studies and investigator grants. We have drugs in concurrent nonclinical and clinical studies at several sites throughout the world. To ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing nonclinical and clinical research and development costs during the period in which we incur such costs, we maintain an accrual to cover these costs. We update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis. The assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment. Upon settlement, these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual amounts.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. We recognize the value of the portion of the award that we ultimately expect to vest as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations. We reduce stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revise the expense in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe value our stock option awards and stock purchase rights under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected principally by our estimated common stock fair value and requires us to make a number of other assumptions, including: the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The RSUs we have granted vest annually over a four-year period.\nPrior to December 2015, Ionis granted our employees options to purchase shares of Ionis' common stock, or Ionis options. In December 2015, we granted our employees holding Ionis options additional options to purchase shares of our common stock, or Akcea options.\nWe determined the stock-based compensation expense for the Ionis options at the date of grant and recognized compensation expense over the vesting period of the Ionis options. In December 2015, we accounted for the issuance of the Akcea options as a modification to the original grant of the Ionis options because the grant of the Ionis options and Akcea options essentially represented a single stock award as the exercisability provisions of the Ionis options and Akcea options grants were interrelated and mutually exclusive. The total compensation expense measured on the modification date was the sum of the grant date fair value of the Ionis options plus any incremental compensation cost resulting from the grant of the Akcea options.\nIn 2016, we began concurrently granting Ionis options and Akcea options to our employees. Because the exercisability provisions of the awards are interrelated and mutually exclusive as described above, the fair values of the Ionis options and the Akcea options were determined on the date of grant and the option with the greater fair value was recognized over the vesting period of the awards. In 2017, we no longer concurrently granted Ionis and Akcea options. Our board of directors only receive grants under the Akcea option plan.\nFollowing our IPO, we no longer grant Ionis options to our employees. Under the terms of the Ionis options, when we completed our IPO, the Ionis options our employees were holding were terminated. The termination of the Ionis options was determined not to be a modification, as the options were terminated based upon the existing contractual terms of the option agreements. As such, we will continue to recognize expense based on the valuation that was determined upon the grant date for options issued in 2016 or the modification date for options issued in 2015 and 2017.\nThe fair value of stock options granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options granted under the Ionis 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of Ionis' common stock on the date of grant. Options granted to employees vest over a four-year period, with 25 percent exercisable at the end of one year from the date of the grant and the balance vesting ratably, on a monthly basis, thereafter and have a term of ten years. Options granted to directors vest annually over a four-year period and have a term of ten years.\nSee Note 9, Equity and Stock-based Compensation, for additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans.\nIncome Taxes\nPrior to the completion of our IPO we filed our tax returns on a consolidated and combined basis with Ionis for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. For financial statement purposes when we are required to file on a consolidated or combined basis, we calculate our income tax amounts, including net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, using a separate return methodology which determines income taxes as if we were a separate taxpayer from Ionis. Effective July 19, 2017, the date of our IPO, we are no longer included in the consolidated federal income tax return with Ionis. We determined the amount of federal tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that transferred to us upon deconsolidation from Ionis. We are still required to file most of our state tax returns on a consolidated or combined basis with Ionis. Therefore, for financial statement purposes we calculated our state income tax amounts using the separate return method.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation settlement. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves for changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past operating results, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce the balance of our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We have incurred financial statement losses since inception and as a result we have a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the future realization of our net deferred tax assets and will reduce the valuation allowance in any such period in which we determine that all, or a portion, of our deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.\nWe do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently expected to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.\nResults of Operations\nIn order to analyze and compare our results of operations to other similar companies, we believe it is important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards from our expenses. We believe non-cash stock-based compensation expense is not indicative of our operating results or cash flows from our operations. Further, we internally evaluate the performance of our operations excluding it. All numbers presented below exclude stock-based compensation expense unless otherwise indicated.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (as revised)\nRevenue\nThe following table sets forth our revenue for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (as revised)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenue under collaboration agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenue. Product revenue of $2.2 million for 2018 relates to sales of TEGSEDI in the Unites States and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any product revenue.\nLicensing revenue. Licensing revenue of $12.0 million for 2018 relates to the upfront payment received from PTC Therapeutics related to our PTC License Agreement entered into in August 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any licensing revenue.\nResearch and development revenue. In 2018, we recognized $50.6 million compared to $43.4 million in 2017 (as revised), in research and development revenue from our collaboration with Novartis. The increase in research and development revenue is primarily the result of level of efforts related to activities for our AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx programs.\nCost of sales and license expense\nThe following table sets forth our cost of sales and license expense for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales - product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales - intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of license\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales and license expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales and license expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales - product expense of $1.7 million for 2018 consists of period costs and certain fixed costs associated with the manufacturing of TEGSEDI. We do not expect fixed costs will increase in direct correlation to sales. Based on our policy, we expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products as research and development prior to regulatory approval. Certain product costs of TEGSEDI units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 were incurred prior to the July 2018 EU approval, and therefore are not included in cost of sales during the year. We expect cost of sales to increase as we deplete these inventories. The cost of units sold during the period for which there was no cost basis was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. No product cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nCost of sales expense - intangible asset amortization of $2.7 million for 2018 consist of amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the achievement of TEGSEDI regulatory milestones in the U.S. and E.U. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nCost of license of $7.2 million for 2018 consists of TTR sub-license expense due to Ionis related to the payment received as part of the licensing agreement entered into with PTC Therapeutics in August 2018. No license cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nResearch and development expense\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External TEGSEDI expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External WAYLIVRA expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other external research and development projects expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development personnel and overhead expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sublicensing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $120.9 million for the year 2018 compared to $118.3 million for the same period in 2017. The slight increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to development activities related to TEGSEDI, development activities related to our Phase 2b studies for AKCEA APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx which were initiated in the first quarter of 2018 and personnel and overhead expense to support our development efforts. This increase was offset primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash, a decrease in development activities for AKCEA APO(a)-LRx as the clinical study ended, finished data collection and reported topline results, as well as a decrease in development activities for WAYLIVRA. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nThe following table sets forth our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $118.9 million for 2018 compared to $28.1 million for the same period in 2017. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization and commercialization activities necessary to launch TEGSEDI in the U.S., the EU and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the EU. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nOther income and other expense\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2018 totaled $5.7 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. We incurred no interest expense during 2018. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nNet loss for 2018 was $225.8 million compared to $121.6 million for the same period in 2017 (as revised). We incurred a higher net loss during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the development and pre-commercialization and commercial activities for TEGSEDI, the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for WAYLIVRA and our other drugs, and the ongoing global expansion of our company. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80. We had no outstanding preferred shares at December 31, 2018. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.74 and $2.87, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) and 2016\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $43.4 million in research and development revenue (as revised) from our collaboration with Novartis, which we initiated in January 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue.\nResearch and development expense\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External WAYLIVRA expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other external research and development projects expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development personnel and overhead expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sublicensing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $118.3 million for 2017 and increased compared to $63.9 million for 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash. The progression of our other drugs in development, including AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, during 2017 also contributed to the increase in our expenses. In particular we commenced four Phase 2 trials in 2017. This increase in research and development expenses was offset in part by a decrease in external WAYLIVRA expenses primarily related to the completion of the phase 3 program. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nThe following table sets forth our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $28.1 million for 2017 and increased compared to $9.5 million for 2016. Our general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization activities necessary to launch WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the US, Canada and certain EU countries. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nOther income and other expense\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2017 totaled $1.8 million compared to $0.3 million for 2016. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average short-term investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2017 compared to 2016.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. We incurred no interest expense for 2016. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nNet loss for 2017 (as revised) was $121.6 million compared to $83.2 million for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80 compared to $2.88 for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08. We had no outstanding common stock at December 31, 2016. We incurred a higher net loss in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for our drugs, sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, the ongoing global expansion of our company and becoming and operating as a public company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million and accumulated deficit of $522.0 million.\nWe have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. Our borrowings under our line of credit agreement with Ionis converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017. We no longer have access to the line of credit. Additionally, in July 2017 we received $182.3 million in net proceeds from our IPO, including $25.0 million Ionis invested in our IPO and the Novartis concurrent private placement of $50.0 million.\nIn April 2018, the stockholders other than Ionis and its affiliates approved the development, commercialization, collaboration and license agreement, or TTR License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license from Ionis to TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx and a stock purchase agreement, or Ionis SPA, with Ionis, our majority shareholder, which we entered into on March 14, 2018. To support our commercialization of TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital of $186.5 million compared to working capital of $178.4 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital increased in 2018 primarily due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investments as a result of our financing activities. This increase is offset by activities related to our normal course of business. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding payable to Ionis was $18.9 million under our Amended Services Agreement with Ionis\nTEGSEDI is approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada and we are now beginning our commercialization efforts in these three regions. We began to generate product revenue from TEGSEDI drug sales in the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and losses may continue to increase as we develop, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize our other pipeline drugs. We are subject to all of the risks incident in developing and commercializing new drugs and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to expand our commercial efforts for TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, for which we are in on going regulatory discussion in those same jurisdictions. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we may finance our cash needs through additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. In any event, we may not generate significant revenue from product sales prior to the use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. We do not have any committed external source of funds. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of stock or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include increased fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends, selling or licensing intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our drugs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds through stock offerings or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and commercialize our drugs even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize the drugs ourselves.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the design, initiation, progress, size, timing, costs and results of our clinical and nonclinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of drugs that we may pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our need to expand our development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for our drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our strategic collaborators' success in developing and commercializing our drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our need to add infrastructure, implement internal systems and hire additional employees to operate as a public company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the revenue, if any, generated from commercial sales of our drugs for which we receive marketing authorization, which may be affected by market conditions, including obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement of our drugs from third-party payors, including government programs and managed care organizations, and competition within the therapeutic class to which our drugs are assigned.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Lease\nOn April 5, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with MEPT Seaport 13 Stillings LLC, or MEPT, for 30,175 square feet of office space located in Boston, Massachusetts for our new corporate headquarters. The commencement date of the lease was August 2018 and the initial term of the lease is 123 months with one five-year renewal option. We took occupancy of the office space in Boston, Massachusetts in September 2018. MEPT is providing us with a three-month free rent period, which commenced on August 15, 2018, and a tenant improvement allowance up to $3.8 million. We provided MEPT with a letter of credit to secure our obligations under the lease in the initial amount of $2.4 million, to be reduced to $1.8 million on the third anniversary of the rent commencement date and to $1.2 million on the fifth anniversary of the rent commencement date if we meet certain conditions set forth in the lease at each such time. This balance is included in deposits and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn November 12, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to sublease 4,723 square feet of office space located in Carlsbad, California. The commencement date was March 2018 and the term of the lease is 64 months with a four-month free rent period.\nRent expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for the lease of our office spaces, which resulted in a deferred rent balance of $4.8 million and $39,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nPurchase Commitments\nPurchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including, fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Such obligations are related principally to inventory purchase orders based on our current manufacturing needs and require significant lead times to be fulfilled by our vendors. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty\nLicense Fee Payment\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe describe the recently issued accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the period presented, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.", "item_7_truncated": "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Revised\nUnder Topic 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Originally\nReported\nUnder Topic 605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect\nof Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (121,559\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (109,751\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in\noperating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of\nperiod\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChargebacks: In the U.S., we estimate obligations resulting from contractual commitments with the government and other entities to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to our U.S. customer.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation settlement. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales - product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales - intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of license\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales and license expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales and license expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFCS is a severe and rare lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with this disease are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the WAYLIVRA program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. WAYLIVRA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL.

Licensing revenue of $12.0 million for 2018 relates to the upfront payment received from PTC Therapeutics related to our PTC License Agreement entered into in August 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any licensing revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million. We have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. In July 2017, we completed our IPO and raised $182.3 million in net proceeds from the IPO including the $50.0 million Novartis concurrent private placement. In April 2018, we completed a licensing transaction with Ionis to commercialize TEGSEDI. In conjunction with this transaction, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million. As a result of the MA approval for TEGSEDI in the EU, on August 3, 2018 we issued 1,597,571 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $40.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI, and as a result of the regulatory approval for TEGSEDI in the United States, on October 17, 2018 we issued 1,671,849 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $50.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI. See Note 7, License Agreements and Services Agreement with Ionis, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our TTR licensing agreement with Ionis. We plan to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 to further our commercialization efforts of TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and continue the advancement of our pipeline drugs.\nWe began to record revenues from product sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the approval of TEGSEDI in the U.S., EU and Canada. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, our revenues were derived from our collaboration agreement with Novartis and collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. The terms of such collaboration agreements may include consideration such as nonrefundable license fees, funding of research and development services, payments due upon the achievement of clinical and pre-clinical performance-based development milestones, regulatory milestones, manufacturing services, sales-based milestones and royalties on product sales.\nWe describe the recently issued accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) and 2016\nSubsequent to regulatory approval in Europe on July 11, 2018 and FDA approval in the U.S. on October 5, 2018, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we began to sell TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., the product is distributed through an exclusive distribution agreement with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that takes title to the product and represents our sole customer in the U.S. Our U.S. customer distributes TEGSEDI to a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor (collectively referred to as wholesalers\u201d), who then distribute the product to health care providers and patients. In Germany, the product is distributed through a non-exclusive distribution model with a 3PL that takes title to the product and currently represents our sole customer in Germany. Our customer in Germany then distributes TEGSEDI to hospitals and pharmacies in Germany.\nPrior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incur expenses for the manufacturing of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 our need to add infrastructure, implement internal systems and hire additional employees to operate as a public company; and \nNet loss for 2018 was $225.8 million compared to $121.6 million for the same period in 2017 (as revised). We incurred a higher net loss during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the development and pre-commercialization and commercial activities for TEGSEDI, the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for WAYLIVRA and our other drugs, and the ongoing global expansion of our company. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80. We had no outstanding preferred shares at December 31, 2018. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.74 and $2.87, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nOperating Lease\nThe following table sets forth our revenue for the periods presented (in thousands):\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\n\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2017 totaled $1.8 million compared to $0.3 million for 2016. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average short-term investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. The hallmark of FCS is extremely elevated triglycerides. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients with FCS worldwide. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our pipeline drugs, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform.\nCost of sales and license expense\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. However, we expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to commercialize TEGSEDI, or any other approved drug, including WAYLIVRA. We may seek to obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan.\nFollowing our IPO, we no longer grant Ionis options to our employees. Under the terms of the Ionis options, when we completed our IPO, the Ionis options our employees were holding were terminated. The termination of the Ionis options was determined not to be a modification, as the options were terminated based upon the existing contractual terms of the option agreements. As such, we will continue to recognize expense based on the valuation that was determined upon the grant date for options issued in 2016 or the modification date for options issued in 2015 and 2017.\nCommercial Infrastructure\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. As such, we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition. In the following paragraphs, we describe our most significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. As described below, there are specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies and we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as one may expect, and that best estimates may require adjustment. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nOverview\nResearch and development expenses were $120.9 million for the year 2018 compared to $118.3 million for the same period in 2017. The slight increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to development activities related to TEGSEDI, development activities related to our Phase 2b studies for AKCEA APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx which were initiated in the first quarter of 2018 and personnel and overhead expense to support our development efforts. This increase was offset primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash, a decrease in development activities for AKCEA APO(a)-LRx as the clinical study ended, finished data collection and reported topline results, as well as a decrease in development activities for WAYLIVRA. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 the design, initiation, progress, size, timing, costs and results of our clinical and nonclinical studies; \nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The RSUs we have granted vest annually over a four-year period.\nResearch and development expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $118.9 million for 2018 compared to $28.1 million for the same period in 2017. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization and commercialization activities necessary to launch TEGSEDI in the U.S., the EU and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the EU. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nGovernment rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under government programs, including Medicaid programs and Medicare in the United States. We estimate Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. On a quarterly basis, we update our estimates and record any adjustments in the period that we identify the adjustments. In Germany, pharmaceutical companies must grant a specified rebate percentage to the German government. We have included this rebate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized.\nIf we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOther income and other expense\nIncome Taxes\nPrior to December 2015, Ionis granted our employees options to purchase shares of Ionis' common stock, or Ionis options. In December 2015, we granted our employees holding Ionis options additional options to purchase shares of our common stock, or Akcea options.\nTEGSEDI is approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada and we are now beginning our commercialization efforts in these three regions. We began to generate product revenue from TEGSEDI drug sales in the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and losses may continue to increase as we develop, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize our other pipeline drugs. We are subject to all of the risks incident in developing and commercializing new drugs and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2018 totaled $5.7 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nProduct revenue. Product revenue of $2.2 million for 2018 relates to sales of TEGSEDI in the Unites States and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any product revenue.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves for changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past operating results, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\n \u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nRevenue\nPrior to the completion of our IPO we filed our tax returns on a consolidated and combined basis with Ionis for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. For financial statement purposes when we are required to file on a consolidated or combined basis, we calculate our income tax amounts, including net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, using a separate return methodology which determines income taxes as if we were a separate taxpayer from Ionis. Effective July 19, 2017, the date of our IPO, we are no longer included in the consolidated federal income tax return with Ionis. We determined the amount of federal tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that transferred to us upon deconsolidation from Ionis. We are still required to file most of our state tax returns on a consolidated or combined basis with Ionis. Therefore, for financial statement purposes we calculated our state income tax amounts using the separate return method.\n \u2022 our strategic collaborators' success in developing and commercializing our drugs; \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nImpact of Adoption\nNet loss for 2017 (as revised) was $121.6 million compared to $83.2 million for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80 compared to $2.88 for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08. We had no outstanding common stock at December 31, 2016. We incurred a higher net loss in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for our drugs, sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, the ongoing global expansion of our company and becoming and operating as a public company.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur lipid/cardiometabolic drugs, WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, are all based on antisense technology developed by Ionis. We are focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. On May 10, 2018, the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to support approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of people with FCS. On August 27, 2018, we and Ionis announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for WAYLIVRA. The FDA did not cite any new concerns beyond those described in the advisory committee briefing book, in which the main areas of focus were the dosing schedule and management of thrombocytopenia. We continue to feel strongly that WAYLIVRA demonstrates a favorable benefit/risk profile in people with FCS, as was reflected in the positive outcome from the Advisory Committee meeting. We received a preliminary notification of a Notice of Noncompliance withdrawal letter, or NON-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. We and Ionis are engaged with the FDA and plan to work with Health Canada to confirm a path forward for WAYLIVRA.\n\nAs a result of adopting Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we revised our comparative financial statements for the prior years as if Topic 606 had been effective for that period. On September 18, 2018, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to present recast consolidated financial statements for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition set forth in Topic 606. The financial information recast in the Form 8-K was originally filed with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018. Under Topic 605, we recognized revenue from our collaboration with Novartis over time on a straight-line basis. Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue from our collaboration with Novartis using the input method based on the total cost of performing services over time. As a result, the following financial statement line items for fiscal year 2017 were affected.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce the balance of our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We have incurred financial statement losses since inception and as a result we have a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the future realization of our net deferred tax assets and will reduce the valuation allowance in any such period in which we determine that all, or a portion, of our deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.\nTEGSEDI was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and was licensed by us in April 2018. In addition to TEGSEDI, we and Ionis are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx for hereditary and wild-type forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. We initiated clinical development of AKCEA-TTR-LRx in 2018.\nWe determined the stock-based compensation expense for the Ionis options at the date of grant and recognized compensation expense over the vesting period of the Ionis options. In December 2015, we accounted for the issuance of the Akcea options as a modification to the original grant of the Ionis options because the grant of the Ionis options and Akcea options essentially represented a single stock award as the exercisability provisions of the Ionis options and Akcea options grants were interrelated and mutually exclusive. The total compensation expense measured on the modification date was the sum of the grant date fair value of the Ionis options plus any incremental compensation cost resulting from the grant of the Akcea options.\nFor inventory related costs incurred subsequent to July 1, 2018, we reflected these amounts as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or market value under the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, basis. We periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of product sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management and if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by our management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard, discussed below under Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. Our adoption of the new revenue standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as discussed below in Note 2. This new revenue standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, then assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. When we offer options for additional goods or services, such as an option to license a drug in the future or for additional goods or services to be provided in the future, we evaluate whether such options are material rights that should be treated as additional performance obligations. We typically have not concluded that the option to license a drug or the options for additional goods or services that may be requested in the future under our collaboration agreement are material rights as the amounts attributable to such options represent standalone selling price, and therefore no consideration is allocated to these items at the inception of an agreement. When a partner exercises its option to\nWe began recognizing revenue under the collaboration with Novartis upon its initiation in 2017. Our collaboration revenue for 2018 was $50.6 million. In addition, we began to recognize TEGSEDI product revenue in 2018 and recognized licensing revenue in the third quarter of 2018 related to our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. Our product revenue and licensing revenue for 2018 was $2.2 million and $12.0 million respectively. Our total revenue for 2018 was $64.9 million. Our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, preparing to commercialize TEGSEDI and potentially WAYLIVRA upon approval, and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. The transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of our products and product candidates and the achievement of a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We incur meaningful expenses to support commercialization, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. Further, we incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe fair value of stock options granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options granted under the Ionis 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of Ionis' common stock on the date of grant. Options granted to employees vest over a four-year period, with 25 percent exercisable at the end of one year from the date of the grant and the balance vesting ratably, on a monthly basis, thereafter and have a term of ten years. Options granted to directors vest annually over a four-year period and have a term of ten years.\nCost of Product Sales\nCost of license of $7.2 million for 2018 consists of TTR sub-license expense due to Ionis related to the payment received as part of the licensing agreement entered into with PTC Therapeutics in August 2018. No license cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently expected to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nlicense a drug or requests the additional goods or services, a new performance obligation is created for that item. Once performance obligations are identified, we then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that we allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue based on the use of an output or input method. As of December 31, 2018, we have three revenue streams: our strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or collaboration agreement, with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we entered into in January 2017, our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, which we entered into in August 2018 and commercial product revenue related to sales of TEGESDI in the fourth quarter of 2018. For a complete discussion of the accounting for our revenue streams, see Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, Note 8, Collaboration and License Agreement with PTC Therapeutics, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nCost of sales - product expense of $1.7 million for 2018 consists of period costs and certain fixed costs associated with the manufacturing of TEGSEDI. We do not expect fixed costs will increase in direct correlation to sales. Based on our policy, we expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products as research and development prior to regulatory approval. Certain product costs of TEGSEDI units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 were incurred prior to the July 2018 EU approval, and therefore are not included in cost of sales during the year. We expect cost of sales to increase as we deplete these inventories. The cost of units sold during the period for which there was no cost basis was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. No product cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million and accumulated deficit of $522.0 million.\nIn addition, we maintain definite-lived intangible assets related to regulatory milestone payments made to Ionis that are recoverable through future cash flows from approved products, which are capitalized as license intangible assets. These assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which are generally estimated to be the remaining patent life. If our estimate of the product's useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then the shorter period is used. Intangible assets are amortized using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenue can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when future revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales to the extent the underlying license is commercialized or research and development prior to its commercialization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur strategic collaboration with Novartis has a potential aggregate transaction value of over $1.0 billion, plus royalties, which we would generally be required to share equally with Ionis. The calculation of potential aggregate transaction value assumes that Novartis licenses, successfully develops and achieves regulatory approval for both AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the U.S., E.U. and Japan, and that Novartis achieves pre-specified sales targets with respect to both drugs. In addition, to the upfront payment that we have received, for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $675.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $360.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. In addition, for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $240.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $265.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, and Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will pay 50% of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to Ionis as a sublicense fee. See Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue\nRevenue from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, upon transfer of title to the customer. We record shipping and handling costs within cost of goods sold on our consolidated statement of operations. We classify payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel for services that are distinct and priced at fair value as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Otherwise payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel that do not meet those criteria are classified as a reduction of revenue, as discussed further below. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. We have elected not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Our payment terms are generally between thirty to ninety days. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred since the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.\nFor AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, under our agreement with Novartis, after we complete Phase 2 development and if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we would receive an additional $150.0 million license fee which we would also share equally with Ionis. If exercised, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prior cardiovascular risk. If approved, Novartis would commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions. Similar to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\nCardiometabolic\n \u2022 the revenue, if any, generated from commercial sales of our drugs for which we receive marketing authorization, which may be affected by market conditions, including obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement of our drugs from third-party payors, including government programs and managed care organizations, and competition within the therapeutic class to which our drugs are assigned. \nWe obtained exclusive licenses from Ionis for specific patents that Ionis owns and maintains related to our drug pipeline. We recorded our licenses from Ionis as a capital contribution using the carryover basis of Ionis' historical cost for the related patents. We are amortizing our capitalized licenses over their estimated useful life, which is the term of the underlying individual patents owned by Ionis.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\n \u2022 our need to expand our development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees; \nFuture Funding Requirements\nOther incentives: In the U.S., other incentives include co-payment assistance we provide to patients with commercial insurance that have coverage and reside in states that allow co-payment assistance. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue. The estimate is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, wholesalers, health care providers and other indirect customers relating to the sale of TEGSEDI. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nInventory\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. We incurred no interest expense for 2016. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nWe estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy.\n \u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for our drugs; \nIn order to analyze and compare our results of operations to other similar companies, we believe it is important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards from our expenses. We believe non-cash stock-based compensation expense is not indicative of our operating results or cash flows from our operations. Further, we internally evaluate the performance of our operations excluding it. All numbers presented below exclude stock-based compensation expense unless otherwise indicated.\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (as revised)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded product revenue, net, of $2.2 million, which consist of $1.2 million of TEGSEDI sales in the U.S., and $1.0 million of TEGSEDI sales in Germany. The following table summarizes balances and activity in each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIonis formed Akcea as a wholly owned subsidiary to complete development of and commercialize Ionis' drugs to treat lipid disorders. We began business operations in January 2015. We licensed our cardiometabolic franchise from Ionis at the beginning of 2015. Prior to licensing these drugs, Ionis' employees performed all of the development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for these drugs either themselves or through third-party providers. As such, Ionis incurred all of the expenses associated with these activities and reported them in its consolidated financial statements. TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx were licensed from Ionis in April 2018. Prior to then, Ionis had been advancing these drugs in development and incurring the expenses for those activities. Under our license agreements with Ionis, Ionis continued and is continuing to conduct development, regulatory or manufacturing activities for our drugs and to charge us for this work. As of December 31, 2018, Ionis owed approximately 75 percent of our outstanding stock.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nAs a result of receiving marketing authorization, or MA, approval for TEGSEDI from the European Commission, or EC, in July 2018, we began recording all TEGSEDI related expenses as cost of product sales starting in July 2018. Cost of product sales consists of manufacturing costs, transportation and freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and distribution of TEGSEDI. Cost of product sales may also include period costs related to certain manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. Additionally, we expensed a significant portion of the cost of producing TEGSEDI that we will use in the commercial launch as research and development expense prior to the regulatory approval of TEGSEDI.\nOn November 12, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to sublease 4,723 square feet of office space located in Carlsbad, California. The commencement date was March 2018 and the term of the lease is 64 months with a four-month free rent period.\nLicense Fee Payment\nOn April 5, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with MEPT Seaport 13 Stillings LLC, or MEPT, for 30,175 square feet of office space located in Boston, Massachusetts for our new corporate headquarters. The commencement date of the lease was August 2018 and the initial term of the lease is 123 months with one five-year renewal option. We took occupancy of the office space in Boston, Massachusetts in September 2018. MEPT is providing us with a three-month free rent period, which commenced on August 15, 2018, and a tenant improvement allowance up to $3.8 million. We provided MEPT with a letter of credit to secure our obligations under the lease in the initial amount of $2.4 million, to be reduced to $1.8 million on the third anniversary of the rent commencement date and to $1.2 million on the fifth anniversary of the rent commencement date if we meet certain conditions set forth in the lease at each such time. This balance is included in deposits and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe are continuing to build our current commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved, as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. Our supply chain is fully operational in both the U.S. and E.U. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass\u2122 in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis. This program is intended to empower people with accurate genetic information, so they can make informed decisions about their healthcare.\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital of $186.5 million compared to working capital of $178.4 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital increased in 2018 primarily due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investments as a result of our financing activities. This increase is offset by activities related to our normal course of business. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding payable to Ionis was $18.9 million under our Amended Services Agreement with Ionis\nTrade discounts and allowances: We provide customary invoice discounts on TEGSEDI sales to our U.S. customer for prompt payment that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive and pay for various distribution services from our U.S. customer and wholesalers in the U.S. distribution channel. For services that are either not distinct from the sale of our product or for which we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value, such fees are classified as a reduction of product revenue.\nSee Note 9, Equity and Stock-based Compensation, for additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans.\nThe following table sets forth our cost of sales and license expense for the periods presented (in thousands):\nEstimated Liability for Research and Development Costs\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nResearch and development expenses were $118.3 million for 2017 and increased compared to $63.9 million for 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash. The progression of our other drugs in development, including AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, during 2017 also contributed to the increase in our expenses. In particular we commenced four Phase 2 trials in 2017. This increase in research and development expenses was offset in part by a decrease in external WAYLIVRA expenses primarily related to the completion of the phase 3 program. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. We recognize the value of the portion of the award that we ultimately expect to vest as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations. We reduce stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revise the expense in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nIn April 2018, the stockholders other than Ionis and its affiliates approved the development, commercialization, collaboration and license agreement, or TTR License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license from Ionis to TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx and a stock purchase agreement, or Ionis SPA, with Ionis, our majority shareholder, which we entered into on March 14, 2018. To support our commercialization of TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million.\nATTR\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following are the components of variable consideration related to product revenue:\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. We incurred no interest expense during 2018. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $28.1 million for 2017 and increased compared to $9.5 million for 2016. Our general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization activities necessary to launch WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the US, Canada and certain EU countries. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe are continuing to build our global infrastructure as we begin to commercialize TEGSEDI and prepare to commercialize WAYLIVRA in the E.U., and we have commercial teams in place in the U.S., E.U. and Canada. In addition, in August 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $43.4 million in research and development revenue (as revised) from our collaboration with Novartis, which we initiated in January 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue.\nWe value our stock option awards and stock purchase rights under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected principally by our estimated common stock fair value and requires us to make a number of other assumptions, including: the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the full retrospective transition method. Under this method, we revised our consolidated financial statements for prior period amounts including the periods included in this Report on Form 10-K, as if Topic 606 had been effective for such periods. The references as revised\u201d used herein refer to revisions of amounts originally reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as of December 31, 2017 as a result of our adoption of Topic 606.\nWe record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which vendors or service providers have not yet billed us. These liabilities are for products or services that we have received and primarily relate to ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies. These costs primarily include third-party clinical management costs, laboratory and analysis costs, toxicology studies and investigator grants. We have drugs in concurrent nonclinical and clinical studies at several sites throughout the world. To ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing nonclinical and clinical research and development costs during the period in which we incur such costs, we maintain an accrual to cover these costs. We update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis. The assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment. Upon settlement, these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual amounts.\nWe have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. Our borrowings under our line of credit agreement with Ionis converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017. We no longer have access to the line of credit. Additionally, in July 2017 we received $182.3 million in net proceeds from our IPO, including $25.0 million Ionis invested in our IPO and the Novartis concurrent private placement of $50.0 million.\nexclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which they would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect; \nWe expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to expand our commercial efforts for TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, for which we are in on going regulatory discussion in those same jurisdictions. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we may finance our cash needs through additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. In any event, we may not generate significant revenue from product sales prior to the use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. We do not have any committed external source of funds. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of stock or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include increased fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends, selling or licensing intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our drugs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds through stock offerings or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and commercialize our drugs even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize the drugs ourselves.\n\n\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the period presented, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nProduct Returns: Our U.S. customer has return rights and the wholesalers have limited return rights primarily related to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of revenue and a refund liability in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Based on the distribution model for TEGSEDI, contractual inventory limits with our customer and wholesalers and the price of TEGSEDI, we believe there will be minimal returns. Our customer in Germany only takes title to the product once it receives an order from a hospital or pharmacy and therefore does not maintain any inventory of TEGSEDI. Therefore, there is limited return risk and the Company has not recorded any return estimate in the transaction price for TEGSEDI sold in Germany.\nTEGSEDI is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the TTR protein. In patients with hATTR amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal genetic disease, both the hereditary and wild-type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient's life and eventually leads to death.\nTo maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. As part of our collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will pay Ionis the sublicense fee in Akcea common stock. Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis' exercise of its option to\nCost of sales expense - intangible asset amortization of $2.7 million for 2018 consist of amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the achievement of TEGSEDI regulatory milestones in the U.S. and E.U. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nIn 2018, we obtained TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, the ligand conjugated antisense, or LICA, drug in development for TTR, under an exclusive license from Ionis. With the licensing agreement, we have expanded our efforts to treat people with serious and under-served rare diseases focusing on transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, and cardiometabolic diseases.\nAt December 31, 2018 a majority of our physical inventory for TEGSEDI was produced prior to when we obtained regulatory approval and accordingly had no cost basis as we recorded the related costs as research and development expense in prior periods. At December 31, 2018 the amount of finished goods recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets related to our approved product TEGSEDI was $85,000.\nThis financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and our financial condition at December 31, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under Item 1A of Part I of this report, \"Risk Factors.\" In addition, the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements as indexed on page.", "item_7_text": "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nChargebacks: In the U.S., we estimate obligations resulting from contractual commitments with the government and other entities to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to our U.S. customer. Our U.S. customer charges us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. We record reserves for these chargebacks related to product sold to our U.S. customer during the reporting period, as well as our estimate of product that remains in the distribution channel at the end of the reporting period that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers in future periods.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation settlement. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nFCS is a severe and rare lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with this disease are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the WAYLIVRA program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. WAYLIVRA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Our other three lipid/cardiometabolic drugs are currently in Phase 2 clinical development.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 the number and characteristics of drugs that we may pursue; \nPurchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including, fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Such obligations are related principally to inventory purchase orders based on our current manufacturing needs and require significant lead times to be fulfilled by our vendors. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty\nResearch and development expense\nThe following table sets forth our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nRent expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for the lease of our office spaces, which resulted in a deferred rent balance of $4.8 million and $39,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur Relationship with Ionis\nIn 2016, we began concurrently granting Ionis options and Akcea options to our employees. Because the exercisability provisions of the awards are interrelated and mutually exclusive as described above, the fair values of the Ionis options and the Akcea options were determined on the date of grant and the option with the greater fair value was recognized over the vesting period of the awards. In 2017, we no longer concurrently granted Ionis and Akcea options. Our board of directors only receive grants under the Akcea option plan.\nResearch and development revenue. In 2018, we recognized $50.6 million compared to $43.4 million in 2017 (as revised), in research and development revenue from our collaboration with Novartis. The increase in research and development revenue is primarily the result of level of efforts related to activities for our AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx programs.\nOther income and other expense\nLicensing revenue. Licensing revenue of $12.0 million for 2018 relates to the upfront payment received from PTC Therapeutics related to our PTC License Agreement entered into in August 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any licensing revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million. We have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. In July 2017, we completed our IPO and raised $182.3 million in net proceeds from the IPO including the $50.0 million Novartis concurrent private placement. In April 2018, we completed a licensing transaction with Ionis to commercialize TEGSEDI. In conjunction with this transaction, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million. As a result of the MA approval for TEGSEDI in the EU, on August 3, 2018 we issued 1,597,571 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $40.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI, and as a result of the regulatory approval for TEGSEDI in the United States, on October 17, 2018 we issued 1,671,849 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $50.0 million regulatory milestone for TEGSEDI. See Note 7, License Agreements and Services Agreement with Ionis, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information about our TTR licensing agreement with Ionis. We plan to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 to further our commercialization efforts of TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and continue the advancement of our pipeline drugs.\nWe began to record revenues from product sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the approval of TEGSEDI in the U.S., EU and Canada. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, our revenues were derived from our collaboration agreement with Novartis and collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. The terms of such collaboration agreements may include consideration such as nonrefundable license fees, funding of research and development services, payments due upon the achievement of clinical and pre-clinical performance-based development milestones, regulatory milestones, manufacturing services, sales-based milestones and royalties on product sales.\nWe describe the recently issued accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) and 2016\nSubsequent to regulatory approval in Europe on July 11, 2018 and FDA approval in the U.S. on October 5, 2018, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we began to sell TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., the product is distributed through an exclusive distribution agreement with a third-party logistics (3PL) company that takes title to the product and represents our sole customer in the U.S. Our U.S. customer distributes TEGSEDI to a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor (collectively referred to as wholesalers\u201d), who then distribute the product to health care providers and patients. In Germany, the product is distributed through a non-exclusive distribution model with a 3PL that takes title to the product and currently represents our sole customer in Germany. Our customer in Germany then distributes TEGSEDI to hospitals and pharmacies in Germany.\nPrior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we incur expenses for the manufacturing of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Until the first reporting period when regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, we record all such costs as research and development expense.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 our need to add infrastructure, implement internal systems and hire additional employees to operate as a public company; and \nNet loss for 2018 was $225.8 million compared to $121.6 million for the same period in 2017 (as revised). We incurred a higher net loss during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the development and pre-commercialization and commercial activities for TEGSEDI, the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for WAYLIVRA and our other drugs, and the ongoing global expansion of our company. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80. We had no outstanding preferred shares at December 31, 2018. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.74 and $2.87, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nOperating Lease\nThe following table sets forth our revenue for the periods presented (in thousands):\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\n\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2017 totaled $1.8 million compared to $0.3 million for 2016. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average short-term investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. The hallmark of FCS is extremely elevated triglycerides. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients with FCS worldwide. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our pipeline drugs, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform.\nCost of sales and license expense\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. However, we expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to commercialize TEGSEDI, or any other approved drug, including WAYLIVRA. We may seek to obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan.\nFollowing our IPO, we no longer grant Ionis options to our employees. Under the terms of the Ionis options, when we completed our IPO, the Ionis options our employees were holding were terminated. The termination of the Ionis options was determined not to be a modification, as the options were terminated based upon the existing contractual terms of the option agreements. As such, we will continue to recognize expense based on the valuation that was determined upon the grant date for options issued in 2016 or the modification date for options issued in 2015 and 2017.\nCommercial Infrastructure\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. As such, we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition. In the following paragraphs, we describe our most significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. As described below, there are specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies and we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as one may expect, and that best estimates may require adjustment. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nOverview\nResearch and development expenses were $120.9 million for the year 2018 compared to $118.3 million for the same period in 2017. The slight increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to development activities related to TEGSEDI, development activities related to our Phase 2b studies for AKCEA APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx which were initiated in the first quarter of 2018 and personnel and overhead expense to support our development efforts. This increase was offset primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash, a decrease in development activities for AKCEA APO(a)-LRx as the clinical study ended, finished data collection and reported topline results, as well as a decrease in development activities for WAYLIVRA. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 the design, initiation, progress, size, timing, costs and results of our clinical and nonclinical studies; \nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The RSUs we have granted vest annually over a four-year period.\nResearch and development expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $118.9 million for 2018 compared to $28.1 million for the same period in 2017. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization and commercialization activities necessary to launch TEGSEDI in the U.S., the EU and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the EU. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nGovernment rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under government programs, including Medicaid programs and Medicare in the United States. We estimate Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payer mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. On a quarterly basis, we update our estimates and record any adjustments in the period that we identify the adjustments. In Germany, pharmaceutical companies must grant a specified rebate percentage to the German government. We have included this rebate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized.\nIf we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOther income and other expense\nIncome Taxes\nPrior to December 2015, Ionis granted our employees options to purchase shares of Ionis' common stock, or Ionis options. In December 2015, we granted our employees holding Ionis options additional options to purchase shares of our common stock, or Akcea options.\nTEGSEDI is approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada and we are now beginning our commercialization efforts in these three regions. We began to generate product revenue from TEGSEDI drug sales in the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and losses may continue to increase as we develop, seek regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize our other pipeline drugs. We are subject to all of the risks incident in developing and commercializing new drugs and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nInvestment income. Investment income for 2018 totaled $5.7 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in investment income was primarily due to a higher average investment balance and an increase in the interest rates on high quality debt and U.S. government agencies investments during 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nProduct revenue. Product revenue of $2.2 million for 2018 relates to sales of TEGSEDI in the Unites States and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not generate any product revenue.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves for changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past operating results, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management's best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\n \u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in thousands):\nRevenue\nPrior to the completion of our IPO we filed our tax returns on a consolidated and combined basis with Ionis for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. For financial statement purposes when we are required to file on a consolidated or combined basis, we calculate our income tax amounts, including net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, using a separate return methodology which determines income taxes as if we were a separate taxpayer from Ionis. Effective July 19, 2017, the date of our IPO, we are no longer included in the consolidated federal income tax return with Ionis. We determined the amount of federal tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that transferred to us upon deconsolidation from Ionis. We are still required to file most of our state tax returns on a consolidated or combined basis with Ionis. Therefore, for financial statement purposes we calculated our state income tax amounts using the separate return method.\n \u2022 our strategic collaborators' success in developing and commercializing our drugs; \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nImpact of Adoption\nNet loss for 2017 (as revised) was $121.6 million compared to $83.2 million for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per preferred share for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $1.80 compared to $2.88 for 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per common share owned by Ionis and owned by others for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as revised) was $3.08. We had no outstanding common stock at December 31, 2016. We incurred a higher net loss in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the increase in expenses related to pre-commercialization and development activities for our drugs, sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, the ongoing global expansion of our company and becoming and operating as a public company.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur lipid/cardiometabolic drugs, WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, are all based on antisense technology developed by Ionis. We are focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. With this positive opinion, and, pending adoption of the positive opinion by the EC, we plan to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. On May 10, 2018, the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to support approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of people with FCS. On August 27, 2018, we and Ionis announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for WAYLIVRA. The FDA did not cite any new concerns beyond those described in the advisory committee briefing book, in which the main areas of focus were the dosing schedule and management of thrombocytopenia. We continue to feel strongly that WAYLIVRA demonstrates a favorable benefit/risk profile in people with FCS, as was reflected in the positive outcome from the Advisory Committee meeting. We received a preliminary notification of a Notice of Noncompliance withdrawal letter, or NON-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. We and Ionis are engaged with the FDA and plan to work with Health Canada to confirm a path forward for WAYLIVRA.\n\nAs a result of adopting Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we revised our comparative financial statements for the prior years as if Topic 606 had been effective for that period. On September 18, 2018, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to present recast consolidated financial statements for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition set forth in Topic 606. The financial information recast in the Form 8-K was originally filed with the SEC in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018. Under Topic 605, we recognized revenue from our collaboration with Novartis over time on a straight-line basis. Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue from our collaboration with Novartis using the input method based on the total cost of performing services over time. As a result, the following financial statement line items for fiscal year 2017 were affected.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nCollaboration and License Revenue\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce the balance of our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We have incurred financial statement losses since inception and as a result we have a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the future realization of our net deferred tax assets and will reduce the valuation allowance in any such period in which we determine that all, or a portion, of our deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.\nTEGSEDI was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and was licensed by us in April 2018. In addition to TEGSEDI, we and Ionis are developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx for hereditary and wild-type forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. We initiated clinical development of AKCEA-TTR-LRx in 2018.\nWe determined the stock-based compensation expense for the Ionis options at the date of grant and recognized compensation expense over the vesting period of the Ionis options. In December 2015, we accounted for the issuance of the Akcea options as a modification to the original grant of the Ionis options because the grant of the Ionis options and Akcea options essentially represented a single stock award as the exercisability provisions of the Ionis options and Akcea options grants were interrelated and mutually exclusive. The total compensation expense measured on the modification date was the sum of the grant date fair value of the Ionis options plus any incremental compensation cost resulting from the grant of the Akcea options.\nFor inventory related costs incurred subsequent to July 1, 2018, we reflected these amounts as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or market value under the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, basis. We periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of product sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management and if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by our management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard, discussed below under Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. Our adoption of the new revenue standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as discussed below in Note 2. This new revenue standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, then assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. When we offer options for additional goods or services, such as an option to license a drug in the future or for additional goods or services to be provided in the future, we evaluate whether such options are material rights that should be treated as additional performance obligations. We typically have not concluded that the option to license a drug or the options for additional goods or services that may be requested in the future under our collaboration agreement are material rights as the amounts attributable to such options represent standalone selling price, and therefore no consideration is allocated to these items at the inception of an agreement. When a partner exercises its option to\nWe began recognizing revenue under the collaboration with Novartis upon its initiation in 2017. Our collaboration revenue for 2018 was $50.6 million. In addition, we began to recognize TEGSEDI product revenue in 2018 and recognized licensing revenue in the third quarter of 2018 related to our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics. Our product revenue and licensing revenue for 2018 was $2.2 million and $12.0 million respectively. Our total revenue for 2018 was $64.9 million. Our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, preparing to commercialize TEGSEDI and potentially WAYLIVRA upon approval, and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. The transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of our products and product candidates and the achievement of a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We incur meaningful expenses to support commercialization, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. Further, we incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe fair value of stock options granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options granted under the Ionis 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of Ionis' common stock on the date of grant. Options granted to employees vest over a four-year period, with 25 percent exercisable at the end of one year from the date of the grant and the balance vesting ratably, on a monthly basis, thereafter and have a term of ten years. Options granted to directors vest annually over a four-year period and have a term of ten years.\nCost of Product Sales\nCost of license of $7.2 million for 2018 consists of TTR sub-license expense due to Ionis related to the payment received as part of the licensing agreement entered into with PTC Therapeutics in August 2018. No license cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently expected to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nlicense a drug or requests the additional goods or services, a new performance obligation is created for that item. Once performance obligations are identified, we then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that we allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue based on the use of an output or input method. As of December 31, 2018, we have three revenue streams: our strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or collaboration agreement, with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we entered into in January 2017, our collaboration and license agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, which we entered into in August 2018 and commercial product revenue related to sales of TEGESDI in the fourth quarter of 2018. For a complete discussion of the accounting for our revenue streams, see Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, Note 8, Collaboration and License Agreement with PTC Therapeutics, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nCost of sales - product expense of $1.7 million for 2018 consists of period costs and certain fixed costs associated with the manufacturing of TEGSEDI. We do not expect fixed costs will increase in direct correlation to sales. Based on our policy, we expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products as research and development prior to regulatory approval. Certain product costs of TEGSEDI units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 were incurred prior to the July 2018 EU approval, and therefore are not included in cost of sales during the year. We expect cost of sales to increase as we deplete these inventories. The cost of units sold during the period for which there was no cost basis was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. No product cost of sales was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million and accumulated deficit of $522.0 million.\nIn addition, we maintain definite-lived intangible assets related to regulatory milestone payments made to Ionis that are recoverable through future cash flows from approved products, which are capitalized as license intangible assets. These assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which are generally estimated to be the remaining patent life. If our estimate of the product's useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then the shorter period is used. Intangible assets are amortized using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenue can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when future revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales to the extent the underlying license is commercialized or research and development prior to its commercialization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur strategic collaboration with Novartis has a potential aggregate transaction value of over $1.0 billion, plus royalties, which we would generally be required to share equally with Ionis. The calculation of potential aggregate transaction value assumes that Novartis licenses, successfully develops and achieves regulatory approval for both AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the U.S., E.U. and Japan, and that Novartis achieves pre-specified sales targets with respect to both drugs. In addition, to the upfront payment that we have received, for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $675.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $360.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. In addition, for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx we are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $240.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $265.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, and Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will pay 50% of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to Ionis as a sublicense fee. See Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue\nRevenue from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, upon transfer of title to the customer. We record shipping and handling costs within cost of goods sold on our consolidated statement of operations. We classify payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel for services that are distinct and priced at fair value as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Otherwise payments to customers or other parties in the distribution channel that do not meet those criteria are classified as a reduction of revenue, as discussed further below. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. We have elected not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Our payment terms are generally between thirty to ninety days. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred since the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.\nFor AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, under our agreement with Novartis, after we complete Phase 2 development and if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we would receive an additional $150.0 million license fee which we would also share equally with Ionis. If exercised, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prior cardiovascular risk. If approved, Novartis would commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide. Novartis will have 60 days plus additional time that could be required for Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, filing and review following the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions. Similar to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\nCardiometabolic\n \u2022 the revenue, if any, generated from commercial sales of our drugs for which we receive marketing authorization, which may be affected by market conditions, including obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement of our drugs from third-party payors, including government programs and managed care organizations, and competition within the therapeutic class to which our drugs are assigned. \nWe obtained exclusive licenses from Ionis for specific patents that Ionis owns and maintains related to our drug pipeline. We recorded our licenses from Ionis as a capital contribution using the carryover basis of Ionis' historical cost for the related patents. We are amortizing our capitalized licenses over their estimated useful life, which is the term of the underlying individual patents owned by Ionis.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\n \u2022 our need to expand our development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees; \nFuture Funding Requirements\nOther incentives: In the U.S., other incentives include co-payment assistance we provide to patients with commercial insurance that have coverage and reside in states that allow co-payment assistance. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue. The estimate is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, wholesalers, health care providers and other indirect customers relating to the sale of TEGSEDI. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nInventory\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. We incurred no interest expense for 2016. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nWe estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy.\n \u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for our drugs; \nIn order to analyze and compare our results of operations to other similar companies, we believe it is important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards from our expenses. We believe non-cash stock-based compensation expense is not indicative of our operating results or cash flows from our operations. Further, we internally evaluate the performance of our operations excluding it. All numbers presented below exclude stock-based compensation expense unless otherwise indicated.\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (as revised)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded product revenue, net, of $2.2 million, which consist of $1.2 million of TEGSEDI sales in the U.S., and $1.0 million of TEGSEDI sales in Germany. The following table summarizes balances and activity in each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIonis formed Akcea as a wholly owned subsidiary to complete development of and commercialize Ionis' drugs to treat lipid disorders. We began business operations in January 2015. We licensed our cardiometabolic franchise from Ionis at the beginning of 2015. Prior to licensing these drugs, Ionis' employees performed all of the development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for these drugs either themselves or through third-party providers. As such, Ionis incurred all of the expenses associated with these activities and reported them in its consolidated financial statements. TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx were licensed from Ionis in April 2018. Prior to then, Ionis had been advancing these drugs in development and incurring the expenses for those activities. Under our license agreements with Ionis, Ionis continued and is continuing to conduct development, regulatory or manufacturing activities for our drugs and to charge us for this work. As of December 31, 2018, Ionis owed approximately 75 percent of our outstanding stock.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nAs a result of receiving marketing authorization, or MA, approval for TEGSEDI from the European Commission, or EC, in July 2018, we began recording all TEGSEDI related expenses as cost of product sales starting in July 2018. Cost of product sales consists of manufacturing costs, transportation and freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and distribution of TEGSEDI. Cost of product sales may also include period costs related to certain manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. Additionally, we expensed a significant portion of the cost of producing TEGSEDI that we will use in the commercial launch as research and development expense prior to the regulatory approval of TEGSEDI.\nOn November 12, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to sublease 4,723 square feet of office space located in Carlsbad, California. The commencement date was March 2018 and the term of the lease is 64 months with a four-month free rent period.\nLicense Fee Payment\nOn April 5, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement with MEPT Seaport 13 Stillings LLC, or MEPT, for 30,175 square feet of office space located in Boston, Massachusetts for our new corporate headquarters. The commencement date of the lease was August 2018 and the initial term of the lease is 123 months with one five-year renewal option. We took occupancy of the office space in Boston, Massachusetts in September 2018. MEPT is providing us with a three-month free rent period, which commenced on August 15, 2018, and a tenant improvement allowance up to $3.8 million. We provided MEPT with a letter of credit to secure our obligations under the lease in the initial amount of $2.4 million, to be reduced to $1.8 million on the third anniversary of the rent commencement date and to $1.2 million on the fifth anniversary of the rent commencement date if we meet certain conditions set forth in the lease at each such time. This balance is included in deposits and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe are continuing to build our current commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved, as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. Our supply chain is fully operational in both the U.S. and E.U. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass\u2122 in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis. This program is intended to empower people with accurate genetic information, so they can make informed decisions about their healthcare.\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had working capital of $186.5 million compared to working capital of $178.4 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital increased in 2018 primarily due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investments as a result of our financing activities. This increase is offset by activities related to our normal course of business. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding payable to Ionis was $18.9 million under our Amended Services Agreement with Ionis\nTrade discounts and allowances: We provide customary invoice discounts on TEGSEDI sales to our U.S. customer for prompt payment that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive and pay for various distribution services from our U.S. customer and wholesalers in the U.S. distribution channel. For services that are either not distinct from the sale of our product or for which we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value, such fees are classified as a reduction of product revenue.\nSee Note 9, Equity and Stock-based Compensation, for additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans.\nThe following table sets forth our cost of sales and license expense for the periods presented (in thousands):\nEstimated Liability for Research and Development Costs\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nResearch and development expenses were $118.3 million for 2017 and increased compared to $63.9 million for 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily due to sublicensing expenses related to our collaboration with Novartis, which we incurred in the first quarter of 2017, the majority of which were non-cash. The progression of our other drugs in development, including AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, during 2017 also contributed to the increase in our expenses. In particular we commenced four Phase 2 trials in 2017. This increase in research and development expenses was offset in part by a decrease in external WAYLIVRA expenses primarily related to the completion of the phase 3 program. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. We recognize the value of the portion of the award that we ultimately expect to vest as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations. We reduce stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revise the expense in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nIn April 2018, the stockholders other than Ionis and its affiliates approved the development, commercialization, collaboration and license agreement, or TTR License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license from Ionis to TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx and a stock purchase agreement, or Ionis SPA, with Ionis, our majority shareholder, which we entered into on March 14, 2018. To support our commercialization of TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, Ionis purchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million.\nATTR\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following are the components of variable consideration related to product revenue:\nInterest expense. Interest expense is comprised entirely of interest incurred under our line of credit agreement with Ionis. We incurred no interest expense during 2018. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.7 million. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017 and we no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO.\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $28.1 million for 2017 and increased compared to $9.5 million for 2016. Our general and administrative expenses increased due to the ongoing buildout of our commercial organization and advancement of pre-commercialization activities necessary to launch WAYLIVRA, if approved for marketing in the US, Canada and certain EU countries. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nWe are continuing to build our global infrastructure as we begin to commercialize TEGSEDI and prepare to commercialize WAYLIVRA in the E.U., and we have commercial teams in place in the U.S., E.U. and Canada. In addition, in August 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $43.4 million in research and development revenue (as revised) from our collaboration with Novartis, which we initiated in January 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not generate any revenue.\nWe value our stock option awards and stock purchase rights under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected principally by our estimated common stock fair value and requires us to make a number of other assumptions, including: the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nOn February 22, 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx as part of our strategic collaboration with Novartis discussed in Note 6, Strategic Collaboration with Novartis. As a result we earned a license fee of $150.0 million of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will issue 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis as payment of the $75.0 million sublicense fee.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the full retrospective transition method. Under this method, we revised our consolidated financial statements for prior period amounts including the periods included in this Report on Form 10-K, as if Topic 606 had been effective for such periods. The references as revised\u201d used herein refer to revisions of amounts originally reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as of December 31, 2017 as a result of our adoption of Topic 606.\nWe record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which vendors or service providers have not yet billed us. These liabilities are for products or services that we have received and primarily relate to ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies. These costs primarily include third-party clinical management costs, laboratory and analysis costs, toxicology studies and investigator grants. We have drugs in concurrent nonclinical and clinical studies at several sites throughout the world. To ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing nonclinical and clinical research and development costs during the period in which we incur such costs, we maintain an accrual to cover these costs. We update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis. The assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment. Upon settlement, these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual amounts.\nWe have funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution that we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million from initiating our collaboration with Novartis that we received in the first quarter of 2017 and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis that we received in the first and second quarters of 2017. Our borrowings under our line of credit agreement with Ionis converted into shares of our common stock at the IPO price in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2017. We no longer have access to the line of credit. Additionally, in July 2017 we received $182.3 million in net proceeds from our IPO, including $25.0 million Ionis invested in our IPO and the Novartis concurrent private placement of $50.0 million.\nexclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Akcea and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which they would negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying Akcea increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect; \nWe expect to raise additional funding in the future to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to expand our commercial efforts for TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., E.U. and Canada, and WAYLIVRA, for which we are in on going regulatory discussion in those same jurisdictions. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $252.6 million as of December 31, 2018, together with the receipt of the $150.0 million license fee payment expected in March 2019 as a result of Novartis opt in for the ACKEA-APO(a)-LRx, and cash expected to be generated from sales of TEGSEDI, which has been approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of these financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we may finance our cash needs through additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. In any event, we may not generate significant revenue from product sales prior to the use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. We do not have any committed external source of funds. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of stock or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include increased fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends, selling or licensing intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our drugs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds through stock offerings or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and commercialize our drugs even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize the drugs ourselves.\n\n\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the period presented, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nProduct Returns: Our U.S. customer has return rights and the wholesalers have limited return rights primarily related to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of revenue and a refund liability in the period the related product revenue is recognized. Based on the distribution model for TEGSEDI, contractual inventory limits with our customer and wholesalers and the price of TEGSEDI, we believe there will be minimal returns. Our customer in Germany only takes title to the product once it receives an order from a hospital or pharmacy and therefore does not maintain any inventory of TEGSEDI. Therefore, there is limited return risk and the Company has not recorded any return estimate in the transaction price for TEGSEDI sold in Germany.\nTEGSEDI is an antisense drug designed to reduce the production of the TTR protein. In patients with hATTR amyloidosis, a severe, rare and fatal genetic disease, both the hereditary and wild-type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in tissues, such as the peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal functions of these tissues. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient's life and eventually leads to death.\nTo maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. As part of our collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx of which we will pay $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We will pay Ionis the sublicense fee in Akcea common stock. Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis' exercise of its option to\nCost of sales expense - intangible asset amortization of $2.7 million for 2018 consist of amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the achievement of TEGSEDI regulatory milestones in the U.S. and E.U. All amounts exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards.\nIn 2018, we obtained TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx, the ligand conjugated antisense, or LICA, drug in development for TTR, under an exclusive license from Ionis. With the licensing agreement, we have expanded our efforts to treat people with serious and under-served rare diseases focusing on transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, and cardiometabolic diseases.\nAt December 31, 2018 a majority of our physical inventory for TEGSEDI was produced prior to when we obtained regulatory approval and accordingly had no cost basis as we recorded the related costs as research and development expense in prior periods. At December 31, 2018 the amount of finished goods recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets related to our approved product TEGSEDI was $85,000.\nThis financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and our financial condition at December 31, 2018.
