MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nRoyalty Pharma plc is an English public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales that was created for the purpose of consolidating our predecessor entities and facilitating the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of our Class A ordinary shares that was completed in June 2020. Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma plc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. After the consummation of the Exchange Offer Transactions (as defined below) and execution of the Management Agreement (collectively, the Reorganization Transactions\u201d) in February 2020 and before the consummation of the IPO, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV ( RPI 2019 ICAV\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments, an Irish unit trust ( Old RPI\u201d).\nBusiness Overview\nWe are the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry. Since our founding in 1996, we have been pioneers in the royalty market, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies. We have assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles us to payments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry's leading therapies, which includes royalties on more than 35 commercial products, including AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson's Imbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer's Xtandi, Biogen's Tysabri, Johnson & Johnson's Tremfya, Gilead's Trodelvy, Merck's Januvia, Novartis' Promacta, Vertex's Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta, and ten development-stage product candidates. We fund innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly - directly when we partner with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when we acquire existing royalties from the original innovators.\nOur capital-efficient business model enables us to benefit from many of the most attractive characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry, including long product life cycles, significant barriers to entry and noncyclical revenues, but with substantially reduced exposure to many common industry challenges such as early stage development risk, therapeutic area constraints, high research and development costs, and high fixed manufacturing and marketing costs. We have a highly flexible approach that is agnostic to both therapeutic area and treatment modality, allowing us to acquire royalties on the most attractive therapies across the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe classify our royalty acquisitions by the approval status of the therapy at the time of acquisition:\n\u2022Approved Products - We acquire royalties in approved products that generate predictable cash flows and may offer upside potential from unapproved indications. Since inception in 1996 through 2021, we have deployed $15.0 billion of cash to acquire royalties on approved products. From 2012 through 2021, we have acquired $10.2 billion of royalties on approved products.\n\u2022Development-Stage Product Candidates - We acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates that have demonstrated strong clinical proof of concept. From 2012, when we began acquiring royalties on development-stage product candidates, through 2021, we have deployed $7.8 billion to acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates.\nWhile we classify our acquisitions in these two broad categories, several of our acquisitions of royalties on approved products were driven by the long-term potential of these products in other, unapproved indications. Similarly, some of our royalty acquisitions in development-stage product candidates are for products that are approved in other indications.\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners. We classify our product royalty acquisitions according to the following structures:\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\n\u2022Synthetic/Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we may also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product on which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\n\u2022Research & Development ( R&D\u201d) Funding - We have historically funded ongoing R&D, typically for large biopharmaceutical companies, in exchange for future royalties and/or milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved. We have also made upfront R&D payments to biotechnology companies to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nBackground and Format of Presentation\nIn connection with our IPO, we consummated an exchange offer on February 11, 2020 (the Exchange Date\u201d). Through the exchange offer, investors representing 82% of the aggregate limited partnership in the various partnerships owned by Old RPI (the Legacy Investors Partnerships\u201d), exchanged their limited partnership interests in the Legacy Investors Partnerships for limited partnership interests in RPI US Partners 2019, LP, a Delaware limited partnership or RPI International Holdings 2019, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (together, the Continuing Investors Partnerships\u201d). The exchange offer transaction together with (i) the concurrent incurrence of indebtedness under a new credit facility and (ii) the issuance of additional interests in Continuing Investors Partnerships to satisfy performance payments payable in respect of assets acquired prior to the date of the IPO are referred to as the Exchange Offer Transactions.\u201d\nFollowing our IPO, we operate and control the business affairs of Royalty Pharma Holdings Ltd, ( RP Holdings\u201d) through our controlling ownership of RP Holdings' Class A ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class A Interests\u201d) and RP Holdings' Class B ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class B Interests\u201d). We include RP Holdings and its subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements. RP Holdings is the sole owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, which is an Irish collective asset management entity formed to facilitate our Exchange Offer Transactions.\nAs a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions, we own, through our subsidiary RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPI Intermediate FT\u201d), an 82% economic interest in Old RPI. Through our 82% indirect ownership of Old RPI, we are legally entitled to 82% of the economics of Old RPI's wholly-owned subsidiaries, RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPIFT\u201d) and RPI Acquisitions (Ireland), Limited ( RPI Acquisitions\u201d), an Irish private limited company, and 66% of Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPCT\u201d).\nThe remaining 34% of RPCT is owned by the Legacy Investors Partnerships and Royalty Pharma Select Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPSFT\u201d), which is wholly owned by Royalty Pharma Select, an Irish unit trust. From the Exchange Date until the expiration of the Legacy Investors Partnerships' investment period on June 30, 2020 (the Legacy Date\u201d), the Legacy Investors Partnerships had the option to participate proportionately in any investment made by Old RPI. Following the Legacy Date, Old RPI ceased making new investments and each of Old RPI and the Legacy Investors Partnerships became legacy entities. Following the Legacy Date, we have made and plan to make new investments solely through our subsidiaries.\nFollowing management's determination that a high degree of common ownership exists in Royalty Pharma both before and after the Exchange Date, Royalty Pharma recognized Old RPI's assets and liabilities at the carrying value reflected on Old RPI's balance sheet as of the Exchange Date. Old RPI is our predecessor for financial reporting purposes. The results of operations in the following discussion is comprised of the financial results of Old RPI prior to the Reorganization Transactions, RPI 2019 ICAV subsequent to the Reorganization Transactions and before the consummation of the IPO, and Royalty Pharma plc subsequent to the consummation of the IPO.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, most of the royalties we acquire are treated as investments in cash flow streams and are thus classified as financial assets. These investments have yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest accounting methodology. Under this accounting methodology, we calculate the effective interest rate on each financial royalty asset using a forecast of the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the financial royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. The yield, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively, is then recognized via accretion into our income at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the financial royalty asset.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in this manner requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both our reported assets and liabilities and our income and revenue and expenses. The most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of income derived from our financial royalty assets, including management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties and the expected duration of the financial royalty asset. Our cash flow forecasts are generated and updated each reporting period by manually compiling sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates for each of the products in which we own royalties. We then calculate our expected royalty cash flows using these consensus sales forecasts. In any given reporting period, any decline or increase in the expected future cash flows associated with a financial royalty asset is recognized in our income statement as non-cash provision expense or provision income, respectively.\nAs a result of the non-cash charges associated with applying the effective interest method accounting methodology, our income statement activity in respect of many of our royalties can be volatile and unpredictable. Small declines in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts over a long time horizon can result in an immediate non-cash income statement expense recognition, even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. For example, in late 2014 we acquired the cystic fibrosis franchise royalty, which is classified as a financial royalty asset. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, declines in near-term sales forecasts of sell-side equity research analysts caused us to recognize non-cash provision expenses to the income statement and build up a corresponding cumulative allowance which reduced the gross balance for this financial royalty asset. Over the course of 10 quarters, we recognized non-cash provision expenses as a result of these changes in forecasts including non-cash provision expense of $743.2 million in 2016, ultimately reaching a peak cumulative allowance of $1.30 billion by September 30, 2017 related to this financial royalty asset. With the approval of the Vertex triple combination therapy, Trikafta, in October 2019, sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increased to reflect the larger addressable market and the extension of the expected duration of the Trikafta royalty. While small reductions in the cumulative allowance for the cystic fibrosis franchise were recognized as provision income in 2017 and 2018, there remained a $1.10 billion cumulative allowance that was fully reduced by $1.10 billion recognized in 2019 as a result of an increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts associated with the Trikafta approval. This example illustrates the volatility caused by our accounting model. Therefore, management believes investors should not look to income from royalties and the associated provision for changes in future cash flows as a measure of our near-term financial performance or as a source for predicting future income or growth trends.\nOur operations have historically been financed primarily with cash flows generated by our royalties. Due to the nature of our accounting methodology for our financial royalty assets, there is no direct correlation between our income from royalties and our royalty receipts. As noted above, income from such royalties is measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method accounting methodology. Given the importance of cash flows and their predictability to management's operation of the business, management uses royalty receipts as the primary measure of our operating performance. Royalty receipts refer to the summation of the following line items from our GAAP Statement of Cash Flows: Cash collections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates.\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on a non-GAAP basis. The closest comparable GAAP measure to each of the non-GAAP measures that management review is Net cash provided by operating activities. The key non-GAAP metrics we focus on are Adjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow, each of which is further discussed in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Results.\u201d\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, which is derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\nRefer to the section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures.\nPortfolio Overview\nOur portfolio consists of royalties on more than 35 marketed therapies and ten development-stage product candidates. The therapies in our portfolio address therapeutic areas such as rare disease, cancer, neurology, infectious disease, hematology and diabetes, and are delivered to patients across both primary and specialty care settings. The table below includes royalty receipts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in order of contributions to royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td>

Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Transactions, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest (defined below).\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial highlights\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities is the closest comparable GAAP financial measure to the supplemental non-GAAP liquidity measures that follow.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Receipts (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Flow (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nIn connection with our IPO, Royalty Pharma plc became a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in RP Holdings, which is the sole equity owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, an entity that is included in our consolidated financial statements. We report non-controlling interest related to four minority interests in our subsidiaries held by third parties.\n1. The first minority interest is attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the assets in Old RPI expire.\n2. The second minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class C ordinary share (the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest\u201d) held by RPI EPA Holdings, LP ( EPA Holdings\u201d), an affiliate of the Manager. Income will not be allocated to this non-controlling interest until certain conditions are met.\n3. The third minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held indirectly by the Continuing Investors Partnerships, which represent an approximate 29% ownership interest in RP Holdings as of December 31, 2021 and are exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 44,763 thousand RP Holdings Class B Interests were exchanged for our Class A ordinary shares.\n4. The fourth minority interest is attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT as a result of a 2011 reorganization transaction. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and is expected to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\nThe fourth non-controlling interest related to ownership in RPCT held by RPSFT, is the only non-controlling interest that existed prior to the Exchange Offer Transactions and is reflected in our financial statements through December 31, 2019. The non-controlling interest related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI is reflected in our financial statements from and after the Exchange Date. The other two non-controlling interests are reflected in our financial statements from and after the date of our IPO. All of the results of operations of RP Holdings, Old RPI and RPCT are consolidated into our financial statements.\nFollowing the IPO, EPA Holdings is entitled to receive Equity Performance Awards through its RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. Equity Performance Awards owed to EPA Holdings will be recognized as an equity transaction when the obligation becomes due and will impact the income allocated to non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest at that time. We do not currently expect any material Equity Performance Awards to be payable until certain performance conditions are met, which we do not expect to occur until the mid-2020s.\nTotal income and other revenues\nTotal income and other revenues is primarily comprised of income from our financial royalty assets, royalty revenue from our intangible royalty assets, and royalty income arising from successful commercialization of products developed through joint R&D funding arrangements. Most of our royalties on both approved products and development-stage product candidates that are not accounted for as R&D funding expense are classified as financial assets as our ownership rights are generally passive in nature. In instances in which we acquire a royalty that does include more substantial rights or ownership of the underlying intellectual property, we classify such royalties as intangible assets.\nWe recognize interest income related to our financial royalty assets. Royalty revenue relates solely to revenue from our DPP-IV patent estate for which the patent rights have been licensed to various counterparties. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the royalty payors accounting for greater than 10% of our total income and other revenues in any one year are shown in the table below:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty Payor </td> <td> </td> <td>Product(s) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vertex </td> <td> </td> <td>Cystic fibrosis franchise </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AbbVie </td> <td> </td> <td>Imbruvica </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gilead </td> <td> </td> <td>HIV franchise, Letairis, Lexiscan, Trodelvy (1) </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Biogen </td> <td> </td> <td>Tysabri </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We began recognizing income related to Trodelvy in the three months ended June 30, 2020.\n*Represents less than 10%.\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nOur financial royalty assets represent investments in cash flow streams with yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method. We calculate the effective interest rate using forecasted expected cash flows to be received over the life of the royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. Interest income is recognized at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the asset, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively. As changes in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates are updated on a quarterly basis, the effective rate of return changes. For example, if sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increase, the yield to derive income on a financial royalty asset will increase and result in higher income for subsequent periods.\nVariables affecting the recognition of interest income from financial royalty assets on individual products under the prospective effective interest method include any one of the following: (1) additional acquisitions, (2) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (3) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (4) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (5) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments. Our financial royalty assets are directly linked to sales of underlying pharmaceutical products whose life cycle typically peaks at a point in time, followed frequently by declining sales trends due to the entry of generic competition, resulting in natural declines in the asset balance and periodic interest income over the life of our royalties. The recognition of interest income from royalties requires management to make estimates and assumptions around many factors, including those impacting the variables noted above.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets is derived from sales of Januvia, Janumet and other DPP-IV products by our licensees.\nOther royalty income\nOther royalty income includes primarily income from financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized by the expected expiry date and royalty income from synthetic royalties arising out of R&D funding arrangements. Occasionally, a royalty asset may be amortized on an accelerated basis due to collectability concerns, which, if resolved, may result in future cash collections when no financial royalty asset remains. Similarly, we may continue to collect royalties on a financial royalty asset beyond the estimated patent expiration date by which the financial asset was amortized in full. In each scenario where a financial royalty asset has been fully amortized, income from such royalty is recognized as Other royalty income.\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nThe provision for changes in expected future cash flows from financial royalty assets includes the following:\n\u2022the movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nThe provision for changes in expected cash flows is the current period activity resulting from adjustments to the cumulative allowance for changes in expected cash flows, which is netted against the non-current portion of Financial royalty assets, net balance on the consolidated balance sheets. As discussed above, income is accreted on our financial royalty assets using the effective interest method. As we update our forecasted cash flows on a periodic basis and recalculate the present value of the remaining future cash flows, any shortfall when compared to the carrying value of the financial royalty asset is recorded directly to the income statement through the line item Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets. If, in a subsequent period, there is an increase in expected cash flows or if actual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously expected, we reduce the cumulative allowance previously established for a financial royalty asset for the incremental increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. This results in provision income (i.e., a credit to the provision).\nMost of the same variables and management's estimates affecting the recognition of interest income on our financial royalty assets also impact the provision. In any period, we will recognize provision income or expense as a result of the following factors: (1) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (2) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (3) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (4) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments.\nUpon the adoption on January 1, 2020 of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), we recorded a cumulative adjustment to Retained earnings of $192.7 million to recognize an allowance for current expected credit losses on our portfolio of financial royalty assets. The Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets reflects the activity for the period, primarily new financial royalty assets with limited protective rights and changes in the underlying cash flow forecasts used in the effective interest model to measure income from our financial royalty assets.\nR&D funding expense\nR&D funding expense consists of upfront and ongoing R&D payments we have made to counterparties to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates. Ongoing R&D payments are made as the related development-stage product candidates undergo clinical trials with our counterparties. These expenditures relate to the activities performed by our counterparties to develop and test new products, to test existing products for treatment in new indications, and to ensure product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses include primarily Operating and Personnel Payments, legal expenses, other expenses for professional services and share-based compensation. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the Adjusted Cash Receipts for each quarter and 0.25% of the value of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. The operating and personnel payments for Old RPI, an obligation of the Legacy Investors Partnerships as a non-controlling interest in Old RPI and for which the expense is reflected in our consolidated net income, are payable in equal quarterly installments and calculated as the greater of $1 million per quarter and 0.3125% of royalties from Royalty Investments (as defined in the limited partnership agreements of the Legacy Investors Partnerships) during the previous twelve calendar months.\nPrior to the Exchange Date, operating and personnel payments were fixed and grew at 5% annually and were not linked to any financial line item.\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nLegacy SLP Interest\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we acquired an equity method investment from the Continuing Investors Partnerships in the form of a special limited partnership interest in the Legacy Investors Partnerships (the Legacy SLP Interest\u201d) in exchange for issuing shares in our subsidiary. The Legacy SLP Interest entitles us to the equivalent of performance distribution payments that would have been paid to the general partner of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and a performance income allocation on a similar basis. The performance income allocation attributable to us is equal to the general partner's former contractual rights to the income of the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nAs the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the value of the Legacy SLP Interest is expected to decline over time. Our equity method investee, the Legacy Investors Partnerships, also owns a non-controlling interest in Old RPI.\nThe Avillion Entities\nThe Avillion entities (as defined below) partner with global biopharmaceutical companies to perform R&D in exchange for success-based milestones and/or royalties once products are commercialized.\nIn December 2017, our equity method investee Avillion Financing I, LP ( Avillion I\u201d) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for Pfizer's Bosulif to expand its label into front-line chronic myeloid leukemia, which triggered a series of contractual fixed payments from Pfizer to Avillion I over a 10-year period, which we recognize through receipt of Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn 2019, we entered into an amended agreement with BAv Financing II, LP ( Avillion II\u201d, or, together with Avillion I, the Avillion Entities\u201d), to invest $19.0 million to fund approximately 50% of the costs of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the use of Merck KGaA's anti-IL 17 nanobody M1095 (the Merck KGaA Asset\u201d) for the treatment of psoriasis in exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments. During 2020, our involvement in the development for the Merck KGaA Asset ceased. We do not expect to record significant earnings or losses in the future related to this investment.\nIn July 2021, we entered into an amended agreement with Avillion II to increase our investment from $105.0 million to $122.5 million over multiple years to fund a portion of the costs for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of Avillion II, which is a party to a co-development agreement with AstraZeneca to advance PT027 through a global clinical development program for the treatment of asthma in exchange for royalties, a series of success-based milestones, and other potential payments.\nOther expense/(income), net\nOther expense/(income), net primarily includes the change in fair market value of our equity securities and the unrealized (gains)/losses on our available for sale debt securities, including related forwards and derivatives. Other expense/(income), net also includes losses on extinguishment of debt and interest income.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nSubsequent to our IPO, net income attributable to non-controlling interest includes the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships and will include net income attributable to the Class C Special Interest held by EPA Holdings once certain conditions have been met. Future net income attributable to the non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares.\nAs of and following the Exchange Date, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes the Legacy Investors Partnerships' approximately 18% share of earnings in Old RPI. As the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the related net income attributable to this non-controlling interest is expected to decline over time.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes RPSFT's 20% share of earnings in RPCT, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Old RPI. We expect net income attributable to this non-controlling interest to decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

royalty interest that we acquired in the three months ended December 31, 2020. We also recorded $57.0 million in income in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to newly acquired assets in 2021, primarily Cabometyx/Cometriq, Tremfya and Oxlumo. The increase in income was partially offset by declines from the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\nRevenue from intangible royalty interests increased by $27.9 million, or 19.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to the expected recovery of underpaid royalties on Tradjenta of approximately $16.5 million based on a legal judgment received in a litigation with Boehringer Ingelheim.\nOther royalty income\nOther royalty income increased by $34.1 million, or 179.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by increased income from Nurtec ODT and Trodelvy that arose from our R&D funding agreements with Biohaven and Immunomedics, respectively. Other royalty income in the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes income from the HIV franchise, a fully amortized financial royalty asset, and Letairis, which was also fully amortized, but for which we expect minimal residual royalty income.\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nThe breakdown of our provision for changes in expected future cash flows includes the following:\n\u2022movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nAs the former activity is a combination of income and expense items, the provision breakdown by product, exclusive of the provision for current expected credit losses, is as follows, based on the largest contributors to each year's provision income or expense:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tazverik </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>IDHIFA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Imbruvica </td> <td> </td> <td>189,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Imbruvica </td> <td> </td> <td>46,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Emgality </td> <td> </td> <td>68,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tysabri </td> <td> </td> <td>40,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cystic fibrosis franchise </td> <td> </td> <td>48,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Soliqua </td> <td> </td> <td>32,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tysabri </td> <td> </td> <td>(96,103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Xtandi </td> <td> </td> <td>(187,059) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>43,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>53,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total provision, exclusive of provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>465,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total provision, exclusive of provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>74,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for current expected credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,913) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Provision for current expected credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>156,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total provision expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>452,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total provision expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total provision expense of $452.8 million, of which $465.8 million and $12.9 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision income for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for Tazverik, Imbruvica, Emgality and the cystic fibrosis franchise, primarily due to significant declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Tysabri. The current expected credit loss activity in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in provision income that was primarily driven by a significant decrease in current expected credit losses related to Tazverik as a result of the corresponding significant decline in the financial asset value. This was partially offset by provision expense for credit losses recognized as a result of the increases to our portfolio of financial royalty assets with limited protective rights, primarily related to zavegepant from a $100.0 million funding payment we made to Biohaven upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program and a new royalty interest in Cabometyx/Cometriq.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded total provision expense of $230.8 million, of which $74.7 million and $156.2 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision expense for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for IDHIFA, which was acquired in the year ended December 31, 2020, and for Imbruvica and Tysabri due to declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Xtandi. We recognized provision expense for current expected credit losses as a result of our adoption of the new accounting standard in the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision expense for current expected credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven primarily by certain additions to our portfolio of financial royalty assets, including the additional tranche of Tazverik and our acquisition of the zavegepant royalty.\nR&D funding expense\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of $193.2 million in upfront R&D funding and $6.9 million in ongoing R&D expenses, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi. The increase of R&D funding expense of $173.8 million, or 661.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by upfront R&D funding of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst in November 2021 and $90.0 million related to royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys in July 2021.\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $20.5 million in ongoing development-stage funding payments, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi, and $5.8 million in upfront funding related to a royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst.\nG&A expenses\nG&A expenses were relatively flat in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther operating expenses\nOther operating expenses were $65.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge related to the write-off of our omecamtiv mecarbil financial royalty asset balance of $90.2 million, net of cumulative allowance of $25.2 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, it was announced that omecamtiv mecarbil, a development stage product, did not meet the clinical trial objectives. There was no comparable activity in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nWe recorded equity in losses of non-consolidated affiliates of $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates of 44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEquity in earnings of the Legacy SLP Interest was $8.9 million and $62.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity in losses of the Avillion Entities was $28.4 million and $17.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $9.1 million, or 5.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by interest expense related to the $1.3 billion senior unsecured notes issued in July 2021 ( 2021 Notes\u201d) offset by the lower interest expense related to the $6.0 billion senior unsecured notes issued in September 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), which had a lower weighted average interest rate compared to the senior secured credit facilities that were in place during the year ended December 31, 2020. We refer to the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes, collectively, as the Notes\u201d.\nRefer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for additional discussion of the Notes and our debt refinancings in 2020.\nOther expense/(income), net\nOther expense, net of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily comprised of net losses on equity securities of $48.1 million, including losses on MorphoSys ordinary shares and Epizyme common stock, partially offset by a gain on Biohaven common shares; and losses of $21.5 million on our derivative financial instruments related to our treasury rate lock contracts that were unwound and settled in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. The losses were partially offset by interest income of $50.9 million related to our Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and a gain of $17.9 million on the unrealized change in fair value of our available for sale debt securities.\nOther income, net of $219.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily comprised of net gains on equity securities of $247.1 million, of which $292.3 million was driven by the redemption of our investment in Immunomedics common stock upon Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics in October 2020 and $66.0 million was related to an increase in share price of our investment in Biohaven common shares. These gains were partially offset by a loss of $120.1 million related to a decrease in share price of our investment in Epizyme common stock. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized $42.1 million in losses on our derivative financial instruments, primarily related to Epizyme warrants as a result of the decrease in Epizyme common stock price. Additionally, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $30.5 million related to the debt refinancings completed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nNet income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships was $297.3 million and $317.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the IPO in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the full period of net income in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income attributable to Continuing Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to RP Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was further driven by the ongoing exchanges in 2021 by investors in the Continuing Investors Partnerships who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests for our Class A ordinary shares, resulting in a decline in the Continuing Investors Partnerships' ownership of RP Holdings.\nNet income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships, which arose in February 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, was $266.6 million and $321.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the Exchange Date in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to Old RPI in 2021.\nNet income attributable to RPSFT was $57.6 million and $88.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect net income attributable to RPSFT to continue to decline as the royalty assets owned by RPCT mature.\nKey developments and upcoming events relating to our portfolio\nThe key developments impacting our cash receipts and income and revenue from our royalty interests are discussed below:\nCommercial Products\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise. In October 2019, Vertex received approval from the FDA for Trikafta for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older who have at least one copy of thedel mutation.\nIn August 2020, Vertex announced that the EC had granted marketing authorization of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older with onedel mutation and one minimal function mutation, or twodel mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\nIn December 2020, the FDA expanded the eligibility for Trikafta to include people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older with certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nIn April 2021, Vertex announced EC approval for Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have at least onedel mutation.\nIn June 2021, Vertex announced that FDA approved Trikafta for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis ages 6 through 11 who have at least onedel mutation or have certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nIn January 2022, Vertex announced that the EC granted approval for the label expansion of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients ages 6 through 11 years old who have at least onedel mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\n\u2022Tysabri. In April 2021, Biogen announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for a subcutaneous injection of Tysabri to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Biogen also announced that it had received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for its sBLA for subcutaneous Tysabri. The Complete Response Letter indicates that the FDA is unable to approve Biogen's filing as submitted. Biogen announced that it is evaluating the Complete Response Letter and will determine next steps in the United States.\nIn August 2021, Biogen announced results from Phase 3b NOVA study evaluation every six-week dosing with Tysabri intravenous administration in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Results show that every six-week Tysabri intravenous administration provides a high level of efficacy in controlling multiple sclerosis disease activity in patients who switched from the approved every four-week dosing regimen.\n\u2022Imbruvica. In April 2020, Imbruvica received FDA approval for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\nIn August 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL. This milestone marked the 11th FDA approval for Imbruvica since it was first approved in 2013 and sixth in CLL.\nIn June 2021, Phase 3 GLOW study results for Imbruvica in combination with Venetoclax for the treatment of first-line CLL and SLL demonstrated superior progression-free survival versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab as a first-line treatment of CLL. The study also showed improved duration of remission and significantly improved depth of remission. AbbVie has indicated that approval could occur in 2022.\nIn August 2021, AbbVie announced that the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware had issued a decision holding patent rights relating to Imbruvica were valid and infringed by a generic product from Alvogen and Natco. The decision, which is subject to appeal, prohibits regulatory approval of that generic product until the last AbbVie patent expires. Previously, AbbVie entered into several settlement and license agreements with other generic companies. Consequently, AbbVie does not expect any generic product entry prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted.\n\u2022Xtandi. In December 2019, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the FDA approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer.\nIn May 2021, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the EC approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\nIn September 2021, Astellas Pharma and Pfizer announced that Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) reduced the risk of death by 34% compared to placebo plus ADT in the Phase 3 ARCHES study in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The primary results from the ARCHES trial were published in 2019.\nAstellas and Pfizer have indicated that there could be a potential readout of the Phase 3 EMBARK trial for high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer in the second half of 2022.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT. In February 2020, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The FDA approval of Nurtec ODT triggered a redemption provision related to our investment in the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares, which entitles us to receive a fixed payment amount of $250.0 million payable in equal quarterly payments from March 31, 2021 through December 31, 2024.\nIn May 2021, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the preventative treatment of migraine, indicated for adult patients with episodic migraine who experience less than 15 headache days per month.\nIn November 2021, Biohaven announced a strategic collaboration with Pfizer for the commercialization of rimegepant outside the United States. Pfizer also gains rights outside the U.S. to zavegepant, which is being studied in an intranasal delivery and an oral formulation in Phase 3 clinical trials for migraine indications.\nBiohaven has indicated it expects an EMA decision on Vydura (rimegepant) in the first half of 2022.\n\u2022Trodelvy. In April 2020, Immunomedics announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.\nIn September 2020, Gilead and Immunomedics announced that Gilead would acquire Immunomedics for approximately $21 billion in cash. In 2018, we entered into a partnership with Immunomedics whereby we acquired a tiered sales-based royalty on Trodelvy for $175.0 million and acquired 4,373,178 shares of Immunomedics common stock for $75.0 million. Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics closed in October 2020, resulting in gross cash proceeds upon redemption of our Immunomedics common stock of approximately $385 million.\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced the FDA granted full approval to Trodelvy for adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for metastatic disease. The approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study.\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced that the FDA granted an accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either a programmed death receptor-1 or a programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor. The accelerated approval was based on data from the international Phase 2, single-arm TROPHY study.\nIn June 2021, Gilead announced superior outcomes to standard of care in second-line treatment of metastatic TNBC in the Phase 3 ASCENT study. Trodelvy more than doubled overall survival as a second-line treatment in the new ASCENT subgroup analysis.\nIn October 2021, Gilead announced a collaboration with Merck & Co. to investigate Trodelvy in combination with Keytruda as a first-line treatment for people with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC.\nIn November 2021, Gilead announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Trodelvy as a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for advanced disease. The EC's decision is supported by results from the Phase 3 ASCENT study, where Trodelvy reduced the risk of death by 49% and improved median overall survival to 11.8 months versus 6.9 months with physician's choice of chemotherapy.\nIn January 2022, Gilead announced it has entered into two clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with Merck & Co. to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As part of the collaboration, Merck will sponsor a global Phase 3 clinical trial of Trodelvy in combination with Keytruda as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the companies recently established an agreement whereby Gilead will sponsor a Phase 2 signal-seeking study evaluating combinations that include pembrolizumab in first-line NSCLC.\nGilead has indicated that it expects progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival data from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial in hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative metastatic breast cancer in March 2022.\n\u2022Cabometyx. In January 2021, Exelixis announced that the FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a first-line treatment in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo. The approval was based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER trial, in which the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo significantly improved overall survival while doubling progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC.\nIn March 2021, Ipsen announced that the EC approved the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.\nIn May 2021, Exelixis announced results from cohort six of COSMIC-021, a Phase 1b trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In high-risk patients, the combination of Cabometyx and atezolizumab resulted in objective response rates of 27% and 18% per investigator assessment and Blinded Independent Radiology Committee, respectively.\nIn June 2021, Exelixis and Ipsen announced that COSMIC-312, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The trial met one of its primary endpoints by demonstrating significant improvement in progression-free survival at the planned primary analysis. However, a prespecified interim analysis was not statistically significant for the second primary endpoint of overall survival. Based on the preliminary overall survival data, Exelixis anticipates that the probability of reaching statistical significance at the time of the final analysis is low.\nIn August 2021, Exelixis announced that their partners Takeda and Ono received approval in Japan for Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic RCC. Approval is based on the CheckMate -9ER trial of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo, which demonstrated superior overall survival and doubled mean progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib, with a favorable safety profile.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced detailed results from the expanded Cohort 6 of the Phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic CRPC, which included patients with metastatic CRPC who had been previously treated with novel hormone therapies enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate used along with prednisone. Following discussions with FDA, Exelixis will not pursue a regulatory submission for the combination regimen based on cohort 6 of COSMIC-021. CONTACT-02, a global Phase 3 pivotal trial that initiated enrollment in June 2020 may serve as a basis for future regulatory applications.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with previously treated radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. The approval was based on the Phase 3 COSMIC-311 pivotal trial.\nExelixis has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the COSMIC-313 trial in 1L RCC in the first half of 2022 and initial Phase 3 data in the second half of 2022 from CONTACT-01 in metastatic NSCLC and CONTACT-03 in advanced or metastatic RCC.\n\u2022Evrysdi. In August 2020, the FDA approved Evrysdi, the first at-home, orally administered treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children ages 2 months and older.\nIn March 2021, Roche announced that the EC approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in patients two months of age and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four splicing modifier of motor neuron 2 copies.\nIn June 2021, Evrysdi was approved in Japan for the treatment of SMA.\n\u2022Orladeyo. In December 2020, BioCryst announced that Orladeyo was approved by the FDA for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ages 12 years and older.\nIn January 2021, Orladeyo was approved in Japan, becoming the first and only prophylactic HAE medication approved in the region.\nIn April 2021, BioCryst announced that the EC approved Orladeyo for the prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older.\nIn April 2021, BioCryst announced approval of Japanese National Health Insurance System price listing of Orladeyo for prophylactic treatment of HAE.\n\u2022Oxlumo. In July 2021, Alnylam announced results from ILLUMINATE-C, a Phase 3 open-label study of lumasiran in patients of all ages with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1 associated with progressive decline in renal function. Results from the primary analysis at six months demonstrated a substantial reduction in plasma oxalate from baseline in patients with advanced disease, including those on hemodialysis. The safety and tolerability profile of lumasiran following six months of treatment was encouraging across all ages, with no drug related serious adverse events and injection site reactions as the most common adverse event.\nIn December 2021, Alnylam submitted a supplemental New Drug Application for lumasiran to the FDA and a Type II Variation with the EMA for the reduction of plasma oxalate in the treatment of patients with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1.\nDevelopment-Stage Product Candidates\n\u2022Aficamten. In February 2022, Cytokinetics announced positive topline results from Cohort 3 of the REDWOOD-HCM Phase 2 trial. Results from Cohort 3 showed that substantial reductions in the average resting LVOT-G as well as the post-Valsalva LVOT-G were achieved for patients with oHCM and a resting or post-Valsalva LVOT-G of \u226550 mmHg whose background therapy included disopyramide and in the majority a beta-adrenergic blocker. The safety and tolerability of aficamten were consistent with prior experience in REDWOOD-HCM with no treatment interruptions and no serious adverse events attributed to treatment reported by the investigators.\nIn December 2021, Cytokinetics announced the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for aficamten for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM based on results from REDWOOD-HCM. Cytokinetics has indicated it plans to initiate a pivotal study of aficamten in oHCM in the first quarter of 2022.\n\u2022Gantenerumab. In October 2021, Roche announced that gantenerumab, an anti-amyloid beta antibody developed for subcutaneous administration, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of people living with Alzheimer's disease. This designation is based on data showing that gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid plaque, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, in the ongoing SCarlet RoAD and Marguerite RoAD open-label extension trials, as well as other studies. Roche has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the GRADUATE 1/2 trial in Alzheimer's disease in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\u2022Omecamtiv mecarbil. In November 2020, Amgen, Cytokinetics and Servier presented the results of GALACTIC-HF study, a Phase 3 trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure, at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. The trial met the primary composite endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure events, but did not meet the secondary endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death. Cytokinetics subsequently regained global rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil when Amgen and Servier elected to terminate their collaboration agreement effective, May 2021. Following the Phase 3 results and termination of the collaboration, we wrote off the full value of our financial royalty asset given the uncertainty around the future of omecamtiv mecarbil.\nIn February 2022, Cytokinetics announced that FDA has accepted and filed the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for omecamtiv mecarbil. The FDA assigned the NDA a standard review with a PDUFA target action date of November 30, 2022. The FDA also indicated that it is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The submission is supported by GALACTIC-HF, which demonstrated a positive effect on the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who were receiving standard of care plus omecamtiv mecarbil.\n\u2022Otilimab. GlaxoSmithKline has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the contRast trials in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2022.\n\u2022Pelabresib: In December 2021, MorphoSys presented the latest data from the Phase 2 MANIFEST study evaluating pelabresib in the treatment of myelofibrosis. As of September 10, 2021, the data cut-off, a total of 84 JAK inhibtor-naive patients were enrolled and received the first-line combination of pelabresib and ruxolitinib. The data showed 68% (n=57) of patients treated with the combination achieved a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume (SVR35) from baseline at week 24 and 60% (n=47) maintained SVR35 at week 48. Most patients also saw their symptoms reduced, with 56% (n=46) achieving greater than or equal to 50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline at week 24.\n\u2022PT027. In September 2021, AstraZeneca and Avillion announced positive results from MANDALA and DENALI, two Phase 3 trials evaluating PT027 (albuterol/budesonide) in patients with asthma. PT027 is a potential first-in-class inhaled, fixed-dose combination of albuterol, a short-acting beta2-agonist, and budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid. In MANDALA, PT027 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations compared to albuterol, when used as a rescue medicine in response to symptoms. In DENALI, PT027 showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in one second, compared to the individual components albuterol and budesonide, and compared to placebo. The safety and tolerability of PT027 in both trials was consistent with the known profiles of the components. AstraZeneca has indicated PT027 regulatory submissions will occur in the first half of 2022.\n\u2022Zavegepant. In December 2019, Biohaven announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine.\nIn March 2021, Biohaven announced that it enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant for the preventive treatment of migraine. Accordingly, per the agreement with Biohaven announced in August 2020, Royalty Pharma paid $100 million to Biohaven for the achievement of this milestone, bringing the total zavegepant funding to $250 million.\nIn December 2021, Biohaven announced positive topline results from the second pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The Phase 3 study achieved its co-primary regulatory endpoints of pain freedom and freedom of most bothersome symptom at 2 hours and showed broad efficacy by demonstrating statistically significant superiority to placebo across a total of 15 prespecified primary and secondary outcome measures. Biohaven plans to file an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first quarter of 2022 and other countries thereafter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on a non-GAAP basis. There is no direct correlation between income from financial royalty assets and royalty receipts due to the nature of the accounting methodology applied for financial royalty assets. Further, income from financial royalty assets and the provision for changes in expected cash flows related to these financial royalty assets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result, management places importance on royalty receipts as they are predictable and we use them as a measure of our operating performance. Refer to section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures and reconciliations from the most directly GAAP comparable measures of Net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts is a measure calculated with inputs directly from the Statement of Cash Flows and includes (1) royalty receipts by product: (i) Cash collections from royalty assets (financial assets and intangible assets), (ii) Other royalty cash collections, (iii) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates, plus (2) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities; less (3) Distributions to non-controlling interest, which represents contractual distributions of royalty receipts and proceeds from available for sale debt securities to our historical non-controlling interest attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by certain legacy investors and to the non-controlling interest that was created as a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions in February 2020 related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI. Adjusted Cash Receipts is most directly comparable to the GAAP measure of Net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are similar non-GAAP liquidity measures that are both most closely comparable to the GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA is important to our lenders and is defined under the Credit Agreement as Adjusted Cash Receipts less Payments for operating and professional costs. Payments for operating and professional costs are comprised of Payments for operating and professional costs and Payments for rebates from the Statement of Cash Flows.\nAdjusted Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) Ongoing development-stage funding payments, (2) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (3) Other (including Derivative collateral posted, net of Derivative collateral received, and Termination payments on derivative instruments) and (4) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates, plus (1) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, all directly reconcilable to the Statement of Cash Flows.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, as derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\nThe following is a discussion of our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For a discussion comparing our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe table below includes the royalty receipts and non-GAAP financial results for the years ended

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount also includes a payment from Biohaven in respect of an expired option to exercise additional funding of the Biohaven Series A Preferred Shares which is presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows.\n(5) Other products primarily include royalties on the following products: Bosulif (a product co-developed by our joint venture investee, Avillion, for which receipts are presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows), Lexiscan, Soliqua, Nesina, Cimzia, Letairis, Entyvio, Myozyme, Mircera and Lyrica. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a one-time milestone payment of $45.0 million that we received on Soliqua. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a one-time $21.3 million distribution from Avillion in respect of the Merck KGaA Asset for which the receipt is presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates in both the operating and investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Date, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted Cash Receipts increased by $328.5 million to $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, including royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise that we acquired in October 2020, fixed payments from Biohaven on the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and new assets acquired subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting the increase in royalty receipts was a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, Lyrica and Letairis. Additionally, we received one-time payments of $45.0 million related to a commercial milestone for Soliqua and $21.3 million from Avillion II in connection with the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in Adjusted Cash Receipts was further driven by a decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest, primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nBelow we discuss the key drivers of royalty receipts.\nRoyalty Receipts\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise - Royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, which includes Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio, which are marketed by Vertex for patients with certain mutations causing cystic fibrosis, increased by $150.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the performance of Trikafta in the United States, including its rapid uptake in children 6 through 11 years old and the launch of Kaftrio in Europe. The year ended December 31, 2021 also benefited from a clawback adjustment related to Vertex's agreement with French authorities around reimbursement for Orkambi, which had reduced royalty receipts in the three months ended March 31, 2020 by approximately $41 million (to reflect a true-up in prior periods where we collected royalties on sales in France at a higher selling price). Following our acquisition of the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the three months ended December 31, 2020, we are entitled to all royalty receipts on annual worldwide net sales above $5.8 billion. We received royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Tysabri - Royalty receipts from Tysabri, which is marketed by Biogen for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, increased by $23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued patient growth.\n\u2022Imbruvica - Royalty receipts from Imbruvica, which is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease, increased by $30.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued global penetration in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by modest market share losses in the United States, lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of COVID-19 inventory stocking.\n\u2022Promacta - Royalty receipts from Promacta, which is marketed by Novartis for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, increased by $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This growth was primarily driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia in the United States.\n\u2022Xtandi - Royalty receipts from Xtandi, which is marketed by Pfizer and Astellas for the treatment of prostate cancer, increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by demand across various prostate cancer indications.\n\u2022Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs - Royalty receipts from the DPP-IVs for type 2 diabetes, which includes Januvia and Janumet, both marketed by Merck & Co., increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT - Royalty receipts from Nurtec ODT, marketed by Biohaven and Pfizer for the acute treatment of migraine, were $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, as a result of the approval of Nurtec ODT in February 2020, we received $62.5 million in fixed payments from Biohaven in the year ended December 31, 2021, which represent the first four of 16 consecutive quarterly payments to be received from Biohaven relating to the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares.\n\u2022Tremfya - Royalty receipts from Tremfya, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson, were $35.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Tremfya royalty in July 2021.\n\u2022Cabometyx/Cometriq - Royalty receipts from Cabometyx/Cometriq, which is marketed by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda, were $33.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Cabometyx/Cometriq royalty in March 2021.\n\u2022HIV franchise - Royalty receipts from the HIV franchise, which is based on products marketed by Gilead that contain emtricitabine, including Biktarvy, Genvoya and Truvada, among others, decreased by $215.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven by the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise in 2021.\nDistributions to Non-Controlling Interest\nDistributions to non-controlling interest decreased by $64.3 million to $479.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which positively impacted Adjusted Cash Receipts. The decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest is primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these decreases was a distribution to non-controlling interest related to the one-time milestone payment we received on Soliqua in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $323.7 million to $1.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the factors noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP).\u201d Payments for operating and professional costs, the only adjustment between Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted EBITDA, increased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher Operating and Personnel Payments under the terms of our Management Agreement offset by a decrease in non-recurring professional services fees, restructuring fees and refinancing fees incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and the IPO.\nAdjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nAdjusted Cash Flow increased by $283.7 million to $1.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily for the same reasons noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).\u201d The adjustments between Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\u201d increased by $39.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 30, 2020. The increase was driven by a $31.8 million increase in net interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a shift to semi-annual interest payments on the 2020 Notes and a $16.1 million one-time payment related to the settlement of treasury rate lock contracts in connection with the 2021 Notes issuance. This increase was partially offset by lower ongoing development-stage funding requirements under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi and lower funding requirements by the Avillion entities in 2021 following the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in 2020.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nAdjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures presented as supplemental measures to our GAAP financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. In each case, because our operating performance is a function of our liquidity, the non-GAAP measures used by management are presented and defined as supplemental liquidity measures. We caution readers that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of Adjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies. Not all companies and analysts calculate the non-GAAP measures we use in the same manner. We compensate for these limitations by using non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by presenting the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures, in each case being Net cash provided by operating activities.\nWe believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow provide meaningful information about our operating performance because the business is heavily reliant on its ability to generate consistent cash flows and these measures reflect the core cash collections and cash charges comprising our operating results. Management strongly believes that our significant operating cash flow is one of the attributes that attracts potential investors to our business.\nIn addition, we believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow help identify underlying trends in the business and permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company, including planning and forecasting for future periods. Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, voluntary debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures help management, the audit committee and investors evaluate our ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within the Company's credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the assessment of our liquidity.\nManagement uses Adjusted Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate cash and performance of the business and to evaluate the Company's performance as compared to its peer group. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income measures used by many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, even though each company may customize its own calculation and therefore one company's metric may not be directly comparable to another's. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Cash Flow, are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, in each case being Net cash provided by operating activities below.\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Receipts, we start with the GAAP line item, Net cash provided by operating activities, and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily the redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), which are cash inflows that management believes are derived from royalties and form part of our core business strategy, (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments, (5) Payments for operating and professional costs, (6) Payments for rebates and (7) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest, which represents distributions to our historical non-controlling interest attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by certain legacy investors and to a new non-controlling interest that was created as a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions in February 2020 related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net, both of which are excluded when management assesses its operating performance through cash collections, or, Adjusted Cash Receipts.\nTo arrive at Adjusted EBITDA, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments and (5) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net.\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Flow, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates classified as Cash used in investing activities, (3) Upfront development-stage funding payments and (4) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates. This is intended to present an Adjusted Cash Flow measure that is representative of cash generated from the broader business strategy of acquiring royalty-generating assets that are available for reinvestment and for discretionary purposes.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,017,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,034,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (1), (2) </td> <td>62,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates -

New investments provide a source of growth for our royalty receipts, supplementing growth within our existing portfolio and offsetting declines for products in our portfolio that have lost market exclusivity. We evaluate an array of royalty acquisition opportunities on a continuous basis and expect to continue to make acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business. Our team has established a strong track record of identifying, evaluating and investing in royalties tied to leading products across therapeutic areas and treatment modalities. We invest in approved products and development-stage product candidates that have generated robust proof of concept data. We invest in these therapies through the purchase of royalties, by making hybrid investments and by acquiring businesses with significant existing royalty assets or the potential for the creation of such assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested $2.7 billion in royalties and related assets across five separate transactions. While volatility exists in the quantum of our new acquisitions on a year-to-year basis due to the unpredictable timing of new investment opportunities, we have consistently deployed significant amounts of cash when measured over multi-year periods. Our approach is rooted in a highly disciplined evaluation process that is not dictated by a minimum annual investment threshold.\nIncluded below is a table of investment activity over each of the last ten years based on the type of investment at the acquisition date. Amounts presented in the table below reflect cash paid at the acquisition date; any associated contractual payments are reflected in the period in which cash was paid.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approved / marketed royalties </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,018,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,819,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,404,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,848,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,200,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>510,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development-stage royalties (1) (2) </td> <td>778,633 </td> <td> </td> <td>830,713 </td> <td> </td> <td>894,469 </td> <td> </td> <td>445,699 </td> <td> </td> <td>569,592 </td> <td> </td> <td>220,093 </td> <td> </td> <td>99,242 </td> <td> </td> <td>120,285 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428,530 </td> <td> </td> <td>391,287 </td> <td> </td> <td>786,417 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,796,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,650,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,298,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,294,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>839,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,420,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,296,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,896,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>901,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>910,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Development stage royalties include: direct R&D funding arrangements and funding arrangements executed through our joint venture partnership with the Avillion Entities, investments in development-stage product candidates, and investments in securities primarily made in connection with acquisitions of royalties on development stage products from the seller.\n(2) In 2014, acquisitions of development-stage royalties included $3.3 billion for the acquisition of royalties on the cystic fibrosis franchise. At the time of the investment, Kalydeco was the only approved product in the franchise, while the vast majority of the value of our investment was tied to development-stage product candidates.\nSummary of royalty acquisition activity\n\u2022In January 2022, we acquired a royalty interest in aficamten from Cytokinetics, Incorporated ( Cytokinetics\u201d) for $150.0 million comprised of an upfront payment of $50 million and two additional $50 million payments, conditional upon the initiation of potential pivotal clinical trials for oHCM and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Additionally, we will provide Cytokinetics long-term capital of up to $300 million ( Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding\u201d) to support potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and further development of aficamten. The Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding is available in five tranches, including an initial tranche of $50 million funded upon closing and four additional tranches in the aggregate amount of $250 million to be funded upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and clinical development milestones.\n\u2022In November 2021, we acquired incremental royalty interests in BCX9930 and Orladeyo (berotralstat) from BioCryst for an upfront cash payment of $150 million. Additionally, we paid $50 million to purchase 3,846 thousand shares of common stock in BioCryst, which was calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of BioCryst common stock over a period preceding the closing of the transaction. The funds from this transaction will enable further advancement of BCX9930 and support additional investment in the global launch of Orladeyo (berotralstat).\n\u2022In June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys AG ( MorphoSys\u201d) to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Constellation\u201d), which closed on July 15, 2021. We agreed to provide up to $2.025 billion of funding to MorphoSys, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.425 billion, additional milestone payments of up to $150 million, up to $350 million of capital ( Development Funding Bonds\u201d), which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In connection with the closing of MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, we purchased 1,337,552 ordinary shares of MorphoSys for $100 million at a price of \u20ac63.35 per ordinary share, based on the average trading price of the ordinary shares over a period preceding the closing of the acquisition.\n\u2022In April 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in Oxlumo from Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront cash payment of $180 million and up to $60 million in contingent sales-based milestone payments. Oxlumo, which has been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1, is marketed by Alnylam.\n\u2022In March 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in the cabozantinib products Cabometyx and Cometriq from GSK for an upfront payment of $342 million and up to $50 million in additional payments contingent on the achievement of regulatory approvals of cabozantinib for prostate cancer and lung cancer in the United States and Europe.\n\u2022In January 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in seltorexant from Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. for an upfront payment of $60 million and up to $95 million in additional milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. Seltorexant is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with insomnia symptoms by Johnson & Johnson.\n\u2022In December 2020, we acquired royalty interests from BioCryst on (1) Orladeyo (berotralstat) to support the launch of the product in hereditary angioedema (HAE) and (2) its development stage Factor D inhibitor BCX9930 in exchange for an upfront cash payment of $125 million.\n\u2022In October 2020, we acquired the residual royalty interest in Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise owned by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The agreement includes an upfront payment of $575 million and a potential milestone payment of $75 million.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into an expanded agreement with Biohaven for up to $450 million to fund the development of zavegepant and the commercialization of Nurtec ODT. Biohaven received an upfront payment of $150 million at closing and received an additional $100 million payment in March 2021 upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program. We will receive a royalty on Nurtec ODT and zavegepant and success-based milestone payments based on zavegepant regulatory approvals. We are also committed to provide further support for the ongoing launch of Nurtec ODT through the purchase of committed, non-contingent Commercial Launch Preferred Equity (defined below) for a total of $200 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In return, Biohaven will pay a series of equal fixed payments from the three months ended March 31, 2025 through the three months ended December 31, 2030.\n\u2022In July 2020, we acquired a royalty on risdiplam, a development-stage product for the treatment of Types 1, 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) from PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $650 million. Evrysdi (risdiplam) was subsequently approved by the FDA in August 2020, representing the first, oral treatment approved for infants, children and adults with all SMA types.\n\u2022In June 2020, we acquired a royalty on (1) Prevymis, an approved product to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in stem cell transplants, from AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH in exchange for an upfront payment of $220 million and (2) IDHIFA, an approved product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation, from Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $255 million.\n\u2022In March 2020, we acquired a royalty on Entyvio, an approved product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, from The General Hospital Corporation in exchange for an upfront payment of $86.6 million.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay $320 million to acquire from Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. a royalty on the European sales of Crysvita, an approved product for the treatment of x-linked hypophosphatemia, a rare genetic orphan disease that has a profound impact on bone development in adults and children, subject to certain caps.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay up to $330 million to purchase a royalty owned by Eisai, on future worldwide sales outside Japan of Tazverik (tazemetostat), a novel targeted therapy in late-stage clinical development with the potential to be approved in several cancer indications. We acquired a portion Eisai's future worldwide royalties on net sales by Epizyme of Tazverik outside Japan, for an upfront payment of $110 million plus up to an additional $220 million for the remainder of the royalty upon FDA approval of Tazverik for certain indications. The FDA approved Tazverik in January 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma which triggered our obligation to fund the second $110 million tranche in November 2020. In June 2020, the FDA approval of additional indications triggered our recognition of a liability for the final tranche of $110.0 million, which was paid in November 2021.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we made a $100 million investment in Epizyme. In exchange for an upfront payment of $100 million, we received (1) shares of Epizyme common stock, (2) a warrant to purchase an additional 2.5 million shares of Epizyme common stock at $20 per share over a three-year term and (3) Epizyme's royalty on sales of Tazverik in Japan payable by Eisai. We also lowered Epizyme's royalty on Tazverik above certain sales thresholds and granted Epizyme an 18-month put option to sell an additional $50 million of its common stock to RPIFT at then-prevailing prices, not to exceed $20 per share. Epizyme exercised its put option on December 30, 2019, which resulted in Epizyme issuing RPIFT 2.5 million shares on settlement in February 2020.\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we entered into a preferred share purchase agreement with Biohaven through which we purchased $125 million in Series A Preferred Shares, providing us with a fixed return on redemption of two times our investment on FDA approval of Biohaven's pipeline product, Nurtec ODT, for migraine treatment. The FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults in February 2020.\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we acquired the following: (1) a royalty on Promacta, an approved product for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, from Ligand Pharmaceuticals in exchange for an upfront payment of $827 million, (2) a royalty on Lilly's Emgality, an approved product for the treatment of migraine, from Atlas Ventures and Orbimed for $260 million and (3) a royalty on Johnson & Johnson's Erleada, an approved product for the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Regents of the University of California for $105.4 million and potential future milestones.\nAdditionally, in April 2021, we entered into an agreement with MSCI Inc. ( MSCI\u201d), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services where we will assist MSCI to design a classification framework and index methodologies which will expand MSCI's thematic index suite with the launch of new indexes. In return, we will receive a portion of MSCI's revenues from those indexes. The financial statement impact associated with this transaction was not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in Net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that our existing capital resources, cash provided by operating activities and our Revolving Credit Facility will continue to allow us to meet our operating and working capital requirements, to fund planned strategic acquisitions and R&D funding arrangements, and to meet our debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. We have historically operated at a low level of fixed operating costs. Our primary cash operating expenses, other than R&D funding commitments, include interest expense, our Operating and Personnel Payments, and legal and professional fees.\nWe have access to substantial sources of funds in the capital markets and we may, from time to time, seek additional capital through a combination of additional debt or equity financings. In June 2020, we completed our IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $86.3 million. In February 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we repaid outstanding debt held by RPIFT in full and issued new long-term debt at RPI Intermediate FT. In September 2020, we repaid in full our senior secured credit facilities entered into in February 2020 using the proceeds of the 2020 Notes in addition to cash on hand. In July 2021, we issued an additional $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have a Revolving Credit Facility which provides for borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion that remains undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total long-term debt outstanding of $7.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.\nWe have historically funded our acquisition program through free cash flow, equity contributions and debt. Our low operating costs coupled with a lack of capital expenditures and low taxes have contributed to our strong financial profile, resulting in high operating leverage and high conversion of our Adjusted Cash Receipts to Adjusted Cash Flow. We expect to continue funding our current and planned operating costs (excluding acquisitions) principally through our cash flow from operations and our acquisition program through cash flow and issuances of equity and debt. In the past, we have supplemented our available cash and cash equivalents on hand with attractive debt capital to fund certain strategic acquisitions.\nOur ability to satisfy our working capital needs, debt service and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants under our financing agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nCash flows\nThe following table and analysis of cash flow changes presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,017,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,034,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,093) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,870,280) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,759,320) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>889,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,487,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,102,060) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes\nOperating activities\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase of $187.4 million in upfront R&D funding and an increase of $27.2 million in interest paid. The increase was driven by upfront R&D funding payments of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product acquired in connection with our expanded funding agreement with BioCryst and $90.0 million related royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys. The increase in interest paid was primarily due to the shift from quarterly to semi-annual interest payments with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, for which we did not make any interest payments on the 2020 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in cash collections from financial royalty assets of $193.9 million.\nInvesting activities\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $889.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the overall net cash provided by marketable securities which was partially offset by a decrease of $268.9 million in proceeds from equity securities. We received $116.0 million related to the sale of our Cytokinetics common stock and a portion of our Biohaven common shares in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $384.8 million received from the full redemption of our investment in Immunomedics common stock upon its acquisition by Gilead in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was further offset by an increase of $85.1 million in purchases of equity securities. We purchased $135.1 million of equity securities in Morphosys and BioCryst in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to purchases of equity securities of $50.0 million related to the exercise of the Epizyme put option in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFinancing activities\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the $1.9 billion net proceeds received from our IPO in June 2020. Offsetting the decreases in cash provided by financing activities were net proceeds of $1.3 billion from issuance of 2021 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the net proceeds of $727.9 million related to the debt refinancings in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSources of Capital\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion and $581.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.0 billion and $983.3 million, respectively. We intend to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash and cash equivalents, sales of marketable securities, future cash flows from operations or the issuance of additional debt. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the sales of the underlying pharmaceutical products in which we hold royalties, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. Currently, we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives.\nBorrowings\nOur borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Date of Issuance </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Notes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 0.75% (issued at 99.322% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2023 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 1.20% (issued at 98.875% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2025 </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 1.75% (issued at 98.284% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2027 </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 2.20% (issued at 97.760% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2030 </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$600,000, 2.15% (issued at 98.263% of par) </td> <td>7/2021 </td> <td>9/2031 </td> <td>600,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 3.30% (issued at 95.556% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2040 </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1,000,000, 3.55% (issued at 95.306% of par) </td> <td>9/2020 </td> <td>9/2050 </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$700,000, 3.35% (issued at 97.565% of par) </td> <td>7/2021 </td> <td>9/2051 </td> <td>700,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total senior unsecured debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(203,930) </td> <td> </td> <td>(183,416) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,096,070 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,816,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn July 26, 2021, we issued $1.3 billion of the 2021 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.80% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $36.4 million, paid semi-annually. On September 2, 2020, we issued $6.0 billion of the 2020 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.125% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $127.5 million, paid semi-annually. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes offering, together with available cash on hand, to repay in full the senior secured credit facilities. Indentures governing the Notes contain certain covenants, which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2021.\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn September 15, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the credit agreement that our subsidiary, RP Holdings, as borrower, entered into on September 18, 2020, which provided for a five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 15, 2026. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2021.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOn February 11, 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and using funds contributed by RPI Intermediate FT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships, RPIFT repaid its outstanding debt and accrued interest, and terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps. RPI Intermediate FT, as borrower, entered into a term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto from time to time and the other parties thereto. In September 2020, we repaid in full the outstanding principal amounts of term loans under the senior secured credit facilities with the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes and available cash on hand.\nRPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities\nThe RPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities were repaid in full in February 2020 and new senior secured credit facilities were issued by RPI Intermediate FT in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions.\nUses of Capital\nAcquisitions of royalties\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners. We classify our product royalty acquisitions by the following structures:\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\n\u2022Synthetic / Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product for which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\n\u2022R&D Funding - We have historically funded ongoing R&D, typically for large biopharmaceutical companies, in exchange for future royalties and/or milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved. We have also made upfront R&D payments to biotechnology companies to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nDistributions to Shareholders/Unitholders\nWe paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $285.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We do not have a legal obligation to pay a quarterly dividend or dividends at any specified rate or at all.\nWe made distributions of $285.4 million to shareholders/unitholders prior to the IPO in June 2020. We paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $112.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 subsequent to the IPO.\nWe made distributions of $739.3 million to unitholders in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther Funding Arrangements\nIn June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, which closed on July 15, 2021. As part of the partnership, we agreed to provide MorphoSys up to $350 million of Development Funding Bonds, which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In return, we expect to receive a return of 2.2 times the amount funded on the Development Funding Bonds payable on a quarterly basis over nine years, with the first payment beginning two years after the funding. As of December 31, 2021, MorphoSys has not drawn any amount under the Development Funding Bonds.\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Purchase Agreement ( Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Agreement\u201d) with Biohaven where we committed to acquire 3,992 shares of Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares at a price of $50,100 per preferred share (the Commercial Launch Preferred Equity\u201d), for a total of $200.0 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we began purchasing the Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares and have a remaining commitment of $129.6 million under our Commercial Launch Preferred Equity as of December 31, 2021.\nWe have other funding arrangements where we are contractually obligated to fund R&D activities performed by our development partners and to provide additional capital related to our equity method investment in the Avillion entities. As our committed capital requirements are based on phases of development, the completion of which is highly uncertain, only the capital required to fund the current stage of development under such funding arrangements is considered committed capital requirements which approximate $41.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\nWe also have certain milestone payments that are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. As such, these contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a $100.0 million payment to Biohaven related to a development milestone that was achieved upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program.\nDebt service\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future principal and interest payments under our Notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Payments </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Payments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>5,300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,070,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,858,534 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $203.9 million as of December 31, 2021, which are amortized through interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt obligations.\nOperating and Personnel Payments\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay quarterly Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the Adjusted Cash Receipts for such quarter and 0.25% of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. Because the Operating and Personnel Payments is determined based on Adjusted Cash Receipts, the amounts are fixed. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nOur obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RP Holdings, a non-wholly owned subsidiary (the Guarantor Subsidiary\u201d). Our remaining subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d) do not guarantee the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, Royalty Pharma plc and the Guarantor Subsidiary each fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee the payment of interest, principal and premium, if any, on the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the par value and carrying value of the total outstanding and guaranteed Notes was $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\nThe following financial information presents summarized combined balance sheet financial information as of December 31, 2021, and summarized combined statement of operations information for the year ended December 31, 2021 for Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings. All intercompany balances and transactions between Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings are eliminated in the presentation of the combined financial statements. RP Holdings' most significant asset is its investment in operating subsidiaries, which has been eliminated in the table below to exclude investments in Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries hold the majority of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and financial royalty assets.

Certain of these policies are considered critical as they have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of income and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur most critical accounting policies relate to our financial royalty assets and the full descriptions can be found in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of our financial royalty assets at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method. The application of the prospective approach to calculate interest income from our financial royalty assets requires management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events.\nWe evaluate financial royalty assets for impairment on an individual basis by comparing the effective interest rate at each reporting date to that of the prior period. If the effective interest rate for the current period is lower than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected), management records a provision for the change in expected cash flows. The provision is measured as the difference between the financial royalty asset's amortized cost basis and the net present value of the expected future cash flows, calculated based on the prior period's effective interest rate. The amount recognized as provision expense increases the financial royalty asset's cumulative allowance, which reduces the net carrying value of the financial royalty asset.\nFactors Impacting Expected Future Cash Flows\nThe amounts and timing of forecasted expected future cash flows are largely influenced by sell-side equity research analyst coverage, commercial performance of the product and the royalty duration.\n\u2022Analyst coverage. Forecasts of expected future cash flows are developed from sales projections of the underlying biopharmaceutical products as published in sell-side equity research analyst reports. In projecting future cash flows, our policy is to rely on sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for a product to derive annual sales projections for each financial royalty asset over the periods for which we are entitled to royalties or milestones. When royalty-bearing biopharmaceutical products have no coverage, limited sell-side equity research analyst coverage or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of the royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, management uses reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, market trends and management's own expertise.\n\u2022Commercial performance. The approval of a product for use in new indications can extend the date through which we are entitled to royalties or milestones on that product. For certain financial royalty assets, such as the cystic fibrosis franchise, we are entitled to royalties on approved combination products and may be entitled to royalties on future combination products, which, once approved, create new cash flow streams which were not initially contemplated and whose sales were previously not reflected in expected future cash flows. We generally do not recognize income from, or forecast sales for, unapproved products or indications. If a product is removed from all or a portion of a market, subsequent sell-side equity research analysts' forecasts will reflect the expected drop in sales. Both the new cash flow streams and the cessation of cash flow streams related to a product's performance in the market over the royalty term can materially affect our forecast of expected future cash flows.\n\u2022Royalty duration. The duration of a financial royalty asset can be based on a number of factors, such as regulatory and marketing approval dates, patent expiration dates, the number of years from first commercial sale, the first date of manufacture of the patent-protected product, strength of patent protection, the entry of generics or a contractual date arising from litigation, which are all impacted by the time in the product's life cycle at which we acquire the financial royalty asset. Royalty duration varies by geography as United States, European Union and other jurisdictions may be subject to different country-specific patent protection terms or exclusivity based on contractual terms. Products may be covered by a number of patents and, for products whose royalty term is linked to the existence of valid patents, management is required to make judgments about the patent providing the strongest patent protection to align the period over which management forecasts expected future cash flows to the royalty term.\nSignificant Assumptions Applied in Developing Forecasted Expected Future Cash Flows\nThe most significant assumptions used in forecasting the expected future cash flows for our royalties and requiring management's judgement include (1) estimates of the duration of the royalty, which includes consideration of the strength of patent protection and anticipated entry of generics, and (2) sales trends and product growth rates in outer years of the royalty term, which are primarily based on statistical models.\nThe royalty duration is important for purposes of accurately measuring interest income over the life of a financial royalty asset. In making assumptions around the royalty duration for terms that are not contractually fixed, management considers the strength of existing patent protection, expected entry of generics, geographical exclusivity periods and potential patent term extensions tied to the underlying product. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing for the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations.\nWhen royalty-bearing pharmaceutical products have limited or no coverage by sell-side equity research analysts, or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of our royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, we generally incorporate a statistical curve developed using historical sales data and available consensus sales projections to forecast product sales over the remaining life of the product. In cases where the statistical curve is not used, we use reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, publicly available information for the marketer, industry data and market trends and our own expertise.\nEven though we believe interest income from financial royalty assets and the associated non-cash provision for changes in future cash flows are not indicative of our near-term financial performance and should not be used as a source for predicting future income or growth trends, changes in the aforementioned assumptions could result in a material impact to our financial statements. A shortened royalty term can result in a reduction in interest income, significant reductions in total royalty payments over time compared to expectations or a permanent impairment. If the effective interest rate is lower for the current period than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected) this would result in the immediate recognition of non-cash provision expense even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. Changes in sell-side equity research analyst consensus sales forecasts directly impact future interest income and recognition of any provision income or expense in a similar manner.\nBelow is a summary of the sensitivity of our current year results in relation to the royalty duration for our top three financial royalty assets based on net carrying value as of December 31, 2021. Because these are long-dated financial royalty assets, we have assumed a change of two years in the estimated duration to sensitize the financial statement impact. The effect of a change in estimated duration is the factor that would have the most significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations. There have not been any significant changes to the estimated duration of expected future cash flows for our top three financial royalty assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, with the exception of the cystic fibrosis franchise due to the FDA approval of Trikafta in 2019, which extended the expected duration at that time.\nIf the duration of these financial royalty assets were extended by two years by assuming the statistically projected growth trends continue and all other royalty terms and assumptions remain unchanged, any impact to interest income would not be reflected until the subsequent period and is therefore not disclosed below. However, an extended duration for a financial royalty asset could result in the reduction of any cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows, which would be recognized in the current period as provision income and is reflected in the table below for these top three financial royalty assets. If the duration for these financial royalty assets were shortened by two years by eliminating the estimated expected future cash flows for the final two years while keeping all other royalty terms and assumptions unchanged, we would recognize immediate incremental provision expense in the current period as a result of applying the prospective method of the effective interest rate methodology. The disclosure of the duration sensitivity below does not include any consideration of the related allowance for current expected credit losses. The impact of these sensitivity assumptions is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Estimated Royalty Duration (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Duration Assumption Applied </td> <td> </td> <td>Provision (Income)/Expense for Changes in Expected Cash Flows </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cystic fibrosis franchise </td> <td>2037 (b) </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 2 years </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48,636) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261,265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tysabri </td> <td>(c) </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 2 years </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,617) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,098 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Imbruvica </td> <td>2027-2032 </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 2 years </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(99,398) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,129 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Dates shown represent our estimates as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K of when a royalty will substantially end, which may depend on clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, contractual terms, commercial developments, our estimates of patent expiration dates (which may include estimated patent term extensions) or other factors and may vary by geography.

In any period, we will recognize provision income or expense as a result of the following factors: (1) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (2) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (3) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (4) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments.\n\u2022Royalty duration.

31, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn September 15, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the credit agreement that our subsidiary, RP Holdings, as borrower, entered into on September 18, 2020, which provided for a five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 15, 2026.

The net income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the IPO in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the full period of net income in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income attributable to Continuing Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to RP Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was further driven by the ongoing exchanges in 2021 by investors in the Continuing Investors Partnerships who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests for our Class A ordinary shares, resulting in a decline in the Continuing Investors Partnerships' ownership of RP Holdings.\nFollowing management's determination that a high degree of common ownership exists in Royalty Pharma both before and after the Exchange Date, Royalty Pharma recognized Old RPI's assets and liabilities at the carrying value reflected on Old RPI's balance sheet as of the Exchange Date.

Biohaven plans to file an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first quarter of 2022 and other countries thereafter.\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the Adjusted Cash Receipts for each quarter and 0.25% of the value of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. The operating and personnel payments for Old RPI, an obligation of the Legacy Investors Partnerships as a non-controlling interest in Old RPI and for which the expense is reflected in our consolidated net income, are payable in equal quarterly installments and calculated as the greater of $1 million per quarter and 0.3125% of royalties from Royalty Investments (as defined in the limited partnership agreements of the Legacy Investors Partnerships) during the previous twelve calendar months.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced detailed results from the expanded Cohort 6 of the Phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic CRPC, which included patients with metastatic CRPC who had been previously treated with novel hormone therapies enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate used along with prednisone. Following discussions with FDA, Exelixis will not pursue a regulatory submission for the combination regimen based on cohort 6 of COSMIC-021.

with the financial covenants under our financing agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe following is a discussion of our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For a discussion comparing our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Analyst coverage. Forecasts of expected future cash flows are developed from sales projections of the underlying biopharmaceutical products as published in sell-side equity research analyst reports. In projecting future cash flows, our policy is to rely on sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for a product to derive annual sales projections for each financial royalty asset over the periods for which we are entitled to royalties or milestones. When royalty-bearing biopharmaceutical products have no coverage, limited sell-side equity research analyst coverage or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of the royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, management uses reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, market trends and management's own expertise.\nWe made distributions of $285.4 million to shareholders/unitholders prior to the IPO in June 2020. We paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $112.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 subsequent to the IPO.\nTotal income and revenues\nOther royalty income\n\u2022Tysabri - Royalty receipts from Tysabri, which is marketed by Biogen for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, increased by $23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued patient growth.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\n\u2022In June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys AG ( MorphoSys\u201d) to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Constellation\u201d), which closed on July 15, 2021. We agreed to provide up to $2.025 billion of funding to MorphoSys, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.425 billion, additional milestone payments of up to $150 million, up to $350 million of capital ( Development Funding Bonds\u201d), which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In connection with the closing of MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, we purchased 1,337,552 ordinary shares of MorphoSys for $100 million at a price of \u20ac63.35 per ordinary share, based on the average trading price of the ordinary shares over a period preceding the closing of the acquisition.\n\nWe also have certain milestone payments that are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. As such, these contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a $100.0 million payment to Biohaven related to a development milestone that was achieved upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program.\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners. We classify our product royalty acquisitions by the following structures:\n\u2022In January 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in seltorexant from Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. for an upfront payment of $60 million and up to $95 million in additional milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. Seltorexant is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with insomnia symptoms by Johnson & Johnson.\n1. The first minority interest is attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the assets in Old RPI expire.\nOther expense/(income), net\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Flow, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates classified as Cash used in investing activities, (3) Upfront development-stage funding payments and (4) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates. This is intended to present an Adjusted Cash Flow measure that is representative of cash generated from the broader business strategy of acquiring royalty-generating assets that are available for reinvestment and for discretionary purposes.\nUpon the adoption on January 1, 2020 of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), we recorded a cumulative adjustment to Retained earnings of $192.7 million to recognize an allowance for current expected credit losses on our portfolio of financial royalty assets. The Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets reflects the activity for the period, primarily new financial royalty assets with limited protective rights and changes in the underlying cash flow forecasts used in the effective interest model to measure income from our financial royalty assets.\nWe classify our royalty acquisitions by the approval status of the therapy at the time of acquisition:\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on a non-GAAP basis. There is no direct correlation between income from financial royalty assets and royalty receipts due to the nature of the accounting methodology applied for financial royalty assets. Further, income from financial royalty assets and the provision for changes in expected cash flows related to these financial royalty assets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result, management places importance on royalty receipts as they are predictable and we use them as a measure of our operating performance. Refer to section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures and reconciliations from the most directly GAAP comparable measures of Net cash provided by operating activities.\nIn August 2021, Biogen announced results from Phase 3b NOVA study evaluation every six-week dosing with Tysabri intravenous administration in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Results show that every six-week Tysabri intravenous administration provides a high level of efficacy in controlling multiple sclerosis disease activity in patients who switched from the approved every four-week dosing regimen.\n\u2022In June 2020, we acquired a royalty on (1) Prevymis, an approved product to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in stem cell transplants, from AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH in exchange for an upfront payment of $220 million and (2) IDHIFA, an approved product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation, from Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $255 million.\nIn September 2021, Astellas Pharma and Pfizer announced that Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) reduced the risk of death by 34% compared to placebo plus ADT in the Phase 3 ARCHES study in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The primary results from the ARCHES trial were published in 2019.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in this manner requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both our reported assets and liabilities and our income and revenue and expenses. The most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of income derived from our financial royalty assets, including management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties and the expected duration of the financial royalty asset. Our cash flow forecasts are generated and updated each reporting period by manually compiling sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates for each of the products in which we own royalties. We then calculate our expected royalty cash flows using these consensus sales forecasts. In any given reporting period, any decline or increase in the expected future cash flows associated with a financial royalty asset is recognized in our income statement as non-cash provision expense or provision income, respectively.\n\u2022In March 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in the cabozantinib products Cabometyx and Cometriq from GSK for an upfront payment of $342 million and up to $50 million in additional payments contingent on the achievement of regulatory approvals of cabozantinib for prostate cancer and lung cancer in the United States and Europe.\nIn September 2020, Gilead and Immunomedics announced that Gilead would acquire Immunomedics for approximately $21 billion in cash. In 2018, we entered into a partnership with Immunomedics whereby we acquired a tiered sales-based royalty on Trodelvy for $175.0 million and acquired 4,373,178 shares of Immunomedics common stock for $75.0 million. Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics closed in October 2020, resulting in gross cash proceeds upon redemption of our Immunomedics common stock of approximately $385 million.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts increased by $328.5 million to $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, including royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise that we acquired in October 2020, fixed payments from Biohaven on the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and new assets acquired subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting the increase in royalty receipts was a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, Lyrica and Letairis. Additionally, we received one-time payments of $45.0 million related to a commercial milestone for Soliqua and $21.3 million from Avillion II in connection with the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in Adjusted Cash Receipts was further driven by a decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest, primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nIf the duration of these financial royalty assets were extended by two years by assuming the statistically projected growth trends continue and all other royalty terms and assumptions remain unchanged, any impact to interest income would not be reflected until the subsequent period and is therefore not disclosed below. However, an extended duration for a financial royalty asset could result in the reduction of any cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows, which would be recognized in the current period as provision income and is reflected in the table below for these top three financial royalty assets. If the duration for these financial royalty assets were shortened by two years by eliminating the estimated expected future cash flows for the final two years while keeping all other royalty terms and assumptions unchanged, we would recognize immediate incremental provision expense in the current period as a result of applying the prospective method of the effective interest rate methodology. The disclosure of the duration sensitivity below does not include any consideration of the related allowance for current expected credit losses. The impact of these sensitivity assumptions is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022PT027. In September 2021, AstraZeneca and Avillion announced positive results from MANDALA and DENALI, two Phase 3 trials evaluating PT027 (albuterol/budesonide) in patients with asthma. PT027 is a potential first-in-class inhaled, fixed-dose combination of albuterol, a short-acting beta2-agonist, and budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid. In MANDALA, PT027 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations compared to albuterol, when used as a rescue medicine in response to symptoms. In DENALI, PT027 showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in one second, compared to the individual components albuterol and budesonide, and compared to placebo. The safety and tolerability of PT027 in both trials was consistent with the known profiles of the components. AstraZeneca has indicated PT027 regulatory submissions will occur in the first half of 2022.\nWe believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow provide meaningful information about our operating performance because the business is heavily reliant on its ability to generate consistent cash flows and these measures reflect the core cash collections and cash charges comprising our operating results. Management strongly believes that our significant operating cash flow is one of the attributes that attracts potential investors to our business.\n(1) The cystic fibrosis franchise includes the following approved products: Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio.\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested $2.7 billion in royalties and related assets across five separate transactions. While volatility exists in the quantum of our new acquisitions on a year-to-year basis due to the unpredictable timing of new investment opportunities, we have consistently deployed significant amounts of cash when measured over multi-year periods. Our approach is rooted in a highly disciplined evaluation process that is not dictated by a minimum annual investment threshold.\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $203.9 million as of December 31, 2021, which are amortized through interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt obligations.\n\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes\nVariables affecting the recognition of interest income from financial royalty assets on individual products under the prospective effective interest method include any one of the following: (1) additional acquisitions, (2) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (3) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (4) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (5) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments. Our financial royalty assets are directly linked to sales of underlying pharmaceutical products whose life cycle typically peaks at a point in time, followed frequently by declining sales trends due to the entry of generic competition, resulting in natural declines in the asset balance and periodic interest income over the life of our royalties. The recognition of interest income from royalties requires management to make estimates and assumptions around many factors, including those impacting the variables noted above.\nDevelopment-Stage Product Candidates\nAdjusted Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) Ongoing development-stage funding payments, (2) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (3) Other (including Derivative collateral posted, net of Derivative collateral received, and Termination payments on derivative instruments) and (4) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates, plus (1) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, all directly reconcilable to the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT. In February 2020, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The FDA approval of Nurtec ODT triggered a redemption provision related to our investment in the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares, which entitles us to receive a fixed payment amount of $250.0 million payable in equal quarterly payments from March 31, 2021 through December 31, 2024.\n(2) In 2014, acquisitions of development-stage royalties included $3.3 billion for the acquisition of royalties on the cystic fibrosis franchise. At the time of the investment, Kalydeco was the only approved product in the franchise, while the vast majority of the value of our investment was tied to development-stage product candidates.\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of $193.2 million in upfront R&D funding and $6.9 million in ongoing R&D expenses, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi. The increase of R&D funding expense of $173.8 million, or 661.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by upfront R&D funding of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst in November 2021 and $90.0 million related to royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys in July 2021.\n\nThe RPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities were repaid in full in February 2020 and new senior secured credit facilities were issued by RPI Intermediate FT in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions.\nThe most significant assumptions used in forecasting the expected future cash flows for our royalties and requiring management's judgement include (1) estimates of the duration of the royalty, which includes consideration of the strength of patent protection and anticipated entry of generics, and (2) sales trends and product growth rates in outer years of the royalty term, which are primarily based on statistical models.\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\n\u2022In November 2021, we acquired incremental royalty interests in BCX9930 and Orladeyo (berotralstat) from BioCryst for an upfront cash payment of $150 million. Additionally, we paid $50 million to purchase 3,846 thousand shares of common stock in BioCryst, which was calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of BioCryst common stock over a period preceding the closing of the transaction. The funds from this transaction will enable further advancement of BCX9930 and support additional investment in the global launch of Orladeyo (berotralstat).\nWe have access to substantial sources of funds in the capital markets and we may, from time to time, seek additional capital through a combination of additional debt or equity financings. In June 2020, we completed our IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $86.3 million. In February 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we repaid outstanding debt held by RPIFT in full and issued new long-term debt at RPI Intermediate FT. In September 2020, we repaid in full our senior secured credit facilities entered into in February 2020 using the proceeds of the 2020 Notes in addition to cash on hand. In July 2021, we issued an additional $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have a Revolving Credit Facility which provides for borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion that remains undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total long-term debt outstanding of $7.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nOur portfolio consists of royalties on more than 35 marketed therapies and ten development-stage product candidates. The therapies in our portfolio address therapeutic areas such as rare disease, cancer, neurology, infectious disease, hematology and diabetes, and are delivered to patients across both primary and specialty care settings. The table below includes royalty receipts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in order of contributions to royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nBelow is a summary of the sensitivity of our current year results in relation to the royalty duration for our top three financial royalty assets based on net carrying value as of December 31, 2021. Because these are long-dated financial royalty assets, we have assumed a change of two years in the estimated duration to sensitize the financial statement impact. The effect of a change in estimated duration is the factor that would have the most significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations. There have not been any significant changes to the estimated duration of expected future cash flows for our top three financial royalty assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, with the exception of the cystic fibrosis franchise due to the FDA approval of Trikafta in 2019, which extended the expected duration at that time.\n\u2022movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\nIn April 2021, BioCryst announced that the EC approved Orladeyo for the prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older.\n(1) Development stage royalties include: direct R&D funding arrangements and funding arrangements executed through our joint venture partnership with the Avillion Entities, investments in development-stage product candidates, and investments in securities primarily made in connection with acquisitions of royalties on development stage products from the seller.\nIn June 2021, Gilead announced superior outcomes to standard of care in second-line treatment of metastatic TNBC in the Phase 3 ASCENT study. Trodelvy more than doubled overall survival as a second-line treatment in the new ASCENT subgroup analysis.\n\u2022Otilimab. GlaxoSmithKline has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the contRast trials in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2022.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nDistributions to Non-Controlling Interest\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on recently issued accounting standards.\n\u2022In March 2020, we acquired a royalty on Entyvio, an approved product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, from The General Hospital Corporation in exchange for an upfront payment of $86.6 million.\nIn December 2020, the FDA expanded the eligibility for Trikafta to include people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older with certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nFollowing our IPO, we operate and control the business affairs of Royalty Pharma Holdings Ltd, ( RP Holdings\u201d) through our controlling ownership of RP Holdings' Class A ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class A Interests\u201d) and RP Holdings' Class B ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class B Interests\u201d). We include RP Holdings and its subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements. RP Holdings is the sole owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, which is an Irish collective asset management entity formed to facilitate our Exchange Offer Transactions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nR&D funding expense consists of upfront and ongoing R&D payments we have made to counterparties to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates. Ongoing R&D payments are made as the related development-stage product candidates undergo clinical trials with our counterparties. These expenditures relate to the activities performed by our counterparties to develop and test new products, to test existing products for treatment in new indications, and to ensure product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.\nAdjusted Cash Flow increased by $283.7 million to $1.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily for the same reasons noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).\u201d The adjustments between Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\u201d increased by $39.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 30, 2020. The increase was driven by a $31.8 million increase in net interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a shift to semi-annual interest payments on the 2020 Notes and a $16.1 million one-time payment related to the settlement of treasury rate lock contracts in connection with the 2021 Notes issuance. This increase was partially offset by lower ongoing development-stage funding requirements under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi and lower funding requirements by the Avillion entities in 2021 following the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in 2020.\n\u2022Cabometyx. In January 2021, Exelixis announced that the FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a first-line treatment in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo. The approval was based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER trial, in which the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo significantly improved overall survival while doubling progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC.\nIn July 2021, we entered into an amended agreement with Avillion II to increase our investment from $105.0 million to $122.5 million over multiple years to fund a portion of the costs for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of Avillion II, which is a party to a co-development agreement with AstraZeneca to advance PT027 through a global clinical development program for the treatment of asthma in exchange for royalties, a series of success-based milestones, and other potential payments.\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nLegacy SLP Interest\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise - Royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, which includes Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio, which are marketed by Vertex for patients with certain mutations causing cystic fibrosis, increased by $150.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the performance of Trikafta in the United States, including its rapid uptake in children 6 through 11 years old and the launch of Kaftrio in Europe. The year ended December 31, 2021 also benefited from a clawback adjustment related to Vertex's agreement with French authorities around reimbursement for Orkambi, which had reduced royalty receipts in the three months ended March 31, 2020 by approximately $41 million (to reflect a true-up in prior periods where we collected royalties on sales in France at a higher selling price). Following our acquisition of the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the three months ended December 31, 2020, we are entitled to all royalty receipts on annual worldwide net sales above $5.8 billion. We received royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn December 2017, our equity method investee Avillion Financing I, LP ( Avillion I\u201d) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for Pfizer's Bosulif to expand its label into front-line chronic myeloid leukemia, which triggered a series of contractual fixed payments from Pfizer to Avillion I over a 10-year period, which we recognize through receipt of Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay $320 million to acquire from Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. a royalty on the European sales of Crysvita, an approved product for the treatment of x-linked hypophosphatemia, a rare genetic orphan disease that has a profound impact on bone development in adults and children, subject to certain caps.\nIn August 2021, Exelixis announced that their partners Takeda and Ono received approval in Japan for Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic RCC. Approval is based on the CheckMate -9ER trial of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo, which demonstrated superior overall survival and doubled mean progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib, with a favorable safety profile.\n\u2022Pelabresib: In December 2021, MorphoSys presented the latest data from the Phase 2 MANIFEST study evaluating pelabresib in the treatment of myelofibrosis. As of September 10, 2021, the data cut-off, a total of 84 JAK inhibtor-naive patients were enrolled and received the first-line combination of pelabresib and ruxolitinib. The data showed 68% (n=57) of patients treated with the combination achieved a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume (SVR35) from baseline at week 24 and 60% (n=47) maintained SVR35 at week 48. Most patients also saw their symptoms reduced, with 56% (n=46) achieving greater than or equal to 50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline at week 24.\nSubsequent to our IPO, net income attributable to non-controlling interest includes the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships and will include net income attributable to the Class C Special Interest held by EPA Holdings once certain conditions have been met. Future net income attributable to the non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares.\n*Represents less than 10%.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts (non-GAAP)\n\u2022In January 2022, we acquired a royalty interest in aficamten from Cytokinetics, Incorporated ( Cytokinetics\u201d) for $150.0 million comprised of an upfront payment of $50 million and two additional $50 million payments, conditional upon the initiation of potential pivotal clinical trials for oHCM and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Additionally, we will provide Cytokinetics long-term capital of up to $300 million ( Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding\u201d) to support potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and further development of aficamten. The Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding is available in five tranches, including an initial tranche of $50 million funded upon closing and four additional tranches in the aggregate amount of $250 million to be funded upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and clinical development milestones.\nIn February 2022, Cytokinetics announced that FDA has accepted and filed the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for omecamtiv mecarbil. The FDA assigned the NDA a standard review with a PDUFA target action date of November 30, 2022. The FDA also indicated that it is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The submission is supported by GALACTIC-HF, which demonstrated a positive effect on the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who were receiving standard of care plus omecamtiv mecarbil.\nWe recorded equity in losses of non-consolidated affiliates of $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates of 44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022HIV franchise - Royalty receipts from the HIV franchise, which is based on products marketed by Gilead that contain emtricitabine, including Biktarvy, Genvoya and Truvada, among others, decreased by $215.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven by the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion and $581.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.0 billion and $983.3 million, respectively. We intend to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash and cash equivalents, sales of marketable securities, future cash flows from operations or the issuance of additional debt. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the sales of the underlying pharmaceutical products in which we hold royalties, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. Currently, we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives.\nIncluded below is a table of investment activity over each of the last ten years based on the type of investment at the acquisition date. Amounts presented in the table below reflect cash paid at the acquisition date; any associated contractual payments are reflected in the period in which cash was paid.\nOther royalty income increased by $34.1 million, or 179.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by increased income from Nurtec ODT and Trodelvy that arose from our R&D funding agreements with Biohaven and Immunomedics, respectively. Other royalty income in the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes income from the HIV franchise, a fully amortized financial royalty asset, and Letairis, which was also fully amortized, but for which we expect minimal residual royalty income.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures presented as supplemental measures to our GAAP financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. In each case, because our operating performance is a function of our liquidity, the non-GAAP measures used by management are presented and defined as supplemental liquidity measures. We caution readers that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of Adjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies. Not all companies and analysts calculate the non-GAAP measures we use in the same manner. We compensate for these limitations by using non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by presenting the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures, in each case being Net cash provided by operating activities.\nAs the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the value of the Legacy SLP Interest is expected to decline over time. Our equity method investee, the Legacy Investors Partnerships, also owns a non-controlling interest in Old RPI.\nIn January 2021, Orladeyo was approved in Japan, becoming the first and only prophylactic HAE medication approved in the region.\n\u2022In October 2020, we acquired the residual royalty interest in Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise owned by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The agreement includes an upfront payment of $575 million and a potential milestone payment of $75 million.\n\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we acquired an equity method investment from the Continuing Investors Partnerships in the form of a special limited partnership interest in the Legacy Investors Partnerships (the Legacy SLP Interest\u201d) in exchange for issuing shares in our subsidiary. The Legacy SLP Interest entitles us to the equivalent of performance distribution payments that would have been paid to the general partner of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and a performance income allocation on a similar basis. The performance income allocation attributable to us is equal to the general partner's former contractual rights to the income of the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nOur borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nUses of Capital\nIn June 2021, Exelixis and Ipsen announced that COSMIC-312, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The trial met one of its primary endpoints by demonstrating significant improvement in progression-free survival at the planned primary analysis. However, a prespecified interim analysis was not statistically significant for the second primary endpoint of overall survival. Based on the preliminary overall survival data, Exelixis anticipates that the probability of reaching statistical significance at the time of the final analysis is low.\n(3) The HIV franchise includes the following approved products: Atripla, Truvada, Emtriva, Complera, Stribild, Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey, Symtuza and Biktarvy. Royalties are received on the emtricitabine portion of sales only.\nIn 2019, we entered into an amended agreement with BAv Financing II, LP ( Avillion II\u201d, or, together with Avillion I, the Avillion Entities\u201d), to invest $19.0 million to fund approximately 50% of the costs of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the use of Merck KGaA's anti-IL 17 nanobody M1095 (the Merck KGaA Asset\u201d) for the treatment of psoriasis in exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments. During 2020, our involvement in the development for the Merck KGaA Asset ceased. We do not expect to record significant earnings or losses in the future related to this investment.\nPortfolio Overview\nIn August 2020, Vertex announced that the EC had granted marketing authorization of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older with onedel mutation and one minimal function mutation, or twodel mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total provision expense of $452.8 million, of which $465.8 million and $12.9 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision income for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for Tazverik, Imbruvica, Emgality and the cystic fibrosis franchise, primarily due to significant declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Tysabri. The current expected credit loss activity in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in provision income that was primarily driven by a significant decrease in current expected credit losses related to Tazverik as a result of the corresponding significant decline in the financial asset value. This was partially offset by provision expense for credit losses recognized as a result of the increases to our portfolio of financial royalty assets with limited protective rights, primarily related to zavegepant from a $100.0 million funding payment we made to Biohaven upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program and a new royalty interest in Cabometyx/Cometriq.\nIn April 2021, Vertex announced EC approval for Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have at least onedel mutation.\nIn June 2021, Phase 3 GLOW study results for Imbruvica in combination with Venetoclax for the treatment of first-line CLL and SLL demonstrated superior progression-free survival versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab as a first-line treatment of CLL. The study also showed improved duration of remission and significantly improved depth of remission. AbbVie has indicated that approval could occur in 2022.\nR&D funding expense\nOther operating expenses\nFinancial Overview\nTotal income and other revenues is primarily comprised of income from our financial royalty assets, royalty revenue from our intangible royalty assets, and royalty income arising from successful commercialization of products developed through joint R&D funding arrangements. Most of our royalties on both approved products and development-stage product candidates that are not accounted for as R&D funding expense are classified as financial assets as our ownership rights are generally passive in nature. In instances in which we acquire a royalty that does include more substantial rights or ownership of the underlying intellectual property, we classify such royalties as intangible assets.\n\u2022Evrysdi. In August 2020, the FDA approved Evrysdi, the first at-home, orally administered treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children ages 2 months and older.\nIn June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, which closed on July 15, 2021. As part of the partnership, we agreed to provide MorphoSys up to $350 million of Development Funding Bonds, which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In return, we expect to receive a return of 2.2 times the amount funded on the Development Funding Bonds payable on a quarterly basis over nine years, with the first payment beginning two years after the funding. As of December 31, 2021, MorphoSys has not drawn any amount under the Development Funding Bonds.\nDistributions to Shareholders/Unitholders\nIn connection with our IPO, we consummated an exchange offer on February 11, 2020 (the Exchange Date\u201d). Through the exchange offer, investors representing 82% of the aggregate limited partnership in the various partnerships owned by Old RPI (the Legacy Investors Partnerships\u201d), exchanged their limited partnership interests in the Legacy Investors Partnerships for limited partnership interests in RPI US Partners 2019, LP, a Delaware limited partnership or RPI International Holdings 2019, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (together, the Continuing Investors Partnerships\u201d). The exchange offer transaction together with (i) the concurrent incurrence of indebtedness under a new credit facility and (ii) the issuance of additional interests in Continuing Investors Partnerships to satisfy performance payments payable in respect of assets acquired prior to the date of the IPO are referred to as the Exchange Offer Transactions.\u201d\n\u2022Research & Development ( R&D\u201d) Funding - We have historically funded ongoing R&D, typically for large biopharmaceutical companies, in exchange for future royalties and/or milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved. We have also made upfront R&D payments to biotechnology companies to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $323.7 million to $1.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the factors noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP).\u201d Payments for operating and professional costs, the only adjustment between Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted EBITDA, increased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher Operating and Personnel Payments under the terms of our Management Agreement offset by a decrease in non-recurring professional services fees, restructuring fees and refinancing fees incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and the IPO.\n\u2022Commercial performance. The approval of a product for use in new indications can extend the date through which we are entitled to royalties or milestones on that product. For certain financial royalty assets, such as the cystic fibrosis franchise, we are entitled to royalties on approved combination products and may be entitled to royalties on future combination products, which, once approved, create new cash flow streams which were not initially contemplated and whose sales were previously not reflected in expected future cash flows. We generally do not recognize income from, or forecast sales for, unapproved products or indications. If a product is removed from all or a portion of a market, subsequent sell-side equity research analysts' forecasts will reflect the expected drop in sales. Both the new cash flow streams and the cessation of cash flow streams related to a product's performance in the market over the royalty term can materially affect our forecast of expected future cash flows.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nGuarantor Financial Information\n\u2022Imbruvica. In April 2020, Imbruvica received FDA approval for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\n\u2022In April 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in Oxlumo from Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront cash payment of $180 million and up to $60 million in contingent sales-based milestone payments. Oxlumo, which has been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1, is marketed by Alnylam.\nIn December 2021, Cytokinetics announced the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for aficamten for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM based on results from REDWOOD-HCM. Cytokinetics has indicated it plans to initiate a pivotal study of aficamten in oHCM in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn May 2021, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the preventative treatment of migraine, indicated for adult patients with episodic migraine who experience less than 15 headache days per month.\nThe remaining 34% of RPCT is owned by the Legacy Investors Partnerships and Royalty Pharma Select Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPSFT\u201d), which is wholly owned by Royalty Pharma Select, an Irish unit trust. From the Exchange Date until the expiration of the Legacy Investors Partnerships' investment period on June 30, 2020 (the Legacy Date\u201d), the Legacy Investors Partnerships had the option to participate proportionately in any investment made by Old RPI. Following the Legacy Date, Old RPI ceased making new investments and each of Old RPI and the Legacy Investors Partnerships became legacy entities. Following the Legacy Date, we have made and plan to make new investments solely through our subsidiaries.\n\u2022In December 2020, we acquired royalty interests from BioCryst on (1) Orladeyo (berotralstat) to support the launch of the product in hereditary angioedema (HAE) and (2) its development stage Factor D inhibitor BCX9930 in exchange for an upfront cash payment of $125 million.\nFactors Impacting Expected Future Cash Flows\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nOther income, net of $219.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily comprised of net gains on equity securities of $247.1 million, of which $292.3 million was driven by the redemption of our investment in Immunomedics common stock upon Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics in October 2020 and $66.0 million was related to an increase in share price of our investment in Biohaven common shares. These gains were partially offset by a loss of $120.1 million related to a decrease in share price of our investment in Epizyme common stock. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized $42.1 million in losses on our derivative financial instruments, primarily related to Epizyme warrants as a result of the decrease in Epizyme common stock price. Additionally, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $30.5 million related to the debt refinancings completed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRefer to the section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures.\nRoyalty Pharma plc is an English public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales that was created for the purpose of consolidating our predecessor entities and facilitating the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of our Class A ordinary shares that was completed in June 2020. Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma plc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. After the consummation of the Exchange Offer Transactions (as defined below) and execution of the Management Agreement (collectively, the Reorganization Transactions\u201d) in February 2020 and before the consummation of the IPO, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV ( RPI 2019 ICAV\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments, an Irish unit trust ( Old RPI\u201d).\nIn addition, we believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow help identify underlying trends in the business and permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company, including planning and forecasting for future periods. Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, voluntary debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures help management, the audit committee and investors evaluate our ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\nNet income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships, which arose in February 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, was $266.6 million and $321.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the Exchange Date in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to Old RPI in 2021.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT - Royalty receipts from Nurtec ODT, marketed by Biohaven and Pfizer for the acute treatment of migraine, were $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, as a result of the approval of Nurtec ODT in February 2020, we received $62.5 million in fixed payments from Biohaven in the year ended December 31, 2021, which represent the first four of 16 consecutive quarterly payments to be received from Biohaven relating to the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares.\nThe Avillion Entities\nIn June 2021, Vertex announced that FDA approved Trikafta for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis ages 6 through 11 who have at least onedel mutation or have certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nAs a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions, we own, through our subsidiary RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPI Intermediate FT\u201d), an 82% economic interest in Old RPI. Through our 82% indirect ownership of Old RPI, we are legally entitled to 82% of the economics of Old RPI's wholly-owned subsidiaries, RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPIFT\u201d) and RPI Acquisitions (Ireland), Limited ( RPI Acquisitions\u201d), an Irish private limited company, and 66% of Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPCT\u201d).\nThe provision for changes in expected future cash flows from financial royalty assets includes the following:\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay up to $330 million to purchase a royalty owned by Eisai, on future worldwide sales outside Japan of Tazverik (tazemetostat), a novel targeted therapy in late-stage clinical development with the potential to be approved in several cancer indications. We acquired a portion Eisai's future worldwide royalties on net sales by Epizyme of Tazverik outside Japan, for an upfront payment of $110 million plus up to an additional $220 million for the remainder of the royalty upon FDA approval of Tazverik for certain indications. The FDA approved Tazverik in January 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma which triggered our obligation to fund the second $110 million tranche in November 2020. In June 2020, the FDA approval of additional indications triggered our recognition of a liability for the final tranche of $110.0 million, which was paid in November 2021.\n\nKey developments and upcoming events relating to our portfolio\n\u2022Promacta - Royalty receipts from Promacta, which is marketed by Novartis for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, increased by $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This growth was primarily driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia in the United States.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in Net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that our existing capital resources, cash provided by operating activities and our Revolving Credit Facility will continue to allow us to meet our operating and working capital requirements, to fund planned strategic acquisitions and R&D funding arrangements, and to meet our debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. We have historically operated at a low level of fixed operating costs. Our primary cash operating expenses, other than R&D funding commitments, include interest expense, our Operating and Personnel Payments, and legal and professional fees.\nThe royalty duration is important for purposes of accurately measuring interest income over the life of a financial royalty asset. In making assumptions around the royalty duration for terms that are not contractually fixed, management considers the strength of existing patent protection, expected entry of generics, geographical exclusivity periods and potential patent term extensions tied to the underlying product. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing for the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations.\nOther expense/(income), net primarily includes the change in fair market value of our equity securities and the unrealized (gains)/losses on our available for sale debt securities, including related forwards and derivatives. Other expense/(income), net also includes losses on extinguishment of debt and interest income.\nEven though we believe interest income from financial royalty assets and the associated non-cash provision for changes in future cash flows are not indicative of our near-term financial performance and should not be used as a source for predicting future income or growth trends, changes in the aforementioned assumptions could result in a material impact to our financial statements. A shortened royalty term can result in a reduction in interest income, significant reductions in total royalty payments over time compared to expectations or a permanent impairment. If the effective interest rate is lower for the current period than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected) this would result in the immediate recognition of non-cash provision expense even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. Changes in sell-side equity research analyst consensus sales forecasts directly impact future interest income and recognition of any provision income or expense in a similar manner.\nManagement uses Adjusted Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate cash and performance of the business and to evaluate the Company's performance as compared to its peer group. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income measures used by many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, even though each company may customize its own calculation and therefore one company's metric may not be directly comparable to another's. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Cash Flow, are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets is derived from sales of Januvia, Janumet and other DPP-IV products by our licensees.\n(2) Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs include the following approved products: Tradjenta, Onglyza, Kombiglyze, Galvus, Eucreas and Nesina. The Other DPP-IVs are marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Takeda.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Certain of these policies are considered critical as they have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of income and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe made distributions of $739.3 million to unitholders in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into an expanded agreement with Biohaven for up to $450 million to fund the development of zavegepant and the commercialization of Nurtec ODT. Biohaven received an upfront payment of $150 million at closing and received an additional $100 million payment in March 2021 upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program. We will receive a royalty on Nurtec ODT and zavegepant and success-based milestone payments based on zavegepant regulatory approvals. We are also committed to provide further support for the ongoing launch of Nurtec ODT through the purchase of committed, non-contingent Commercial Launch Preferred Equity (defined below) for a total of $200 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In return, Biohaven will pay a series of equal fixed payments from the three months ended March 31, 2025 through the three months ended December 31, 2030.\nOur most critical accounting policies relate to our financial royalty assets and the full descriptions can be found in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of our financial royalty assets at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method. The application of the prospective approach to calculate interest income from our financial royalty assets requires management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events.\nIn November 2021, Biohaven announced a strategic collaboration with Pfizer for the commercialization of rimegepant outside the United States. Pfizer also gains rights outside the U.S. to zavegepant, which is being studied in an intranasal delivery and an oral formulation in Phase 3 clinical trials for migraine indications.\n4. The fourth minority interest is attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT as a result of a 2011 reorganization transaction. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and is expected to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\nIn March 2021, Biohaven announced that it enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant for the preventive treatment of migraine. Accordingly, per the agreement with Biohaven announced in August 2020, Royalty Pharma paid $100 million to Biohaven for the achievement of this milestone, bringing the total zavegepant funding to $250 million.\nFinancing activities\nBiohaven has indicated it expects an EMA decision on Vydura (rimegepant) in the first half of 2022.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded total provision expense of $230.8 million, of which $74.7 million and $156.2 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision expense for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for IDHIFA, which was acquired in the year ended December 31, 2020, and for Imbruvica and Tysabri due to declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Xtandi. We recognized provision expense for current expected credit losses as a result of our adoption of the new accounting standard in the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision expense for current expected credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven primarily by certain additions to our portfolio of financial royalty assets, including the additional tranche of Tazverik and our acquisition of the zavegepant royalty.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, which is derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\n\nOur obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RP Holdings, a non-wholly owned subsidiary (the Guarantor Subsidiary\u201d). Our remaining subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d) do not guarantee the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, Royalty Pharma plc and the Guarantor Subsidiary each fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee the payment of interest, principal and premium, if any, on the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the par value and carrying value of the total outstanding and guaranteed Notes was $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced that the FDA granted an accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either a programmed death receptor-1 or a programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor. The accelerated approval was based on data from the international Phase 2, single-arm TROPHY study.\nThe fourth non-controlling interest related to ownership in RPCT held by RPSFT, is the only non-controlling interest that existed prior to the Exchange Offer Transactions and is reflected in our financial statements through December 31, 2019. The non-controlling interest related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI is reflected in our financial statements from and after the Exchange Date. The other two non-controlling interests are reflected in our financial statements from and after the date of our IPO. All of the results of operations of RP Holdings, Old RPI and RPCT are consolidated into our financial statements.\n\u2022Cabometyx/Cometriq - Royalty receipts from Cabometyx/Cometriq, which is marketed by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda, were $33.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Cabometyx/Cometriq royalty in March 2021.\n\u2022Omecamtiv mecarbil. In November 2020, Amgen, Cytokinetics and Servier presented the results of GALACTIC-HF study, a Phase 3 trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure, at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. The trial met the primary composite endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure events, but did not meet the secondary endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death. Cytokinetics subsequently regained global rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil when Amgen and Servier elected to terminate their collaboration agreement effective, May 2021. Following the Phase 3 results and termination of the collaboration, we wrote off the full value of our financial royalty asset given the uncertainty around the future of omecamtiv mecarbil.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we made a $100 million investment in Epizyme. In exchange for an upfront payment of $100 million, we received (1) shares of Epizyme common stock, (2) a warrant to purchase an additional 2.5 million shares of Epizyme common stock at $20 per share over a three-year term and (3) Epizyme's royalty on sales of Tazverik in Japan payable by Eisai. We also lowered Epizyme's royalty on Tazverik above certain sales thresholds and granted Epizyme an 18-month put option to sell an additional $50 million of its common stock to RPIFT at then-prevailing prices, not to exceed $20 per share. Epizyme exercised its put option on December 30, 2019, which resulted in Epizyme issuing RPIFT 2.5 million shares on settlement in February 2020.\n*Percentage change is not meaningful.\n(4) Includes royalty receipts for Nurtec ODT of $7.7 million and quarterly redemptions of $15.6 million of the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares (presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows) for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount also includes a payment from Biohaven in respect of an expired option to exercise additional funding of the Biohaven Series A Preferred Shares which is presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs the former activity is a combination of income and expense items, the provision breakdown by product, exclusive of the provision for current expected credit losses, is as follows, based on the largest contributors to each year's provision income or expense:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5) Other products primarily include royalties on the following products: Bosulif (a product co-developed by our joint venture investee, Avillion, for which receipts are presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows), Lexiscan, Soliqua, Nesina, Cimzia, Letairis, Entyvio, Myozyme, Mircera and Lyrica. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a one-time milestone payment of $45.0 million that we received on Soliqua. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a one-time $21.3 million distribution from Avillion in respect of the Merck KGaA Asset for which the receipt is presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates in both the operating and investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Date, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest.\nIn June 2021, Evrysdi was approved in Japan for the treatment of SMA.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Receipts (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCash flows\nIn November 2021, Gilead announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Trodelvy as a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for advanced disease. The EC's decision is supported by results from the Phase 3 ASCENT study, where Trodelvy reduced the risk of death by 49% and improved median overall survival to 11.8 months versus 6.9 months with physician's choice of chemotherapy.\nThe following financial information presents summarized combined balance sheet financial information as of December 31, 2021, and summarized combined statement of operations information for the year ended December 31, 2021 for Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings. All intercompany balances and transactions between Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings are eliminated in the presentation of the combined financial statements. RP Holdings' most significant asset is its investment in operating subsidiaries, which has been eliminated in the table below to exclude investments in Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries hold the majority of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and financial royalty assets. As a result, our ability to make required payments on the Notes depends on the performance of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. There are no material restrictions on distributions from the operating subsidiaries. Amounts presented below do not represent our total consolidated amounts as of December 31, 2021 or for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Development-Stage Product Candidates - We acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates that have demonstrated strong clinical proof of concept. From 2012, when we began acquiring royalties on development-stage product candidates, through 2021, we have deployed $7.8 billion to acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses include primarily Operating and Personnel Payments, legal expenses, other expenses for professional services and share-based compensation. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nOther royalty income includes primarily income from financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized by the expected expiry date and royalty income from synthetic royalties arising out of R&D funding arrangements. Occasionally, a royalty asset may be amortized on an accelerated basis due to collectability concerns, which, if resolved, may result in future cash collections when no financial royalty asset remains. Similarly, we may continue to collect royalties on a financial royalty asset beyond the estimated patent expiration date by which the financial asset was amortized in full. In each scenario where a financial royalty asset has been fully amortized, income from such royalty is recognized as Other royalty income.\n(a)Dates shown represent our estimates as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K of when a royalty will substantially end, which may depend on clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, contractual terms, commercial developments, our estimates of patent expiration dates (which may include estimated patent term extensions) or other factors and may vary by geography. There can be no assurances that our royalties will expire when expected.\nG&A expenses\nIn connection with our IPO, Royalty Pharma plc became a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in RP Holdings, which is the sole equity owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, an entity that is included in our consolidated financial statements. We report non-controlling interest related to four minority interests in our subsidiaries held by third parties.\n\u2022the movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\n(b)Royalty is perpetual; year shown represents Trikafta expected patent expiration and potential sales decline based on timing of generic entry.\n(3) The HIV franchise includes the following approved products: Atripla, Truvada, Emtriva, Complera, Stribild, Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey, Symtuza and Biktarvy. Royalties are received on the emtricitabine portion of sales only.\nOther operating expenses were $65.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge related to the write-off of our omecamtiv mecarbil financial royalty asset balance of $90.2 million, net of cumulative allowance of $25.2 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, it was announced that omecamtiv mecarbil, a development stage product, did not meet the clinical trial objectives. There was no comparable activity in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n3. The third minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held indirectly by the Continuing Investors Partnerships, which represent an approximate 29% ownership interest in RP Holdings as of December 31, 2021 and are exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 44,763 thousand RP Holdings Class B Interests were exchanged for our Class A ordinary shares.\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nOur operations have historically been financed primarily with cash flows generated by our royalties. Due to the nature of our accounting methodology for our financial royalty assets, there is no direct correlation between our income from royalties and our royalty receipts. As noted above, income from such royalties is measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method accounting methodology. Given the importance of cash flows and their predictability to management's operation of the business, management uses royalty receipts as the primary measure of our operating performance. Royalty receipts refer to the summation of the following line items from our GAAP Statement of Cash Flows: Cash collections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates.\n\nThe Avillion entities (as defined below) partner with global biopharmaceutical companies to perform R&D in exchange for success-based milestones and/or royalties once products are commercialized.\nOngoing investment in new royalties is fundamental to the long-term prospects of our business. New investments provide a source of growth for our royalty receipts, supplementing growth within our existing portfolio and offsetting declines for products in our portfolio that have lost market exclusivity. We evaluate an array of royalty acquisition opportunities on a continuous basis and expect to continue to make acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business. Our team has established a strong track record of identifying, evaluating and investing in royalties tied to leading products across therapeutic areas and treatment modalities. We invest in approved products and development-stage product candidates that have generated robust proof of concept data. We invest in these therapies through the purchase of royalties, by making hybrid investments and by acquiring businesses with significant existing royalty assets or the potential for the creation of such assets.\n(c)Under terms of the agreement, RPIFT acquired a perpetual royalty on net sales of Tysabri. Management has applied an end date of 2031 for purposes of accreting income over the royalty term, which is periodically reviewed.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future principal and interest payments under our Notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nSummary of royalty acquisition activity\nWe have historically funded our acquisition program through free cash flow, equity contributions and debt. Our low operating costs coupled with a lack of capital expenditures and low taxes have contributed to our strong financial profile, resulting in high operating leverage and high conversion of our Adjusted Cash Receipts to Adjusted Cash Flow. We expect to continue funding our current and planned operating costs (excluding acquisitions) principally through our cash flow from operations and our acquisition program through cash flow and issuances of equity and debt. In the past, we have supplemented our available cash and cash equivalents on hand with attractive debt capital to fund certain strategic acquisitions.\n(4) Includes royalty receipts for Nurtec ODT of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and quarterly redemptions of $15.6 million of the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares (presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows) in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount also includes a payment from Biohaven in respect of an expired option to exercise additional funding of the Biohaven Series A Preferred Shares which is presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows in 2020.\n\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nGilead has indicated that it expects progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival data from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial in hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative metastatic breast cancer in March 2022.\nPrior to the Exchange Date, operating and personnel payments were fixed and grew at 5% annually and were not linked to any financial line item.\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nDistributions to non-controlling interest decreased by $64.3 million to $479.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which positively impacted Adjusted Cash Receipts. The decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest is primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these decreases was a distribution to non-controlling interest related to the one-time milestone payment we received on Soliqua in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn January 2022, Gilead announced it has entered into two clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with Merck & Co. to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As part of the collaboration, Merck will sponsor a global Phase 3 clinical trial of Trodelvy in combination with Keytruda as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the companies recently established an agreement whereby Gilead will sponsor a Phase 2 signal-seeking study evaluating combinations that include pembrolizumab in first-line NSCLC.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Reporting\nWe paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $285.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We do not have a legal obligation to pay a quarterly dividend or dividends at any specified rate or at all.\nIn March 2021, Ipsen announced that the EC approved the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.\n\nThe key developments impacting our cash receipts and income and revenue from our royalty interests are discussed below:\nG&A expenses were relatively flat in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs include the following approved products: Tradjenta, Onglyza, Kombiglyze, Galvus, Eucreas and Nesina. The Other DPP-IVs are marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Takeda.\nOverview\nWe recognize interest income related to our financial royalty assets. Royalty revenue relates solely to revenue from our DPP-IV patent estate for which the patent rights have been licensed to various counterparties. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the royalty payors accounting for greater than 10% of our total income and other revenues in any one year are shown in the table below:\nInvestments Overview\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes RPSFT's 20% share of earnings in RPCT, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Old RPI. We expect net income attributable to this non-controlling interest to decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\nOn February 11, 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and using funds contributed by RPI Intermediate FT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships, RPIFT repaid its outstanding debt and accrued interest, and terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps. RPI Intermediate FT, as borrower, entered into a term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto from time to time and the other parties thereto. In September 2020, we repaid in full the outstanding principal amounts of term loans under the senior secured credit facilities with the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes and available cash on hand.\nAcquisitions of royalties\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest expense\nSignificant Assumptions Applied in Developing Forecasted Expected Future Cash Flows\nOther Funding Arrangements\nResults of Operations\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within the Company's credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the assessment of our liquidity.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Flow (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn July 26, 2021, we issued $1.3 billion of the 2021 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.80% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $36.4 million, paid semi-annually. On September 2, 2020, we issued $6.0 billion of the 2020 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.125% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $127.5 million, paid semi-annually. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes offering, together with available cash on hand, to repay in full the senior secured credit facilities. Indentures governing the Notes contain certain covenants, which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2021.\nNet income attributable to RPSFT was $57.6 million and $88.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect net income attributable to RPSFT to continue to decline as the royalty assets owned by RPCT mature.\n\u2022Trodelvy. In April 2020, Immunomedics announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.\nDebt service\nIncome from financial royalty assets by product for our top products for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows, in order of contribution to income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Xtandi - Royalty receipts from Xtandi, which is marketed by Pfizer and Astellas for the treatment of prostate cancer, increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by demand across various prostate cancer indications.\nOther royalty income\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nAdjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $20.5 million in ongoing development-stage funding payments, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi, and $5.8 million in upfront funding related to a royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst.\nOther expense, net of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily comprised of net losses on equity securities of $48.1 million, including losses on MorphoSys ordinary shares and Epizyme common stock, partially offset by a gain on Biohaven common shares; and losses of $21.5 million on our derivative financial instruments related to our treasury rate lock contracts that were unwound and settled in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. The losses were partially offset by interest income of $50.9 million related to our Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and a gain of $17.9 million on the unrealized change in fair value of our available for sale debt securities.\nThe provision for changes in expected cash flows is the current period activity resulting from adjustments to the cumulative allowance for changes in expected cash flows, which is netted against the non-current portion of Financial royalty assets, net balance on the consolidated balance sheets. As discussed above, income is accreted on our financial royalty assets using the effective interest method. As we update our forecasted cash flows on a periodic basis and recalculate the present value of the remaining future cash flows, any shortfall when compared to the carrying value of the financial royalty asset is recorded directly to the income statement through the line item Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets. If, in a subsequent period, there is an increase in expected cash flows or if actual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously expected, we reduce the cumulative allowance previously established for a financial royalty asset for the incremental increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. This results in provision income (i.e., a credit to the provision).\n\nIn March 2021, Roche announced that the EC approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in patients two months of age and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four splicing modifier of motor neuron 2 copies.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nTo arrive at Adjusted EBITDA, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments and (5) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase of $187.4 million in upfront R&D funding and an increase of $27.2 million in interest paid. The increase was driven by upfront R&D funding payments of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product acquired in connection with our expanded funding agreement with BioCryst and $90.0 million related royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys. The increase in interest paid was primarily due to the shift from quarterly to semi-annual interest payments with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, for which we did not make any interest payments on the 2020 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in cash collections from financial royalty assets of $193.9 million.\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nWe are the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry. Since our founding in 1996, we have been pioneers in the royalty market, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies. We have assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles us to payments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry's leading therapies, which includes royalties on more than 35 commercial products, including AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson's Imbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer's Xtandi, Biogen's Tysabri, Johnson & Johnson's Tremfya, Gilead's Trodelvy, Merck's Januvia, Novartis' Promacta, Vertex's Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta, and ten development-stage product candidates. We fund innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly - directly when we partner with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when we acquire existing royalties from the original innovators.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we acquired the following: (1) a royalty on Promacta, an approved product for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, from Ligand Pharmaceuticals in exchange for an upfront payment of $827 million, (2) a royalty on Lilly's Emgality, an approved product for the treatment of migraine, from Atlas Ventures and Orbimed for $260 million and (3) a royalty on Johnson & Johnson's Erleada, an approved product for the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Regents of the University of California for $105.4 million and potential future milestones.\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise. In October 2019, Vertex received approval from the FDA for Trikafta for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older who have at least one copy of thedel mutation.\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Receipts, we start with the GAAP line item, Net cash provided by operating activities, and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily the redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), which are cash inflows that management believes are derived from royalties and form part of our core business strategy, (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments, (5) Payments for operating and professional costs, (6) Payments for rebates and (7) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest, which represents distributions to our historical non-controlling interest attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by certain legacy investors and to a new non-controlling interest that was created as a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions in February 2020 related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net, both of which are excluded when management assesses its operating performance through cash collections, or, Adjusted Cash Receipts.\n\u2022Approved Products - We acquire royalties in approved products that generate predictable cash flows and may offer upside potential from unapproved indications. Since inception in 1996 through 2021, we have deployed $15.0 billion of cash to acquire royalties on approved products. From 2012 through 2021, we have acquired $10.2 billion of royalties on approved products.\nInvesting activities\nThe breakdown of our provision for changes in expected future cash flows includes the following:\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nFollowing the IPO, EPA Holdings is entitled to receive Equity Performance Awards through its RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. Equity Performance Awards owed to EPA Holdings will be recognized as an equity transaction when the obligation becomes due and will impact the income allocated to non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest at that time. We do not currently expect any material Equity Performance Awards to be payable until certain performance conditions are met, which we do not expect to occur until the mid-2020s.\n2. The second minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class C ordinary share (the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest\u201d) held by RPI EPA Holdings, LP ( EPA Holdings\u201d), an affiliate of the Manager. Income will not be allocated to this non-controlling interest until certain conditions are met.\nIn May 2021, Exelixis announced results from cohort six of COSMIC-021, a Phase 1b trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In high-risk patients, the combination of Cabometyx and atezolizumab resulted in objective response rates of 27% and 18% per investigator assessment and Blinded Independent Radiology Committee, respectively.\n\u2022In July 2020, we acquired a royalty on risdiplam, a development-stage product for the treatment of Types 1, 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) from PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $650 million. Evrysdi (risdiplam) was subsequently approved by the FDA in August 2020, representing the first, oral treatment approved for infants, children and adults with all SMA types.\nIn August 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL. This milestone marked the 11th FDA approval for Imbruvica since it was first approved in 2013 and sixth in CLL.\n\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we entered into a preferred share purchase agreement with Biohaven through which we purchased $125 million in Series A Preferred Shares, providing us with a fixed return on redemption of two times our investment on FDA approval of Biohaven's pipeline product, Nurtec ODT, for migraine treatment. The FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults in February 2020.\nOur financial royalty assets represent investments in cash flow streams with yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method. We calculate the effective interest rate using forecasted expected cash flows to be received over the life of the royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. Interest income is recognized at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the asset, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively. As changes in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates are updated on a quarterly basis, the effective rate of return changes. For example, if sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increase, the yield to derive income on a financial royalty asset will increase and result in higher income for subsequent periods.\nIn December 2021, Alnylam submitted a supplemental New Drug Application for lumasiran to the FDA and a Type II Variation with the EMA for the reduction of plasma oxalate in the treatment of patients with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results\n(1) The cystic fibrosis franchise includes the following approved products: Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio.\n\n\u2022Tremfya - Royalty receipts from Tremfya, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson, were $35.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Tremfya royalty in July 2021.\nWe evaluate financial royalty assets for impairment on an individual basis by comparing the effective interest rate at each reporting date to that of the prior period. If the effective interest rate for the current period is lower than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected), management records a provision for the change in expected cash flows. The provision is measured as the difference between the financial royalty asset's amortized cost basis and the net present value of the expected future cash flows, calculated based on the prior period's effective interest rate. The amount recognized as provision expense increases the financial royalty asset's cumulative allowance, which reduces the net carrying value of the financial royalty asset.\n\u2022Tysabri. In April 2021, Biogen announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for a subcutaneous injection of Tysabri to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Biogen also announced that it had received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for its sBLA for subcutaneous Tysabri. The Complete Response Letter indicates that the FDA is unable to approve Biogen's filing as submitted. Biogen announced that it is evaluating the Complete Response Letter and will determine next steps in the United States.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, as derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\nAs of and following the Exchange Date, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes the Legacy Investors Partnerships' approximately 18% share of earnings in Old RPI. As the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the related net income attributable to this non-controlling interest is expected to decline over time.\nEquity in earnings of the Legacy SLP Interest was $8.9 million and $62.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity in losses of the Avillion Entities was $28.4 million and $17.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdditionally, in April 2021, we entered into an agreement with MSCI Inc. ( MSCI\u201d), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services where we will assist MSCI to design a classification framework and index methodologies which will expand MSCI's thematic index suite with the launch of new indexes. In return, we will receive a portion of MSCI's revenues from those indexes. The financial statement impact associated with this transaction was not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Zavegepant. In December 2019, Biohaven announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine.\nAs a result of the non-cash charges associated with applying the effective interest method accounting methodology, our income statement activity in respect of many of our royalties can be volatile and unpredictable. Small declines in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts over a long time horizon can result in an immediate non-cash income statement expense recognition, even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. For example, in late 2014 we acquired the cystic fibrosis franchise royalty, which is classified as a financial royalty asset. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, declines in near-term sales forecasts of sell-side equity research analysts caused us to recognize non-cash provision expenses to the income statement and build up a corresponding cumulative allowance which reduced the gross balance for this financial royalty asset. Over the course of 10 quarters, we recognized non-cash provision expenses as a result of these changes in forecasts including non-cash provision expense of $743.2 million in 2016, ultimately reaching a peak cumulative allowance of $1.30 billion by September 30, 2017 related to this financial royalty asset. With the approval of the Vertex triple combination therapy, Trikafta, in October 2019, sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increased to reflect the larger addressable market and the extension of the expected duration of the Trikafta royalty. While small reductions in the cumulative allowance for the cystic fibrosis franchise were recognized as provision income in 2017 and 2018, there remained a $1.10 billion cumulative allowance that was fully reduced by $1.10 billion recognized in 2019 as a result of an increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts associated with the Trikafta approval. This example illustrates the volatility caused by our accounting model. Therefore, management believes investors should not look to income from royalties and the associated provision for changes in future cash flows as a measure of our near-term financial performance or as a source for predicting future income or growth trends.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nAstellas and Pfizer have indicated that there could be a potential readout of the Phase 3 EMBARK trial for high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer in the second half of 2022.\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities is the closest comparable GAAP financial measure to the supplemental non-GAAP liquidity measures that follow.\n(5) Other products primarily include royalties on the following products: Bosulif (a product co-developed by our joint venture investee, Avillion, for which receipts are presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows), Lexiscan, Soliqua, Nesina, Cimzia, Letairis, Entyvio, Myozyme, Mircera and Lyrica. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a one-time milestone payment of $45.0 million that we received on Soliqua. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a one-time $21.3 million distribution from Avillion in respect of the Merck KGaA Asset (defined below) for which the receipt is presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates in both the operating and investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Transactions, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest (defined below).\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the $1.9 billion net proceeds received from our IPO in June 2020. Offsetting the decreases in cash provided by financing activities were net proceeds of $1.3 billion from issuance of 2021 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the net proceeds of $727.9 million related to the debt refinancings in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating activities\n\nThe table below includes the royalty receipts and non-GAAP financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by product in order of contribution to royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are similar non-GAAP liquidity measures that are both most closely comparable to the GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA is important to our lenders and is defined under the Credit Agreement as Adjusted Cash Receipts less Payments for operating and professional costs. Payments for operating and professional costs are comprised of Payments for operating and professional costs and Payments for rebates from the Statement of Cash Flows.\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Purchase Agreement ( Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Agreement\u201d) with Biohaven where we committed to acquire 3,992 shares of Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares at a price of $50,100 per preferred share (the Commercial Launch Preferred Equity\u201d), for a total of $200.0 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we began purchasing the Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares and have a remaining commitment of $129.6 million under our Commercial Launch Preferred Equity as of December 31, 2021.\nIn May 2021, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the EC approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\n\u2022Synthetic / Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product for which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\n(1) We began recognizing income related to Trodelvy in the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nIncome from financial royalty assets increased by $105.1 million, or 5.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the performance of the cystic fibrosis franchise, including additional interest income attributable to the residual royalty interest that we acquired in the three months ended December 31, 2020. We also recorded $57.0 million in income in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to newly acquired assets in 2021, primarily Cabometyx/Cometriq, Tremfya and Oxlumo. The increase in income was partially offset by declines from the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise.\nRoyalty Receipts\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nIn August 2021, AbbVie announced that the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware had issued a decision holding patent rights relating to Imbruvica were valid and infringed by a generic product from Alvogen and Natco. The decision, which is subject to appeal, prohibits regulatory approval of that generic product until the last AbbVie patent expires. Previously, AbbVie entered into several settlement and license agreements with other generic companies. Consequently, AbbVie does not expect any generic product entry prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted.\n\u2022Synthetic/Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we may also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product on which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\nOperating and Personnel Payments\nBelow we discuss the key drivers of royalty receipts.\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n\u2022Imbruvica - Royalty receipts from Imbruvica, which is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease, increased by $30.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued global penetration in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by modest market share losses in the United States, lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of COVID-19 inventory stocking.\nOther expense/(income), net\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced the FDA granted full approval to Trodelvy for adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for metastatic disease. The approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study.\nRefer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for additional discussion of the Notes and our debt refinancings in 2020.\nExelixis has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the COSMIC-313 trial in 1L RCC in the first half of 2022 and initial Phase 3 data in the second half of 2022 from CONTACT-01 in metastatic NSCLC and CONTACT-03 in advanced or metastatic RCC.\nRPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities\nWhile we classify our acquisitions in these two broad categories, several of our acquisitions of royalties on approved products were driven by the long-term potential of these products in other, unapproved indications. Similarly, some of our royalty acquisitions in development-stage product candidates are for products that are approved in other indications.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with previously treated radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. The approval was based on the Phase 3 COSMIC-311 pivotal trial.\nOur capital-efficient business model enables us to benefit from many of the most attractive characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry, including long product life cycles, significant barriers to entry and noncyclical revenues, but with substantially reduced exposure to many common industry challenges such as early stage development risk, therapeutic area constraints, high research and development costs, and high fixed manufacturing and marketing costs. We have a highly flexible approach that is agnostic to both therapeutic area and treatment modality, allowing us to acquire royalties on the most attractive therapies across the biopharmaceutical industry.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, most of the royalties we acquire are treated as investments in cash flow streams and are thus classified as financial assets. These investments have yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest accounting methodology. Under this accounting methodology, we calculate the effective interest rate on each financial royalty asset using a forecast of the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the financial royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. The yield, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively, is then recognized via accretion into our income at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the financial royalty asset.\nTotal income and other revenues\n\u2022Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs - Royalty receipts from the DPP-IVs for type 2 diabetes, which includes Januvia and Janumet, both marketed by Merck & Co., increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Xtandi. In December 2019, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the FDA approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer.\nWe have other funding arrangements where we are contractually obligated to fund R&D activities performed by our development partners and to provide additional capital related to our equity method investment in the Avillion entities. As our committed capital requirements are based on phases of development, the completion of which is highly uncertain, only the capital required to fund the current stage of development under such funding arrangements is considered committed capital requirements which approximate $41.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Oxlumo. In July 2021, Alnylam announced results from ILLUMINATE-C, a Phase 3 open-label study of lumasiran in patients of all ages with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1 associated with progressive decline in renal function. Results from the primary analysis at six months demonstrated a substantial reduction in plasma oxalate from baseline in patients with advanced disease, including those on hemodialysis. The safety and tolerability profile of lumasiran following six months of treatment was encouraging across all ages, with no drug related serious adverse events and injection site reactions as the most common adverse event.\nWhen royalty-bearing pharmaceutical products have limited or no coverage by sell-side equity research analysts, or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of our royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, we generally incorporate a statistical curve developed using historical sales data and available consensus sales projections to forecast product sales over the remaining life of the product. In cases where the statistical curve is not used, we use reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, publicly available information for the marketer, industry data and market trends and our own expertise.\nBusiness Overview\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\u2022Orladeyo. In December 2020, BioCryst announced that Orladeyo was approved by the FDA for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ages 12 years and older.\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners. We classify our product royalty acquisitions according to the following structures:", "item_7_text": "Most of the same variables and management's estimates affecting the recognition of interest income on our financial royalty assets also impact the provision. In any period, we will recognize provision income or expense as a result of the following factors: (1) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (2) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (3) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (4) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments.\n\u2022Royalty duration. The duration of a financial royalty asset can be based on a number of factors, such as regulatory and marketing approval dates, patent expiration dates, the number of years from first commercial sale, the first date of manufacture of the patent-protected product, strength of patent protection, the entry of generics or a contractual date arising from litigation, which are all impacted by the time in the product's life cycle at which we acquire the financial royalty asset. Royalty duration varies by geography as United States, European Union and other jurisdictions may be subject to different country-specific patent protection terms or exclusivity based on contractual terms. Products may be covered by a number of patents and, for products whose royalty term is linked to the existence of valid patents, management is required to make judgments about the patent providing the strongest patent protection to align the period over which management forecasts expected future cash flows to the royalty term.\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on a non-GAAP basis. The closest comparable GAAP measure to each of the non-GAAP measures that management review is Net cash provided by operating activities. The key non-GAAP metrics we focus on are Adjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow, each of which is further discussed in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Results.\u201d\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn September 15, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the credit agreement that our subsidiary, RP Holdings, as borrower, entered into on September 18, 2020, which provided for a five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement extends the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 15, 2026. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2021.\nInterest expense increased by $9.1 million, or 5.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by interest expense related to the $1.3 billion senior unsecured notes issued in July 2021 ( 2021 Notes\u201d) offset by the lower interest expense related to the $6.0 billion senior unsecured notes issued in September 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), which had a lower weighted average interest rate compared to the senior secured credit facilities that were in place during the year ended December 31, 2020. We refer to the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes, collectively, as the Notes\u201d.\nNet income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships was $297.3 million and $317.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the IPO in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the full period of net income in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income attributable to Continuing Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to RP Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was further driven by the ongoing exchanges in 2021 by investors in the Continuing Investors Partnerships who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests for our Class A ordinary shares, resulting in a decline in the Continuing Investors Partnerships' ownership of RP Holdings.\nFollowing management's determination that a high degree of common ownership exists in Royalty Pharma both before and after the Exchange Date, Royalty Pharma recognized Old RPI's assets and liabilities at the carrying value reflected on Old RPI's balance sheet as of the Exchange Date. Old RPI is our predecessor for financial reporting purposes. The results of operations in the following discussion is comprised of the financial results of Old RPI prior to the Reorganization Transactions, RPI 2019 ICAV subsequent to the Reorganization Transactions and before the consummation of the IPO, and Royalty Pharma plc subsequent to the consummation of the IPO.\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay quarterly Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the Adjusted Cash Receipts for such quarter and 0.25% of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. Because the Operating and Personnel Payments is determined based on Adjusted Cash Receipts, the amounts are fixed. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Gantenerumab. In October 2021, Roche announced that gantenerumab, an anti-amyloid beta antibody developed for subcutaneous administration, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of people living with Alzheimer's disease. This designation is based on data showing that gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid plaque, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, in the ongoing SCarlet RoAD and Marguerite RoAD open-label extension trials, as well as other studies. Roche has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the GRADUATE 1/2 trial in Alzheimer's disease in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn April 2021, BioCryst announced approval of Japanese National Health Insurance System price listing of Orladeyo for prophylactic treatment of HAE.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, in each case being Net cash provided by operating activities below.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts is a measure calculated with inputs directly from the Statement of Cash Flows and includes (1) royalty receipts by product: (i) Cash collections from royalty assets (financial assets and intangible assets), (ii) Other royalty cash collections, (iii) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates, plus (2) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities; less (3) Distributions to non-controlling interest, which represents contractual distributions of royalty receipts and proceeds from available for sale debt securities to our historical non-controlling interest attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by certain legacy investors and to the non-controlling interest that was created as a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions in February 2020 related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI. Adjusted Cash Receipts is most directly comparable to the GAAP measure of Net cash provided by operating activities.\nRevenue from intangible royalty interests increased by $27.9 million, or 19.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to the expected recovery of underpaid royalties on Tradjenta of approximately $16.5 million based on a legal judgment received in a litigation with Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nCommercial Products\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $889.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the overall net cash provided by marketable securities which was partially offset by a decrease of $268.9 million in proceeds from equity securities. We received $116.0 million related to the sale of our Cytokinetics common stock and a portion of our Biohaven common shares in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $384.8 million received from the full redemption of our investment in Immunomedics common stock upon its acquisition by Gilead in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was further offset by an increase of $85.1 million in purchases of equity securities. We purchased $135.1 million of equity securities in Morphosys and BioCryst in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to purchases of equity securities of $50.0 million related to the exercise of the Epizyme put option in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBorrowings\nIn December 2021, Biohaven announced positive topline results from the second pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The Phase 3 study achieved its co-primary regulatory endpoints of pain freedom and freedom of most bothersome symptom at 2 hours and showed broad efficacy by demonstrating statistically significant superiority to placebo across a total of 15 prespecified primary and secondary outcome measures. Biohaven plans to file an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first quarter of 2022 and other countries thereafter.\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the Adjusted Cash Receipts for each quarter and 0.25% of the value of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. The operating and personnel payments for Old RPI, an obligation of the Legacy Investors Partnerships as a non-controlling interest in Old RPI and for which the expense is reflected in our consolidated net income, are payable in equal quarterly installments and calculated as the greater of $1 million per quarter and 0.3125% of royalties from Royalty Investments (as defined in the limited partnership agreements of the Legacy Investors Partnerships) during the previous twelve calendar months.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced detailed results from the expanded Cohort 6 of the Phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic CRPC, which included patients with metastatic CRPC who had been previously treated with novel hormone therapies enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate used along with prednisone. Following discussions with FDA, Exelixis will not pursue a regulatory submission for the combination regimen based on cohort 6 of COSMIC-021. CONTACT-02, a global Phase 3 pivotal trial that initiated enrollment in June 2020 may serve as a basis for future regulatory applications.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nIn January 2022, Vertex announced that the EC granted approval for the label expansion of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients ages 6 through 11 years old who have at least onedel mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\nBackground and Format of Presentation\nFinancial highlights\n\u2022R&D Funding - We have historically funded ongoing R&D, typically for large biopharmaceutical companies, in exchange for future royalties and/or milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved. We have also made upfront R&D payments to biotechnology companies to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates.\n\u2022Aficamten. In February 2022, Cytokinetics announced positive topline results from Cohort 3 of the REDWOOD-HCM Phase 2 trial. Results from Cohort 3 showed that substantial reductions in the average resting LVOT-G as well as the post-Valsalva LVOT-G were achieved for patients with oHCM and a resting or post-Valsalva LVOT-G of \u226550 mmHg whose background therapy included disopyramide and in the majority a beta-adrenergic blocker. The safety and tolerability of aficamten were consistent with prior experience in REDWOOD-HCM with no treatment interruptions and no serious adverse events attributed to treatment reported by the investigators.\nR&D funding expense\nSources of Capital\nThe amounts and timing of forecasted expected future cash flows are largely influenced by sell-side equity research analyst coverage, commercial performance of the product and the royalty duration.\nIn October 2021, Gilead announced a collaboration with Merck & Co. to investigate Trodelvy in combination with Keytruda as a first-line treatment for people with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC.\nThe following table and analysis of cash flow changes presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur ability to satisfy our working capital needs, debt service and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants under our financing agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe following is a discussion of our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For a discussion comparing our results on a non-GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Analyst coverage. Forecasts of expected future cash flows are developed from sales projections of the underlying biopharmaceutical products as published in sell-side equity research analyst reports. In projecting future cash flows, our policy is to rely on sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for a product to derive annual sales projections for each financial royalty asset over the periods for which we are entitled to royalties or milestones. When royalty-bearing biopharmaceutical products have no coverage, limited sell-side equity research analyst coverage or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of the royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, management uses reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, market trends and management's own expertise.\nWe made distributions of $285.4 million to shareholders/unitholders prior to the IPO in June 2020. We paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $112.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 subsequent to the IPO.\nTotal income and revenues\nOther royalty income\n\u2022Tysabri - Royalty receipts from Tysabri, which is marketed by Biogen for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, increased by $23.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued patient growth.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\n\u2022In June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys AG ( MorphoSys\u201d) to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Constellation\u201d), which closed on July 15, 2021. We agreed to provide up to $2.025 billion of funding to MorphoSys, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.425 billion, additional milestone payments of up to $150 million, up to $350 million of capital ( Development Funding Bonds\u201d), which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In connection with the closing of MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, we purchased 1,337,552 ordinary shares of MorphoSys for $100 million at a price of \u20ac63.35 per ordinary share, based on the average trading price of the ordinary shares over a period preceding the closing of the acquisition.\n\nWe also have certain milestone payments that are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. As such, these contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a $100.0 million payment to Biohaven related to a development milestone that was achieved upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program.\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners. We classify our product royalty acquisitions by the following structures:\n\u2022In January 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in seltorexant from Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. for an upfront payment of $60 million and up to $95 million in additional milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. Seltorexant is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with insomnia symptoms by Johnson & Johnson.\n1. The first minority interest is attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the assets in Old RPI expire.\nOther expense/(income), net\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Flow, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates classified as Cash used in investing activities, (3) Upfront development-stage funding payments and (4) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates. This is intended to present an Adjusted Cash Flow measure that is representative of cash generated from the broader business strategy of acquiring royalty-generating assets that are available for reinvestment and for discretionary purposes.\nUpon the adoption on January 1, 2020 of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), we recorded a cumulative adjustment to Retained earnings of $192.7 million to recognize an allowance for current expected credit losses on our portfolio of financial royalty assets. The Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets reflects the activity for the period, primarily new financial royalty assets with limited protective rights and changes in the underlying cash flow forecasts used in the effective interest model to measure income from our financial royalty assets.\nWe classify our royalty acquisitions by the approval status of the therapy at the time of acquisition:\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on a non-GAAP basis. There is no direct correlation between income from financial royalty assets and royalty receipts due to the nature of the accounting methodology applied for financial royalty assets. Further, income from financial royalty assets and the provision for changes in expected cash flows related to these financial royalty assets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result, management places importance on royalty receipts as they are predictable and we use them as a measure of our operating performance. Refer to section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures and reconciliations from the most directly GAAP comparable measures of Net cash provided by operating activities.\nIn August 2021, Biogen announced results from Phase 3b NOVA study evaluation every six-week dosing with Tysabri intravenous administration in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Results show that every six-week Tysabri intravenous administration provides a high level of efficacy in controlling multiple sclerosis disease activity in patients who switched from the approved every four-week dosing regimen.\n\u2022In June 2020, we acquired a royalty on (1) Prevymis, an approved product to prevent cytomegalovirus infection in stem cell transplants, from AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH in exchange for an upfront payment of $220 million and (2) IDHIFA, an approved product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation, from Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $255 million.\nIn September 2021, Astellas Pharma and Pfizer announced that Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) reduced the risk of death by 34% compared to placebo plus ADT in the Phase 3 ARCHES study in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The primary results from the ARCHES trial were published in 2019.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in this manner requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both our reported assets and liabilities and our income and revenue and expenses. The most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of income derived from our financial royalty assets, including management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties and the expected duration of the financial royalty asset. Our cash flow forecasts are generated and updated each reporting period by manually compiling sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates for each of the products in which we own royalties. We then calculate our expected royalty cash flows using these consensus sales forecasts. In any given reporting period, any decline or increase in the expected future cash flows associated with a financial royalty asset is recognized in our income statement as non-cash provision expense or provision income, respectively.\n\u2022In March 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in the cabozantinib products Cabometyx and Cometriq from GSK for an upfront payment of $342 million and up to $50 million in additional payments contingent on the achievement of regulatory approvals of cabozantinib for prostate cancer and lung cancer in the United States and Europe.\nIn September 2020, Gilead and Immunomedics announced that Gilead would acquire Immunomedics for approximately $21 billion in cash. In 2018, we entered into a partnership with Immunomedics whereby we acquired a tiered sales-based royalty on Trodelvy for $175.0 million and acquired 4,373,178 shares of Immunomedics common stock for $75.0 million. Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics closed in October 2020, resulting in gross cash proceeds upon redemption of our Immunomedics common stock of approximately $385 million.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts increased by $328.5 million to $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, including royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise that we acquired in October 2020, fixed payments from Biohaven on the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and new assets acquired subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting the increase in royalty receipts was a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, Lyrica and Letairis. Additionally, we received one-time payments of $45.0 million related to a commercial milestone for Soliqua and $21.3 million from Avillion II in connection with the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in Adjusted Cash Receipts was further driven by a decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest, primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nIf the duration of these financial royalty assets were extended by two years by assuming the statistically projected growth trends continue and all other royalty terms and assumptions remain unchanged, any impact to interest income would not be reflected until the subsequent period and is therefore not disclosed below. However, an extended duration for a financial royalty asset could result in the reduction of any cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows, which would be recognized in the current period as provision income and is reflected in the table below for these top three financial royalty assets. If the duration for these financial royalty assets were shortened by two years by eliminating the estimated expected future cash flows for the final two years while keeping all other royalty terms and assumptions unchanged, we would recognize immediate incremental provision expense in the current period as a result of applying the prospective method of the effective interest rate methodology. The disclosure of the duration sensitivity below does not include any consideration of the related allowance for current expected credit losses. The impact of these sensitivity assumptions is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\u2022PT027. In September 2021, AstraZeneca and Avillion announced positive results from MANDALA and DENALI, two Phase 3 trials evaluating PT027 (albuterol/budesonide) in patients with asthma. PT027 is a potential first-in-class inhaled, fixed-dose combination of albuterol, a short-acting beta2-agonist, and budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid. In MANDALA, PT027 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations compared to albuterol, when used as a rescue medicine in response to symptoms. In DENALI, PT027 showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in one second, compared to the individual components albuterol and budesonide, and compared to placebo. The safety and tolerability of PT027 in both trials was consistent with the known profiles of the components. AstraZeneca has indicated PT027 regulatory submissions will occur in the first half of 2022.\nWe believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow provide meaningful information about our operating performance because the business is heavily reliant on its ability to generate consistent cash flows and these measures reflect the core cash collections and cash charges comprising our operating results. Management strongly believes that our significant operating cash flow is one of the attributes that attracts potential investors to our business.\n(1) The cystic fibrosis franchise includes the following approved products: Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio.\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested $2.7 billion in royalties and related assets across five separate transactions. While volatility exists in the quantum of our new acquisitions on a year-to-year basis due to the unpredictable timing of new investment opportunities, we have consistently deployed significant amounts of cash when measured over multi-year periods. Our approach is rooted in a highly disciplined evaluation process that is not dictated by a minimum annual investment threshold.\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $203.9 million as of December 31, 2021, which are amortized through interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt obligations.\n\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes\nVariables affecting the recognition of interest income from financial royalty assets on individual products under the prospective effective interest method include any one of the following: (1) additional acquisitions, (2) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts, (3) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (4) changes to the estimated duration of the royalty (i.e., patent expiration date) and (5) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments. Our financial royalty assets are directly linked to sales of underlying pharmaceutical products whose life cycle typically peaks at a point in time, followed frequently by declining sales trends due to the entry of generic competition, resulting in natural declines in the asset balance and periodic interest income over the life of our royalties. The recognition of interest income from royalties requires management to make estimates and assumptions around many factors, including those impacting the variables noted above.\nDevelopment-Stage Product Candidates\nAdjusted Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) Ongoing development-stage funding payments, (2) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (3) Other (including Derivative collateral posted, net of Derivative collateral received, and Termination payments on derivative instruments) and (4) Investments in non-consolidated affiliates, plus (1) Contributions from non-controlling interest- R&D, all directly reconcilable to the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT. In February 2020, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The FDA approval of Nurtec ODT triggered a redemption provision related to our investment in the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares, which entitles us to receive a fixed payment amount of $250.0 million payable in equal quarterly payments from March 31, 2021 through December 31, 2024.\n(2) In 2014, acquisitions of development-stage royalties included $3.3 billion for the acquisition of royalties on the cystic fibrosis franchise. At the time of the investment, Kalydeco was the only approved product in the franchise, while the vast majority of the value of our investment was tied to development-stage product candidates.\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of $193.2 million in upfront R&D funding and $6.9 million in ongoing R&D expenses, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi. The increase of R&D funding expense of $173.8 million, or 661.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by upfront R&D funding of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst in November 2021 and $90.0 million related to royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys in July 2021.\n\nThe RPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities were repaid in full in February 2020 and new senior secured credit facilities were issued by RPI Intermediate FT in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions.\nThe most significant assumptions used in forecasting the expected future cash flows for our royalties and requiring management's judgement include (1) estimates of the duration of the royalty, which includes consideration of the strength of patent protection and anticipated entry of generics, and (2) sales trends and product growth rates in outer years of the royalty term, which are primarily based on statistical models.\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\n\u2022In November 2021, we acquired incremental royalty interests in BCX9930 and Orladeyo (berotralstat) from BioCryst for an upfront cash payment of $150 million. Additionally, we paid $50 million to purchase 3,846 thousand shares of common stock in BioCryst, which was calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of BioCryst common stock over a period preceding the closing of the transaction. The funds from this transaction will enable further advancement of BCX9930 and support additional investment in the global launch of Orladeyo (berotralstat).\nWe have access to substantial sources of funds in the capital markets and we may, from time to time, seek additional capital through a combination of additional debt or equity financings. In June 2020, we completed our IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $86.3 million. In February 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we repaid outstanding debt held by RPIFT in full and issued new long-term debt at RPI Intermediate FT. In September 2020, we repaid in full our senior secured credit facilities entered into in February 2020 using the proceeds of the 2020 Notes in addition to cash on hand. In July 2021, we issued an additional $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have a Revolving Credit Facility which provides for borrowing capacity of up to $1.5 billion that remains undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total long-term debt outstanding of $7.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nOur portfolio consists of royalties on more than 35 marketed therapies and ten development-stage product candidates. The therapies in our portfolio address therapeutic areas such as rare disease, cancer, neurology, infectious disease, hematology and diabetes, and are delivered to patients across both primary and specialty care settings. The table below includes royalty receipts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in order of contributions to royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nBelow is a summary of the sensitivity of our current year results in relation to the royalty duration for our top three financial royalty assets based on net carrying value as of December 31, 2021. Because these are long-dated financial royalty assets, we have assumed a change of two years in the estimated duration to sensitize the financial statement impact. The effect of a change in estimated duration is the factor that would have the most significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations. There have not been any significant changes to the estimated duration of expected future cash flows for our top three financial royalty assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, with the exception of the cystic fibrosis franchise due to the FDA approval of Trikafta in 2019, which extended the expected duration at that time.\n\u2022movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\nIn April 2021, BioCryst announced that the EC approved Orladeyo for the prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older.\n(1) Development stage royalties include: direct R&D funding arrangements and funding arrangements executed through our joint venture partnership with the Avillion Entities, investments in development-stage product candidates, and investments in securities primarily made in connection with acquisitions of royalties on development stage products from the seller.\nIn June 2021, Gilead announced superior outcomes to standard of care in second-line treatment of metastatic TNBC in the Phase 3 ASCENT study. Trodelvy more than doubled overall survival as a second-line treatment in the new ASCENT subgroup analysis.\n\u2022Otilimab. GlaxoSmithKline has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the contRast trials in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2022.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nDistributions to Non-Controlling Interest\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on recently issued accounting standards.\n\u2022In March 2020, we acquired a royalty on Entyvio, an approved product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, from The General Hospital Corporation in exchange for an upfront payment of $86.6 million.\nIn December 2020, the FDA expanded the eligibility for Trikafta to include people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older with certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nFollowing our IPO, we operate and control the business affairs of Royalty Pharma Holdings Ltd, ( RP Holdings\u201d) through our controlling ownership of RP Holdings' Class A ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class A Interests\u201d) and RP Holdings' Class B ordinary shares (the RP Holdings Class B Interests\u201d). We include RP Holdings and its subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements. RP Holdings is the sole owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, which is an Irish collective asset management entity formed to facilitate our Exchange Offer Transactions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nR&D funding expense consists of upfront and ongoing R&D payments we have made to counterparties to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates. Ongoing R&D payments are made as the related development-stage product candidates undergo clinical trials with our counterparties. These expenditures relate to the activities performed by our counterparties to develop and test new products, to test existing products for treatment in new indications, and to ensure product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.\nAdjusted Cash Flow increased by $283.7 million to $1.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily for the same reasons noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).\u201d The adjustments between Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\u201d and Adjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\u201d increased by $39.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 30, 2020. The increase was driven by a $31.8 million increase in net interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a shift to semi-annual interest payments on the 2020 Notes and a $16.1 million one-time payment related to the settlement of treasury rate lock contracts in connection with the 2021 Notes issuance. This increase was partially offset by lower ongoing development-stage funding requirements under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi and lower funding requirements by the Avillion entities in 2021 following the cessation of our involvement in the Merck KGaA Asset development in 2020.\n\u2022Cabometyx. In January 2021, Exelixis announced that the FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a first-line treatment in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo. The approval was based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER trial, in which the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo significantly improved overall survival while doubling progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC.\nIn July 2021, we entered into an amended agreement with Avillion II to increase our investment from $105.0 million to $122.5 million over multiple years to fund a portion of the costs for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of Avillion II, which is a party to a co-development agreement with AstraZeneca to advance PT027 through a global clinical development program for the treatment of asthma in exchange for royalties, a series of success-based milestones, and other potential payments.\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nLegacy SLP Interest\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise - Royalty receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, which includes Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio, which are marketed by Vertex for patients with certain mutations causing cystic fibrosis, increased by $150.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the performance of Trikafta in the United States, including its rapid uptake in children 6 through 11 years old and the launch of Kaftrio in Europe. The year ended December 31, 2021 also benefited from a clawback adjustment related to Vertex's agreement with French authorities around reimbursement for Orkambi, which had reduced royalty receipts in the three months ended March 31, 2020 by approximately $41 million (to reflect a true-up in prior periods where we collected royalties on sales in France at a higher selling price). Following our acquisition of the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the three months ended December 31, 2020, we are entitled to all royalty receipts on annual worldwide net sales above $5.8 billion. We received royalty receipts related to the residual interest in the cystic fibrosis franchise in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn December 2017, our equity method investee Avillion Financing I, LP ( Avillion I\u201d) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of a supplemental New Drug Application for Pfizer's Bosulif to expand its label into front-line chronic myeloid leukemia, which triggered a series of contractual fixed payments from Pfizer to Avillion I over a 10-year period, which we recognize through receipt of Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay $320 million to acquire from Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. a royalty on the European sales of Crysvita, an approved product for the treatment of x-linked hypophosphatemia, a rare genetic orphan disease that has a profound impact on bone development in adults and children, subject to certain caps.\nIn August 2021, Exelixis announced that their partners Takeda and Ono received approval in Japan for Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic RCC. Approval is based on the CheckMate -9ER trial of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo, which demonstrated superior overall survival and doubled mean progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib, with a favorable safety profile.\n\u2022Pelabresib: In December 2021, MorphoSys presented the latest data from the Phase 2 MANIFEST study evaluating pelabresib in the treatment of myelofibrosis. As of September 10, 2021, the data cut-off, a total of 84 JAK inhibtor-naive patients were enrolled and received the first-line combination of pelabresib and ruxolitinib. The data showed 68% (n=57) of patients treated with the combination achieved a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume (SVR35) from baseline at week 24 and 60% (n=47) maintained SVR35 at week 48. Most patients also saw their symptoms reduced, with 56% (n=46) achieving greater than or equal to 50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline at week 24.\nSubsequent to our IPO, net income attributable to non-controlling interest includes the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships and will include net income attributable to the Class C Special Interest held by EPA Holdings once certain conditions have been met. Future net income attributable to the non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares.\n*Represents less than 10%.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts (non-GAAP)\n\u2022In January 2022, we acquired a royalty interest in aficamten from Cytokinetics, Incorporated ( Cytokinetics\u201d) for $150.0 million comprised of an upfront payment of $50 million and two additional $50 million payments, conditional upon the initiation of potential pivotal clinical trials for oHCM and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Additionally, we will provide Cytokinetics long-term capital of up to $300 million ( Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding\u201d) to support potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and further development of aficamten. The Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding is available in five tranches, including an initial tranche of $50 million funded upon closing and four additional tranches in the aggregate amount of $250 million to be funded upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and clinical development milestones.\nIn February 2022, Cytokinetics announced that FDA has accepted and filed the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for omecamtiv mecarbil. The FDA assigned the NDA a standard review with a PDUFA target action date of November 30, 2022. The FDA also indicated that it is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The submission is supported by GALACTIC-HF, which demonstrated a positive effect on the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who were receiving standard of care plus omecamtiv mecarbil.\nWe recorded equity in losses of non-consolidated affiliates of $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates of 44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022HIV franchise - Royalty receipts from the HIV franchise, which is based on products marketed by Gilead that contain emtricitabine, including Biktarvy, Genvoya and Truvada, among others, decreased by $215.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven by the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion and $581.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.0 billion and $983.3 million, respectively. We intend to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash and cash equivalents, sales of marketable securities, future cash flows from operations or the issuance of additional debt. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the sales of the underlying pharmaceutical products in which we hold royalties, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. Currently, we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives.\nIncluded below is a table of investment activity over each of the last ten years based on the type of investment at the acquisition date. Amounts presented in the table below reflect cash paid at the acquisition date; any associated contractual payments are reflected in the period in which cash was paid.\nOther royalty income increased by $34.1 million, or 179.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by increased income from Nurtec ODT and Trodelvy that arose from our R&D funding agreements with Biohaven and Immunomedics, respectively. Other royalty income in the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes income from the HIV franchise, a fully amortized financial royalty asset, and Letairis, which was also fully amortized, but for which we expect minimal residual royalty income.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures presented as supplemental measures to our GAAP financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. In each case, because our operating performance is a function of our liquidity, the non-GAAP measures used by management are presented and defined as supplemental liquidity measures. We caution readers that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of Adjusted Cash Receipts, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies. Not all companies and analysts calculate the non-GAAP measures we use in the same manner. We compensate for these limitations by using non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by presenting the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures, in each case being Net cash provided by operating activities.\nAs the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the value of the Legacy SLP Interest is expected to decline over time. Our equity method investee, the Legacy Investors Partnerships, also owns a non-controlling interest in Old RPI.\nIn January 2021, Orladeyo was approved in Japan, becoming the first and only prophylactic HAE medication approved in the region.\n\u2022In October 2020, we acquired the residual royalty interest in Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise owned by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The agreement includes an upfront payment of $575 million and a potential milestone payment of $75 million.\n\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, we acquired an equity method investment from the Continuing Investors Partnerships in the form of a special limited partnership interest in the Legacy Investors Partnerships (the Legacy SLP Interest\u201d) in exchange for issuing shares in our subsidiary. The Legacy SLP Interest entitles us to the equivalent of performance distribution payments that would have been paid to the general partner of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and a performance income allocation on a similar basis. The performance income allocation attributable to us is equal to the general partner's former contractual rights to the income of the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nOur borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nUses of Capital\nIn June 2021, Exelixis and Ipsen announced that COSMIC-312, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The trial met one of its primary endpoints by demonstrating significant improvement in progression-free survival at the planned primary analysis. However, a prespecified interim analysis was not statistically significant for the second primary endpoint of overall survival. Based on the preliminary overall survival data, Exelixis anticipates that the probability of reaching statistical significance at the time of the final analysis is low.\n(3) The HIV franchise includes the following approved products: Atripla, Truvada, Emtriva, Complera, Stribild, Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey, Symtuza and Biktarvy. Royalties are received on the emtricitabine portion of sales only.\nIn 2019, we entered into an amended agreement with BAv Financing II, LP ( Avillion II\u201d, or, together with Avillion I, the Avillion Entities\u201d), to invest $19.0 million to fund approximately 50% of the costs of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the use of Merck KGaA's anti-IL 17 nanobody M1095 (the Merck KGaA Asset\u201d) for the treatment of psoriasis in exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments. During 2020, our involvement in the development for the Merck KGaA Asset ceased. We do not expect to record significant earnings or losses in the future related to this investment.\nPortfolio Overview\nIn August 2020, Vertex announced that the EC had granted marketing authorization of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older with onedel mutation and one minimal function mutation, or twodel mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total provision expense of $452.8 million, of which $465.8 million and $12.9 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision income for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for Tazverik, Imbruvica, Emgality and the cystic fibrosis franchise, primarily due to significant declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Tysabri. The current expected credit loss activity in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in provision income that was primarily driven by a significant decrease in current expected credit losses related to Tazverik as a result of the corresponding significant decline in the financial asset value. This was partially offset by provision expense for credit losses recognized as a result of the increases to our portfolio of financial royalty assets with limited protective rights, primarily related to zavegepant from a $100.0 million funding payment we made to Biohaven upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program and a new royalty interest in Cabometyx/Cometriq.\nIn April 2021, Vertex announced EC approval for Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have at least onedel mutation.\nIn June 2021, Phase 3 GLOW study results for Imbruvica in combination with Venetoclax for the treatment of first-line CLL and SLL demonstrated superior progression-free survival versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab as a first-line treatment of CLL. The study also showed improved duration of remission and significantly improved depth of remission. AbbVie has indicated that approval could occur in 2022.\nR&D funding expense\nOther operating expenses\nFinancial Overview\nTotal income and other revenues is primarily comprised of income from our financial royalty assets, royalty revenue from our intangible royalty assets, and royalty income arising from successful commercialization of products developed through joint R&D funding arrangements. Most of our royalties on both approved products and development-stage product candidates that are not accounted for as R&D funding expense are classified as financial assets as our ownership rights are generally passive in nature. In instances in which we acquire a royalty that does include more substantial rights or ownership of the underlying intellectual property, we classify such royalties as intangible assets.\n\u2022Evrysdi. In August 2020, the FDA approved Evrysdi, the first at-home, orally administered treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children ages 2 months and older.\nIn June 2021, we announced a long-term strategic funding partnership with MorphoSys to support MorphoSys' acquisition of Constellation, which closed on July 15, 2021. As part of the partnership, we agreed to provide MorphoSys up to $350 million of Development Funding Bonds, which MorphoSys may draw over a one-year period from the close of its acquisition of Constellation. MorphoSys is required to draw a minimum of $150 million of Development Funding Bonds. In return, we expect to receive a return of 2.2 times the amount funded on the Development Funding Bonds payable on a quarterly basis over nine years, with the first payment beginning two years after the funding. As of December 31, 2021, MorphoSys has not drawn any amount under the Development Funding Bonds.\nDistributions to Shareholders/Unitholders\nIn connection with our IPO, we consummated an exchange offer on February 11, 2020 (the Exchange Date\u201d). Through the exchange offer, investors representing 82% of the aggregate limited partnership in the various partnerships owned by Old RPI (the Legacy Investors Partnerships\u201d), exchanged their limited partnership interests in the Legacy Investors Partnerships for limited partnership interests in RPI US Partners 2019, LP, a Delaware limited partnership or RPI International Holdings 2019, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (together, the Continuing Investors Partnerships\u201d). The exchange offer transaction together with (i) the concurrent incurrence of indebtedness under a new credit facility and (ii) the issuance of additional interests in Continuing Investors Partnerships to satisfy performance payments payable in respect of assets acquired prior to the date of the IPO are referred to as the Exchange Offer Transactions.\u201d\n\u2022Research & Development ( R&D\u201d) Funding - We have historically funded ongoing R&D, typically for large biopharmaceutical companies, in exchange for future royalties and/or milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved. We have also made upfront R&D payments to biotechnology companies to acquire royalties and/or milestones on development-stage product candidates.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $323.7 million to $1.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the factors noted above in Adjusted Cash Receipts (Non-GAAP).\u201d Payments for operating and professional costs, the only adjustment between Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted EBITDA, increased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher Operating and Personnel Payments under the terms of our Management Agreement offset by a decrease in non-recurring professional services fees, restructuring fees and refinancing fees incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and the IPO.\n\u2022Commercial performance. The approval of a product for use in new indications can extend the date through which we are entitled to royalties or milestones on that product. For certain financial royalty assets, such as the cystic fibrosis franchise, we are entitled to royalties on approved combination products and may be entitled to royalties on future combination products, which, once approved, create new cash flow streams which were not initially contemplated and whose sales were previously not reflected in expected future cash flows. We generally do not recognize income from, or forecast sales for, unapproved products or indications. If a product is removed from all or a portion of a market, subsequent sell-side equity research analysts' forecasts will reflect the expected drop in sales. Both the new cash flow streams and the cessation of cash flow streams related to a product's performance in the market over the royalty term can materially affect our forecast of expected future cash flows.\n\u2022M&A - We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of biopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also seek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire biopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nGuarantor Financial Information\n\u2022Imbruvica. In April 2020, Imbruvica received FDA approval for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\n\u2022In April 2021, we acquired a royalty interest in Oxlumo from Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront cash payment of $180 million and up to $60 million in contingent sales-based milestone payments. Oxlumo, which has been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1, is marketed by Alnylam.\nIn December 2021, Cytokinetics announced the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for aficamten for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM based on results from REDWOOD-HCM. Cytokinetics has indicated it plans to initiate a pivotal study of aficamten in oHCM in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn May 2021, Biohaven announced that the FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the preventative treatment of migraine, indicated for adult patients with episodic migraine who experience less than 15 headache days per month.\nThe remaining 34% of RPCT is owned by the Legacy Investors Partnerships and Royalty Pharma Select Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPSFT\u201d), which is wholly owned by Royalty Pharma Select, an Irish unit trust. From the Exchange Date until the expiration of the Legacy Investors Partnerships' investment period on June 30, 2020 (the Legacy Date\u201d), the Legacy Investors Partnerships had the option to participate proportionately in any investment made by Old RPI. Following the Legacy Date, Old RPI ceased making new investments and each of Old RPI and the Legacy Investors Partnerships became legacy entities. Following the Legacy Date, we have made and plan to make new investments solely through our subsidiaries.\n\u2022In December 2020, we acquired royalty interests from BioCryst on (1) Orladeyo (berotralstat) to support the launch of the product in hereditary angioedema (HAE) and (2) its development stage Factor D inhibitor BCX9930 in exchange for an upfront cash payment of $125 million.\nFactors Impacting Expected Future Cash Flows\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nOther income, net of $219.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily comprised of net gains on equity securities of $247.1 million, of which $292.3 million was driven by the redemption of our investment in Immunomedics common stock upon Gilead's acquisition of Immunomedics in October 2020 and $66.0 million was related to an increase in share price of our investment in Biohaven common shares. These gains were partially offset by a loss of $120.1 million related to a decrease in share price of our investment in Epizyme common stock. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized $42.1 million in losses on our derivative financial instruments, primarily related to Epizyme warrants as a result of the decrease in Epizyme common stock price. Additionally, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $30.5 million related to the debt refinancings completed in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRefer to the section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d for additional discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures as supplemental financial measures.\nRoyalty Pharma plc is an English public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales that was created for the purpose of consolidating our predecessor entities and facilitating the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of our Class A ordinary shares that was completed in June 2020. Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma plc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. After the consummation of the Exchange Offer Transactions (as defined below) and execution of the Management Agreement (collectively, the Reorganization Transactions\u201d) in February 2020 and before the consummation of the IPO, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV ( RPI 2019 ICAV\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Royalty Pharma,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Royalty Pharma Investments, an Irish unit trust ( Old RPI\u201d).\nIn addition, we believe that Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow help identify underlying trends in the business and permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company, including planning and forecasting for future periods. Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, voluntary debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures help management, the audit committee and investors evaluate our ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\nNet income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships, which arose in February 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions, was $266.6 million and $321.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships reflects a partial period of net income subsequent to the Exchange Date in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships was primarily driven by lower net income attributable to Old RPI in 2021.\n\u2022Nurtec ODT - Royalty receipts from Nurtec ODT, marketed by Biohaven and Pfizer for the acute treatment of migraine, were $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, as a result of the approval of Nurtec ODT in February 2020, we received $62.5 million in fixed payments from Biohaven in the year ended December 31, 2021, which represent the first four of 16 consecutive quarterly payments to be received from Biohaven relating to the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares.\nThe Avillion Entities\nIn June 2021, Vertex announced that FDA approved Trikafta for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis ages 6 through 11 who have at least onedel mutation or have certain mutations that are responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro data.\nAs a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions, we own, through our subsidiary RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPI Intermediate FT\u201d), an 82% economic interest in Old RPI. Through our 82% indirect ownership of Old RPI, we are legally entitled to 82% of the economics of Old RPI's wholly-owned subsidiaries, RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPIFT\u201d) and RPI Acquisitions (Ireland), Limited ( RPI Acquisitions\u201d), an Irish private limited company, and 66% of Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, a Delaware statutory trust ( RPCT\u201d).\nThe provision for changes in expected future cash flows from financial royalty assets includes the following:\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to pay up to $330 million to purchase a royalty owned by Eisai, on future worldwide sales outside Japan of Tazverik (tazemetostat), a novel targeted therapy in late-stage clinical development with the potential to be approved in several cancer indications. We acquired a portion Eisai's future worldwide royalties on net sales by Epizyme of Tazverik outside Japan, for an upfront payment of $110 million plus up to an additional $220 million for the remainder of the royalty upon FDA approval of Tazverik for certain indications. The FDA approved Tazverik in January 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma which triggered our obligation to fund the second $110 million tranche in November 2020. In June 2020, the FDA approval of additional indications triggered our recognition of a liability for the final tranche of $110.0 million, which was paid in November 2021.\n\nKey developments and upcoming events relating to our portfolio\n\u2022Promacta - Royalty receipts from Promacta, which is marketed by Novartis for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, increased by $29.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This growth was primarily driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia in the United States.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in Net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that our existing capital resources, cash provided by operating activities and our Revolving Credit Facility will continue to allow us to meet our operating and working capital requirements, to fund planned strategic acquisitions and R&D funding arrangements, and to meet our debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. We have historically operated at a low level of fixed operating costs. Our primary cash operating expenses, other than R&D funding commitments, include interest expense, our Operating and Personnel Payments, and legal and professional fees.\nThe royalty duration is important for purposes of accurately measuring interest income over the life of a financial royalty asset. In making assumptions around the royalty duration for terms that are not contractually fixed, management considers the strength of existing patent protection, expected entry of generics, geographical exclusivity periods and potential patent term extensions tied to the underlying product. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing for the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations.\nOther expense/(income), net primarily includes the change in fair market value of our equity securities and the unrealized (gains)/losses on our available for sale debt securities, including related forwards and derivatives. Other expense/(income), net also includes losses on extinguishment of debt and interest income.\nEven though we believe interest income from financial royalty assets and the associated non-cash provision for changes in future cash flows are not indicative of our near-term financial performance and should not be used as a source for predicting future income or growth trends, changes in the aforementioned assumptions could result in a material impact to our financial statements. A shortened royalty term can result in a reduction in interest income, significant reductions in total royalty payments over time compared to expectations or a permanent impairment. If the effective interest rate is lower for the current period than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected) this would result in the immediate recognition of non-cash provision expense even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. Changes in sell-side equity research analyst consensus sales forecasts directly impact future interest income and recognition of any provision income or expense in a similar manner.\nManagement uses Adjusted Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate cash and performance of the business and to evaluate the Company's performance as compared to its peer group. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income measures used by many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, even though each company may customize its own calculation and therefore one company's metric may not be directly comparable to another's. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Cash Flow, are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets is derived from sales of Januvia, Janumet and other DPP-IV products by our licensees.\n(2) Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs include the following approved products: Tradjenta, Onglyza, Kombiglyze, Galvus, Eucreas and Nesina. The Other DPP-IVs are marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Takeda.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Certain of these policies are considered critical as they have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of income and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe made distributions of $739.3 million to unitholders in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022In August 2020, we entered into an expanded agreement with Biohaven for up to $450 million to fund the development of zavegepant and the commercialization of Nurtec ODT. Biohaven received an upfront payment of $150 million at closing and received an additional $100 million payment in March 2021 upon the start of the oral zavegepant Phase 3 program. We will receive a royalty on Nurtec ODT and zavegepant and success-based milestone payments based on zavegepant regulatory approvals. We are also committed to provide further support for the ongoing launch of Nurtec ODT through the purchase of committed, non-contingent Commercial Launch Preferred Equity (defined below) for a total of $200 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In return, Biohaven will pay a series of equal fixed payments from the three months ended March 31, 2025 through the three months ended December 31, 2030.\nOur most critical accounting policies relate to our financial royalty assets and the full descriptions can be found in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the most significant judgments and estimates applied by management are associated with the measurement of our financial royalty assets at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method. The application of the prospective approach to calculate interest income from our financial royalty assets requires management's judgment in forecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties. These estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events.\nIn November 2021, Biohaven announced a strategic collaboration with Pfizer for the commercialization of rimegepant outside the United States. Pfizer also gains rights outside the U.S. to zavegepant, which is being studied in an intranasal delivery and an oral formulation in Phase 3 clinical trials for migraine indications.\n4. The fourth minority interest is attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT as a result of a 2011 reorganization transaction. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and is expected to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\n\u2022Third-party Royalties - A royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee's use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current portfolio consists of third-party royalties.\nIn March 2021, Biohaven announced that it enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant for the preventive treatment of migraine. Accordingly, per the agreement with Biohaven announced in August 2020, Royalty Pharma paid $100 million to Biohaven for the achievement of this milestone, bringing the total zavegepant funding to $250 million.\nFinancing activities\nBiohaven has indicated it expects an EMA decision on Vydura (rimegepant) in the first half of 2022.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded total provision expense of $230.8 million, of which $74.7 million and $156.2 million related to provision expense for changes in expected cash flows and provision expense for current expected credit losses, respectively. We recorded provision expense for IDHIFA, which was acquired in the year ended December 31, 2020, and for Imbruvica and Tysabri due to declines in sell-side research analysts' consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense was partially offset by provision income from a significant increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts for Xtandi. We recognized provision expense for current expected credit losses as a result of our adoption of the new accounting standard in the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision expense for current expected credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven primarily by certain additions to our portfolio of financial royalty assets, including the additional tranche of Tazverik and our acquisition of the zavegepant royalty.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, which is derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\n\nOur obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RP Holdings, a non-wholly owned subsidiary (the Guarantor Subsidiary\u201d). Our remaining subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d) do not guarantee the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, Royalty Pharma plc and the Guarantor Subsidiary each fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee the payment of interest, principal and premium, if any, on the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the par value and carrying value of the total outstanding and guaranteed Notes was $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced that the FDA granted an accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either a programmed death receptor-1 or a programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor. The accelerated approval was based on data from the international Phase 2, single-arm TROPHY study.\nThe fourth non-controlling interest related to ownership in RPCT held by RPSFT, is the only non-controlling interest that existed prior to the Exchange Offer Transactions and is reflected in our financial statements through December 31, 2019. The non-controlling interest related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' 18% ownership interest in Old RPI is reflected in our financial statements from and after the Exchange Date. The other two non-controlling interests are reflected in our financial statements from and after the date of our IPO. All of the results of operations of RP Holdings, Old RPI and RPCT are consolidated into our financial statements.\n\u2022Cabometyx/Cometriq - Royalty receipts from Cabometyx/Cometriq, which is marketed by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda, were $33.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Cabometyx/Cometriq royalty in March 2021.\n\u2022Omecamtiv mecarbil. In November 2020, Amgen, Cytokinetics and Servier presented the results of GALACTIC-HF study, a Phase 3 trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure, at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. The trial met the primary composite endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure events, but did not meet the secondary endpoint of reduction in cardiovascular death. Cytokinetics subsequently regained global rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil when Amgen and Servier elected to terminate their collaboration agreement effective, May 2021. Following the Phase 3 results and termination of the collaboration, we wrote off the full value of our financial royalty asset given the uncertainty around the future of omecamtiv mecarbil.\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we made a $100 million investment in Epizyme. In exchange for an upfront payment of $100 million, we received (1) shares of Epizyme common stock, (2) a warrant to purchase an additional 2.5 million shares of Epizyme common stock at $20 per share over a three-year term and (3) Epizyme's royalty on sales of Tazverik in Japan payable by Eisai. We also lowered Epizyme's royalty on Tazverik above certain sales thresholds and granted Epizyme an 18-month put option to sell an additional $50 million of its common stock to RPIFT at then-prevailing prices, not to exceed $20 per share. Epizyme exercised its put option on December 30, 2019, which resulted in Epizyme issuing RPIFT 2.5 million shares on settlement in February 2020.\n*Percentage change is not meaningful.\n(4) Includes royalty receipts for Nurtec ODT of $7.7 million and quarterly redemptions of $15.6 million of the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares (presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows) for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount also includes a payment from Biohaven in respect of an expired option to exercise additional funding of the Biohaven Series A Preferred Shares which is presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs the former activity is a combination of income and expense items, the provision breakdown by product, exclusive of the provision for current expected credit losses, is as follows, based on the largest contributors to each year's provision income or expense:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5) Other products primarily include royalties on the following products: Bosulif (a product co-developed by our joint venture investee, Avillion, for which receipts are presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows), Lexiscan, Soliqua, Nesina, Cimzia, Letairis, Entyvio, Myozyme, Mircera and Lyrica. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a one-time milestone payment of $45.0 million that we received on Soliqua. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a one-time $21.3 million distribution from Avillion in respect of the Merck KGaA Asset for which the receipt is presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates in both the operating and investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Date, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest.\nIn June 2021, Evrysdi was approved in Japan for the treatment of SMA.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Receipts (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCash flows\nIn November 2021, Gilead announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Trodelvy as a monotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for advanced disease. The EC's decision is supported by results from the Phase 3 ASCENT study, where Trodelvy reduced the risk of death by 49% and improved median overall survival to 11.8 months versus 6.9 months with physician's choice of chemotherapy.\nThe following financial information presents summarized combined balance sheet financial information as of December 31, 2021, and summarized combined statement of operations information for the year ended December 31, 2021 for Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings. All intercompany balances and transactions between Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings are eliminated in the presentation of the combined financial statements. RP Holdings' most significant asset is its investment in operating subsidiaries, which has been eliminated in the table below to exclude investments in Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries hold the majority of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and financial royalty assets. As a result, our ability to make required payments on the Notes depends on the performance of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. There are no material restrictions on distributions from the operating subsidiaries. Amounts presented below do not represent our total consolidated amounts as of December 31, 2021 or for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Development-Stage Product Candidates - We acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates that have demonstrated strong clinical proof of concept. From 2012, when we began acquiring royalties on development-stage product candidates, through 2021, we have deployed $7.8 billion to acquire royalties on development-stage product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses include primarily Operating and Personnel Payments, legal expenses, other expenses for professional services and share-based compensation. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nOther royalty income includes primarily income from financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized by the expected expiry date and royalty income from synthetic royalties arising out of R&D funding arrangements. Occasionally, a royalty asset may be amortized on an accelerated basis due to collectability concerns, which, if resolved, may result in future cash collections when no financial royalty asset remains. Similarly, we may continue to collect royalties on a financial royalty asset beyond the estimated patent expiration date by which the financial asset was amortized in full. In each scenario where a financial royalty asset has been fully amortized, income from such royalty is recognized as Other royalty income.\n(a)Dates shown represent our estimates as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K of when a royalty will substantially end, which may depend on clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, contractual terms, commercial developments, our estimates of patent expiration dates (which may include estimated patent term extensions) or other factors and may vary by geography. There can be no assurances that our royalties will expire when expected.\nG&A expenses\nIn connection with our IPO, Royalty Pharma plc became a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in RP Holdings, which is the sole equity owner of RPI 2019 ICAV, an entity that is included in our consolidated financial statements. We report non-controlling interest related to four minority interests in our subsidiaries held by third parties.\n\u2022the movement in the cumulative allowance for changes in expected future cash flows; and\n(b)Royalty is perpetual; year shown represents Trikafta expected patent expiration and potential sales decline based on timing of generic entry.\n(3) The HIV franchise includes the following approved products: Atripla, Truvada, Emtriva, Complera, Stribild, Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey, Symtuza and Biktarvy. Royalties are received on the emtricitabine portion of sales only.\nOther operating expenses were $65.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge related to the write-off of our omecamtiv mecarbil financial royalty asset balance of $90.2 million, net of cumulative allowance of $25.2 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, it was announced that omecamtiv mecarbil, a development stage product, did not meet the clinical trial objectives. There was no comparable activity in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n3. The third minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class B Interests held indirectly by the Continuing Investors Partnerships, which represent an approximate 29% ownership interest in RP Holdings as of December 31, 2021 and are exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own the RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A ordinary shares. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 44,763 thousand RP Holdings Class B Interests were exchanged for our Class A ordinary shares.\n\u2022expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020.\nOur operations have historically been financed primarily with cash flows generated by our royalties. Due to the nature of our accounting methodology for our financial royalty assets, there is no direct correlation between our income from royalties and our royalty receipts. As noted above, income from such royalties is measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method accounting methodology. Given the importance of cash flows and their predictability to management's operation of the business, management uses royalty receipts as the primary measure of our operating performance. Royalty receipts refer to the summation of the following line items from our GAAP Statement of Cash Flows: Cash collections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates.\n\nThe Avillion entities (as defined below) partner with global biopharmaceutical companies to perform R&D in exchange for success-based milestones and/or royalties once products are commercialized.\nOngoing investment in new royalties is fundamental to the long-term prospects of our business. New investments provide a source of growth for our royalty receipts, supplementing growth within our existing portfolio and offsetting declines for products in our portfolio that have lost market exclusivity. We evaluate an array of royalty acquisition opportunities on a continuous basis and expect to continue to make acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business. Our team has established a strong track record of identifying, evaluating and investing in royalties tied to leading products across therapeutic areas and treatment modalities. We invest in approved products and development-stage product candidates that have generated robust proof of concept data. We invest in these therapies through the purchase of royalties, by making hybrid investments and by acquiring businesses with significant existing royalty assets or the potential for the creation of such assets.\n(c)Under terms of the agreement, RPIFT acquired a perpetual royalty on net sales of Tysabri. Management has applied an end date of 2031 for purposes of accreting income over the royalty term, which is periodically reviewed.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future principal and interest payments under our Notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nSummary of royalty acquisition activity\nWe have historically funded our acquisition program through free cash flow, equity contributions and debt. Our low operating costs coupled with a lack of capital expenditures and low taxes have contributed to our strong financial profile, resulting in high operating leverage and high conversion of our Adjusted Cash Receipts to Adjusted Cash Flow. We expect to continue funding our current and planned operating costs (excluding acquisitions) principally through our cash flow from operations and our acquisition program through cash flow and issuances of equity and debt. In the past, we have supplemented our available cash and cash equivalents on hand with attractive debt capital to fund certain strategic acquisitions.\n(4) Includes royalty receipts for Nurtec ODT of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and quarterly redemptions of $15.6 million of the Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares (presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows) in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount also includes a payment from Biohaven in respect of an expired option to exercise additional funding of the Biohaven Series A Preferred Shares which is presented as Proceeds from available for sale debt securities on the Statement of Cash Flows in 2020.\n\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nGilead has indicated that it expects progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of overall survival data from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 trial in hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative metastatic breast cancer in March 2022.\nPrior to the Exchange Date, operating and personnel payments were fixed and grew at 5% annually and were not linked to any financial line item.\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nDistributions to non-controlling interest decreased by $64.3 million to $479.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which positively impacted Adjusted Cash Receipts. The decrease in distributions to non-controlling interest is primarily due to a decline in royalty receipts from maturing assets, primarily the HIV franchise, and a non-recurring distribution to the Legacy Investors Partnerships made in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these decreases was a distribution to non-controlling interest related to the one-time milestone payment we received on Soliqua in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn January 2022, Gilead announced it has entered into two clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with Merck & Co. to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As part of the collaboration, Merck will sponsor a global Phase 3 clinical trial of Trodelvy in combination with Keytruda as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the companies recently established an agreement whereby Gilead will sponsor a Phase 2 signal-seeking study evaluating combinations that include pembrolizumab in first-line NSCLC.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Reporting\nWe paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $285.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We do not have a legal obligation to pay a quarterly dividend or dividends at any specified rate or at all.\nIn March 2021, Ipsen announced that the EC approved the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC.\n\nThe key developments impacting our cash receipts and income and revenue from our royalty interests are discussed below:\nG&A expenses were relatively flat in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs include the following approved products: Tradjenta, Onglyza, Kombiglyze, Galvus, Eucreas and Nesina. The Other DPP-IVs are marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Takeda.\nOverview\nWe recognize interest income related to our financial royalty assets. Royalty revenue relates solely to revenue from our DPP-IV patent estate for which the patent rights have been licensed to various counterparties. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the royalty payors accounting for greater than 10% of our total income and other revenues in any one year are shown in the table below:\nInvestments Overview\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes RPSFT's 20% share of earnings in RPCT, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Old RPI. We expect net income attributable to this non-controlling interest to decline over time as the royalty assets owned by RPCT expire and to be substantially eliminated by the end of 2022.\nOn February 11, 2020, in connection with the Exchange Offer Transactions and using funds contributed by RPI Intermediate FT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships, RPIFT repaid its outstanding debt and accrued interest, and terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps. RPI Intermediate FT, as borrower, entered into a term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto from time to time and the other parties thereto. In September 2020, we repaid in full the outstanding principal amounts of term loans under the senior secured credit facilities with the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes and available cash on hand.\nAcquisitions of royalties\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest expense\nSignificant Assumptions Applied in Developing Forecasted Expected Future Cash Flows\nOther Funding Arrangements\nResults of Operations\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within the Company's credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the assessment of our liquidity.\n\u2022Adjusted Cash Flow (a non-GAAP metric) totaled $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn July 26, 2021, we issued $1.3 billion of the 2021 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.80% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $36.4 million, paid semi-annually. On September 2, 2020, we issued $6.0 billion of the 2020 Notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.125% and requiring annual interest payments of approximately $127.5 million, paid semi-annually. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes offering, together with available cash on hand, to repay in full the senior secured credit facilities. Indentures governing the Notes contain certain covenants, which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2021.\nNet income attributable to RPSFT was $57.6 million and $88.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect net income attributable to RPSFT to continue to decline as the royalty assets owned by RPCT mature.\n\u2022Trodelvy. In April 2020, Immunomedics announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.\nDebt service\nIncome from financial royalty assets by product for our top products for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows, in order of contribution to income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Xtandi - Royalty receipts from Xtandi, which is marketed by Pfizer and Astellas for the treatment of prostate cancer, increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by demand across various prostate cancer indications.\nOther royalty income\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nAdjusted Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\nR&D funding expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $20.5 million in ongoing development-stage funding payments, primarily under our co-funding agreement with Sanofi, and $5.8 million in upfront funding related to a royalty on a development-stage product that we acquired from BioCryst.\nOther expense, net of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily comprised of net losses on equity securities of $48.1 million, including losses on MorphoSys ordinary shares and Epizyme common stock, partially offset by a gain on Biohaven common shares; and losses of $21.5 million on our derivative financial instruments related to our treasury rate lock contracts that were unwound and settled in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. The losses were partially offset by interest income of $50.9 million related to our Series A Biohaven Preferred Shares and a gain of $17.9 million on the unrealized change in fair value of our available for sale debt securities.\nThe provision for changes in expected cash flows is the current period activity resulting from adjustments to the cumulative allowance for changes in expected cash flows, which is netted against the non-current portion of Financial royalty assets, net balance on the consolidated balance sheets. As discussed above, income is accreted on our financial royalty assets using the effective interest method. As we update our forecasted cash flows on a periodic basis and recalculate the present value of the remaining future cash flows, any shortfall when compared to the carrying value of the financial royalty asset is recorded directly to the income statement through the line item Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets. If, in a subsequent period, there is an increase in expected cash flows or if actual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously expected, we reduce the cumulative allowance previously established for a financial royalty asset for the incremental increase in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. This results in provision income (i.e., a credit to the provision).\n\nIn March 2021, Roche announced that the EC approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in patients two months of age and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four splicing modifier of motor neuron 2 copies.\nRevenue from intangible royalty assets\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nTo arrive at Adjusted EBITDA, we start with Net cash provided by operating activities and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments and (5) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase of $187.4 million in upfront R&D funding and an increase of $27.2 million in interest paid. The increase was driven by upfront R&D funding payments of $103.2 million related to an additional royalty on a development-stage product acquired in connection with our expanded funding agreement with BioCryst and $90.0 million related royalties on two development-stage products acquired from MorphoSys. The increase in interest paid was primarily due to the shift from quarterly to semi-annual interest payments with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, for which we did not make any interest payments on the 2020 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in cash collections from financial royalty assets of $193.9 million.\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nWe are the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry. Since our founding in 1996, we have been pioneers in the royalty market, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies. We have assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles us to payments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry's leading therapies, which includes royalties on more than 35 commercial products, including AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson's Imbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer's Xtandi, Biogen's Tysabri, Johnson & Johnson's Tremfya, Gilead's Trodelvy, Merck's Januvia, Novartis' Promacta, Vertex's Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta, and ten development-stage product candidates. We fund innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly - directly when we partner with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when we acquire existing royalties from the original innovators.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we acquired the following: (1) a royalty on Promacta, an approved product for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, from Ligand Pharmaceuticals in exchange for an upfront payment of $827 million, (2) a royalty on Lilly's Emgality, an approved product for the treatment of migraine, from Atlas Ventures and Orbimed for $260 million and (3) a royalty on Johnson & Johnson's Erleada, an approved product for the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Regents of the University of California for $105.4 million and potential future milestones.\n\u2022Cystic fibrosis franchise. In October 2019, Vertex received approval from the FDA for Trikafta for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis ages 12 years and older who have at least one copy of thedel mutation.\nTo arrive at Adjusted Cash Receipts, we start with the GAAP line item, Net cash provided by operating activities, and adjust for the following items from the Statement of Cash Flows: to add back (1) Proceeds from available for sale debt securities (primarily the redemption of Biohaven Preferred Shares), which are cash inflows that management believes are derived from royalties and form part of our core business strategy, (2) Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates which are cash inflows from investing activities, (3) Interest paid, net of Interest received, (4) Development-stage funding payments, (5) Payments for operating and professional costs, (6) Payments for rebates and (7) Termination payments on derivative instruments, and to deduct (1) Distributions to non-controlling interest, which represents distributions to our historical non-controlling interest attributable to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by certain legacy investors and to a new non-controlling interest that was created as a result of the Exchange Offer Transactions in February 2020 related to the Legacy Investors Partnerships' ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI and (2) Derivative collateral posted or (received), net, both of which are excluded when management assesses its operating performance through cash collections, or, Adjusted Cash Receipts.\n\u2022Approved Products - We acquire royalties in approved products that generate predictable cash flows and may offer upside potential from unapproved indications. Since inception in 1996 through 2021, we have deployed $15.0 billion of cash to acquire royalties on approved products. From 2012 through 2021, we have acquired $10.2 billion of royalties on approved products.\nInvesting activities\nThe breakdown of our provision for changes in expected future cash flows includes the following:\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nFollowing the IPO, EPA Holdings is entitled to receive Equity Performance Awards through its RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. Equity Performance Awards owed to EPA Holdings will be recognized as an equity transaction when the obligation becomes due and will impact the income allocated to non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest at that time. We do not currently expect any material Equity Performance Awards to be payable until certain performance conditions are met, which we do not expect to occur until the mid-2020s.\n2. The second minority interest is attributable to the RP Holdings Class C ordinary share (the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest\u201d) held by RPI EPA Holdings, LP ( EPA Holdings\u201d), an affiliate of the Manager. Income will not be allocated to this non-controlling interest until certain conditions are met.\nIn May 2021, Exelixis announced results from cohort six of COSMIC-021, a Phase 1b trial evaluating Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In high-risk patients, the combination of Cabometyx and atezolizumab resulted in objective response rates of 27% and 18% per investigator assessment and Blinded Independent Radiology Committee, respectively.\n\u2022In July 2020, we acquired a royalty on risdiplam, a development-stage product for the treatment of Types 1, 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) from PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in exchange for an upfront payment of $650 million. Evrysdi (risdiplam) was subsequently approved by the FDA in August 2020, representing the first, oral treatment approved for infants, children and adults with all SMA types.\nIn August 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL. This milestone marked the 11th FDA approval for Imbruvica since it was first approved in 2013 and sixth in CLL.\n\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2019, we entered into a preferred share purchase agreement with Biohaven through which we purchased $125 million in Series A Preferred Shares, providing us with a fixed return on redemption of two times our investment on FDA approval of Biohaven's pipeline product, Nurtec ODT, for migraine treatment. The FDA approved Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults in February 2020.\nOur financial royalty assets represent investments in cash flow streams with yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest method. We calculate the effective interest rate using forecasted expected cash flows to be received over the life of the royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. Interest income is recognized at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the asset, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively. As changes in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales estimates are updated on a quarterly basis, the effective rate of return changes. For example, if sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increase, the yield to derive income on a financial royalty asset will increase and result in higher income for subsequent periods.\nIn December 2021, Alnylam submitted a supplemental New Drug Application for lumasiran to the FDA and a Type II Variation with the EMA for the reduction of plasma oxalate in the treatment of patients with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results\n(1) The cystic fibrosis franchise includes the following approved products: Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio.\n\n\u2022Tremfya - Royalty receipts from Tremfya, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson, were $35.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We acquired the Tremfya royalty in July 2021.\nWe evaluate financial royalty assets for impairment on an individual basis by comparing the effective interest rate at each reporting date to that of the prior period. If the effective interest rate for the current period is lower than the prior period, and if the gross cash flows have declined (expected and collected), management records a provision for the change in expected cash flows. The provision is measured as the difference between the financial royalty asset's amortized cost basis and the net present value of the expected future cash flows, calculated based on the prior period's effective interest rate. The amount recognized as provision expense increases the financial royalty asset's cumulative allowance, which reduces the net carrying value of the financial royalty asset.\n\u2022Tysabri. In April 2021, Biogen announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for a subcutaneous injection of Tysabri to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Biogen also announced that it had received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for its sBLA for subcutaneous Tysabri. The Complete Response Letter indicates that the FDA is unable to approve Biogen's filing as submitted. Biogen announced that it is evaluating the Complete Response Letter and will determine next steps in the United States.\nAdjusted Cash Receipts and Adjusted Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of our ability to generate cash from operations. Both measures are an indication of the strength of the Company and the performance of the business. Management also uses Adjusted Cash Flow to compare its performance against non-GAAP adjusted net income used by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Adjusted EBITDA, as derived from Adjusted Cash Receipts, is used by our lenders to assess our ability to meet our financial covenants.\nAs of and following the Exchange Date, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest also includes the Legacy Investors Partnerships' approximately 18% share of earnings in Old RPI. As the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the related net income attributable to this non-controlling interest is expected to decline over time.\nEquity in earnings of the Legacy SLP Interest was $8.9 million and $62.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity in losses of the Avillion Entities was $28.4 million and $17.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdditionally, in April 2021, we entered into an agreement with MSCI Inc. ( MSCI\u201d), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services where we will assist MSCI to design a classification framework and index methodologies which will expand MSCI's thematic index suite with the launch of new indexes. In return, we will receive a portion of MSCI's revenues from those indexes. The financial statement impact associated with this transaction was not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Zavegepant. In December 2019, Biohaven announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine.\nAs a result of the non-cash charges associated with applying the effective interest method accounting methodology, our income statement activity in respect of many of our royalties can be volatile and unpredictable. Small declines in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts over a long time horizon can result in an immediate non-cash income statement expense recognition, even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many years into the future. For example, in late 2014 we acquired the cystic fibrosis franchise royalty, which is classified as a financial royalty asset. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, declines in near-term sales forecasts of sell-side equity research analysts caused us to recognize non-cash provision expenses to the income statement and build up a corresponding cumulative allowance which reduced the gross balance for this financial royalty asset. Over the course of 10 quarters, we recognized non-cash provision expenses as a result of these changes in forecasts including non-cash provision expense of $743.2 million in 2016, ultimately reaching a peak cumulative allowance of $1.30 billion by September 30, 2017 related to this financial royalty asset. With the approval of the Vertex triple combination therapy, Trikafta, in October 2019, sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts increased to reflect the larger addressable market and the extension of the expected duration of the Trikafta royalty. While small reductions in the cumulative allowance for the cystic fibrosis franchise were recognized as provision income in 2017 and 2018, there remained a $1.10 billion cumulative allowance that was fully reduced by $1.10 billion recognized in 2019 as a result of an increase in sell-side equity research analysts' consensus sales forecasts associated with the Trikafta approval. This example illustrates the volatility caused by our accounting model. Therefore, management believes investors should not look to income from royalties and the associated provision for changes in future cash flows as a measure of our near-term financial performance or as a source for predicting future income or growth trends.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nAstellas and Pfizer have indicated that there could be a potential readout of the Phase 3 EMBARK trial for high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer in the second half of 2022.\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities is the closest comparable GAAP financial measure to the supplemental non-GAAP liquidity measures that follow.\n(5) Other products primarily include royalties on the following products: Bosulif (a product co-developed by our joint venture investee, Avillion, for which receipts are presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates on the Statement of Cash Flows), Lexiscan, Soliqua, Nesina, Cimzia, Letairis, Entyvio, Myozyme, Mircera and Lyrica. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a one-time milestone payment of $45.0 million that we received on Soliqua. Other products for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a one-time $21.3 million distribution from Avillion in respect of the Merck KGaA Asset (defined below) for which the receipt is presented as Distributions from non-consolidated affiliates in both the operating and investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the Exchange Offer Transactions, other products also includes contributions from the Legacy SLP Interest (defined below).\nCash provided by financing activities decreased by $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the $1.9 billion net proceeds received from our IPO in June 2020. Offsetting the decreases in cash provided by financing activities were net proceeds of $1.3 billion from issuance of 2021 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the net proceeds of $727.9 million related to the debt refinancings in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating activities\n\nThe table below includes the royalty receipts and non-GAAP financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by product in order of contribution to royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Cash Flow are similar non-GAAP liquidity measures that are both most closely comparable to the GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA is important to our lenders and is defined under the Credit Agreement as Adjusted Cash Receipts less Payments for operating and professional costs. Payments for operating and professional costs are comprised of Payments for operating and professional costs and Payments for rebates from the Statement of Cash Flows.\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Purchase Agreement ( Series B Biohaven Preferred Share Agreement\u201d) with Biohaven where we committed to acquire 3,992 shares of Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares at a price of $50,100 per preferred share (the Commercial Launch Preferred Equity\u201d), for a total of $200.0 million payable on a quarterly basis from the three months ended March 31, 2021 through the three months ended December 31, 2024. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we began purchasing the Series B Biohaven Preferred Shares and have a remaining commitment of $129.6 million under our Commercial Launch Preferred Equity as of December 31, 2021.\nIn May 2021, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the EC approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\n\u2022Synthetic / Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product for which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\n(1) We began recognizing income related to Trodelvy in the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nIncome from financial royalty assets increased by $105.1 million, or 5.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the performance of the cystic fibrosis franchise, including additional interest income attributable to the residual royalty interest that we acquired in the three months ended December 31, 2020. We also recorded $57.0 million in income in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to newly acquired assets in 2021, primarily Cabometyx/Cometriq, Tremfya and Oxlumo. The increase in income was partially offset by declines from the maturity of our royalties from the HIV franchise.\nRoyalty Receipts\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nEquity in losses/(earnings) of non-consolidated affiliates\nIn August 2021, AbbVie announced that the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware had issued a decision holding patent rights relating to Imbruvica were valid and infringed by a generic product from Alvogen and Natco. The decision, which is subject to appeal, prohibits regulatory approval of that generic product until the last AbbVie patent expires. Previously, AbbVie entered into several settlement and license agreements with other generic companies. Consequently, AbbVie does not expect any generic product entry prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted.\n\u2022Synthetic/Hybrid Royalties - A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales created by the developer and/or marketer of a therapy in exchange for funding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments, or be structured as a long-term stream of fixed-payments with a predetermined schedule. In many of our synthetic royalties, we may also make investments in the public equity of the company, where the main value driver of the company is the product on which we concurrently acquired a royalty.\nOperating and Personnel Payments\nBelow we discuss the key drivers of royalty receipts.\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n\u2022Imbruvica - Royalty receipts from Imbruvica, which is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease, increased by $30.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by continued global penetration in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by modest market share losses in the United States, lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of COVID-19 inventory stocking.\nOther expense/(income), net\nIn April 2021, Gilead announced the FDA granted full approval to Trodelvy for adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for metastatic disease. The approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 ASCENT study.\nRefer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for additional discussion of the Notes and our debt refinancings in 2020.\nExelixis has indicated it expects Phase 3 data from the COSMIC-313 trial in 1L RCC in the first half of 2022 and initial Phase 3 data in the second half of 2022 from CONTACT-01 in metastatic NSCLC and CONTACT-03 in advanced or metastatic RCC.\nRPIFT Senior Secured Credit Facilities\nWhile we classify our acquisitions in these two broad categories, several of our acquisitions of royalties on approved products were driven by the long-term potential of these products in other, unapproved indications. Similarly, some of our royalty acquisitions in development-stage product candidates are for products that are approved in other indications.\nIn September 2021, Exelixis announced FDA approved Cabometyx for patients with previously treated radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. The approval was based on the Phase 3 COSMIC-311 pivotal trial.\nOur capital-efficient business model enables us to benefit from many of the most attractive characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry, including long product life cycles, significant barriers to entry and noncyclical revenues, but with substantially reduced exposure to many common industry challenges such as early stage development risk, therapeutic area constraints, high research and development costs, and high fixed manufacturing and marketing costs. We have a highly flexible approach that is agnostic to both therapeutic area and treatment modality, allowing us to acquire royalties on the most attractive therapies across the biopharmaceutical industry.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, most of the royalties we acquire are treated as investments in cash flow streams and are thus classified as financial assets. These investments have yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized cost under the effective interest accounting methodology. Under this accounting methodology, we calculate the effective interest rate on each financial royalty asset using a forecast of the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the financial royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. The yield, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively, is then recognized via accretion into our income at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the financial royalty asset.\nTotal income and other revenues\n\u2022Januvia, Janumet, Other DPP-IVs - Royalty receipts from the DPP-IVs for type 2 diabetes, which includes Januvia and Janumet, both marketed by Merck & Co., increased $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Xtandi. In December 2019, Astellas and Pfizer announced that the FDA approved Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer.\nWe have other funding arrangements where we are contractually obligated to fund R&D activities performed by our development partners and to provide additional capital related to our equity method investment in the Avillion entities. As our committed capital requirements are based on phases of development, the completion of which is highly uncertain, only the capital required to fund the current stage of development under such funding arrangements is considered committed capital requirements which approximate $41.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Oxlumo. In July 2021, Alnylam announced results from ILLUMINATE-C, a Phase 3 open-label study of lumasiran in patients of all ages with advanced primary hyperoxaluria type 1 associated with progressive decline in renal function. Results from the primary analysis at six months demonstrated a substantial reduction in plasma oxalate from baseline in patients with advanced disease, including those on hemodialysis. The safety and tolerability profile of lumasiran following six months of treatment was encouraging across all ages, with no drug related serious adverse events and injection site reactions as the most common adverse event.\nWhen royalty-bearing pharmaceutical products have limited or no coverage by sell-side equity research analysts, or where sell-side equity research analyst estimates are not available for the full term of our royalty, particularly for the later years in a product's life, we generally incorporate a statistical curve developed using historical sales data and available consensus sales projections to forecast product sales over the remaining life of the product. In cases where the statistical curve is not used, we use reasonable judgment to make assumptions about the growth or decline in the sales of these products based on historical data, publicly available information for the marketer, industry data and market trends and our own expertise.\nBusiness Overview\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\u2022Orladeyo. In December 2020, BioCryst announced that Orladeyo was approved by the FDA for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ages 12 years and older.\nWe acquire product royalties in a variety of ways that can be tailored to the needs of our partners.
