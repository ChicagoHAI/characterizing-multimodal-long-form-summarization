If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase,\u201d decrease,\u201d grew,\u201d declined,\u201d was up,\u201d was down,\u201d was flat,\u201d or was similar\u201d refer to a comparison with the prior year unless otherwise stated.\nUnderstanding Our Company\nKey Business Characteristics\nWe offer an extensive line of products and services for individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors and other participants in the private capital markets. Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements. As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services. We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook Data, through license agreements. Our license agreements typically range from one to three years. We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions. These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.\nOur investment management products have multiple fee structures, which vary by client and region. In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios. For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two. Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees. In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter. Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.\nIn our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures. We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements. Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.\nWe also generate transaction-based revenue, including the sale of advertising on our websites and sponsorship of conferences. In our credit ratings business, we primarily generate revenue through our provision of ratings on new issues of securities.\nDeferred Revenue\nWe invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers. We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities) at the end of 2018. For 2017, the amount of deferred revenue was $185.5 million (of which $171.3 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\nSignificant Operating Leverage\nOur business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content. While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low. This reflects our business focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management. At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results. During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate. When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.\nOperating Expense\nWe classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below. We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.\n\u2022 Cost of revenue. This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers. For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports. It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products. In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects. This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category. Cost of revenue also includes other expenses such as third-party data purchases and data lines.\n\u2022 Sales and marketing. This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and marketing professionals. We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.\n\u2022 General and administrative. This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments. It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.\n\u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Our capital expenditures are mainly for capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements. We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter. We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years. We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.\nInternational Operations\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements. We account for certain minority-owned investments in international locations, including Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) and Sustainalytics Holding B.V. (Sustainalytics), using the equity method.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\nWhen our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars. Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.\nOur goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders. We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts, but may not build long-term shareholder value.\nWe provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:\n\u2022 Revenue (including organic revenue);\n\u2022 Operating income (loss); and\n\u2022 Free cash flow.\nOrganic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nWe define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations. We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business. We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture. For adoption of accounting changes, we exclude the effects of the adoption for the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018, as prior period results have not been adjusted. Organic revenue is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business. Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity. Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTo evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods. For subscription-based products, we calculate a retention rate based on the number of subscriptions retained during the year as a percentage of the number of subscriptions up for renewal. For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period. We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify. We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the actual revenue for the previous comparable fiscal period as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage. The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2019.\nThe Year 2018 in Review\nWe continually monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry. We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.\nVolatility characterized global equity markets in 2018, as the prospect of trade wars shook global economic expectations, a decade's worth of low-interest rates began reversing, and political uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe further impacted the outlook. The Morningstar U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, hit a record high on September 20, 2018, then fell 14.6% by year-end. This index finished 2018 with a full-year loss of 5.1%, ending a run that lasted the better part of a decade. International equities fared even worse, as Morningstar's Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished 2018 down 13.7%, with the Developed Markets ex-U.S. Index down 13.9% and the Emerging Markets Index down 13.2%.\nRising interest rates, especially at the long end of the yield curve, along with widening corporate bond credit spreads hampered fixed-income returns in 2018. Over the course of the year, the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds rose 27 basis points. The total annual return for Morningstar's Core Bond Index (our broadest measure of the fixed-income universe) was essentially unchanged for the year. Breaking the overall index down, Morningstar's Short-Term Core Bond Index rose approximately 1.5% and the Intermediate Core Bond Index rose 0.9%, but these gains were offset by the Long-Term Core Bond Index, which fell 3.2%.\nBased on Morningstar Asset Flows data, U.S. fund assets, composed of both long-term open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaled about $17.0 trillion as of December 31, 2018, compared with over $18.1 trillion as of December 31, 2017. Ending the year at approximately $3.4 trillion in assets under management, the U.S. ETF industry remained largely flat year-over-year, as market declines slightly offset investor inflows. In contrast, assets under management in U.S. long-term open-end funds declined to $13.6 trillion from $14.7 trillion in the prior year due to both market declines and investor outflows. In 2018, investors continued to favor passively-managed vehicles, with net inflows of more than $457.0 billion for passively managed funds and ETFs.\nAlthough actively-managed vehicles in aggregate experienced over $303.0 billion of outflows in 2018, most of the decline came from actively-managed U.S. equity mutual funds. Actively-managed ETFs attracted almost $27 billion of investor flows through 2018.\nBased on PitchBook Platform data, on an aggregated basis, U.S. private capital markets experienced record performance in 2018, as evidenced by many different metrics. Over $713 billion worth of private equity-backed transactions were recorded across an estimated 4,828 completed deals, setting a record for the number of completed deals in a year. The total deal-value figure represented the second-highest yearly figure PitchBook has ever reported. In addition, despite significant volatility in various asset classes, valuations across private equity and M&A remained stable.\nThe U.S. venture capital market also set a record in 2018 for the most capital ever invested in a single year. Driven by record amounts of capital invested in financing rounds of at least $100 million, roughly $131 billion in capital was invested. Over $55 billion in capital was raised by new vehicles, representing a 62.7% year-over-year increase and setting a record for the most capital raised in a single year. European markets also experienced a surge in total capital deployed by venture capital investors. Driven by an increase in the median deal size across all investment stages, over \u20ac20.5 billion was raised by European-headquartered startups in 2018, the largest figure in at least a decade.\nRegulatory Environment\nIn addition to industry developments in 2018, there are several longer-term regulatory trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.\nIn the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally. Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and \"whole of market\" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013. The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors. The U.K. regulator is monitoring the implementation of RDR and is scheduled to publish a review of its findings in 2019. In addition to the RDR, the U.K. regulator and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) launched the Financial Advice Market Review (FAMR) in 2015 in light of concerns that the market for financial advice was not working well for consumers. FAMR aimed to explore ways in which the government, industry, and regulators could take collective steps to stimulate the development of a market, which delivers affordable and accessible financial advice and guidance to everyone. FAMR's final report, published in March 2016, set out 28 recommendations intended to tackle barriers to consumers accessing advice. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HMT will review the outcomes of FAMR in 2019.\nIn the United Kingdom, the FCA will also publish the final report of its Platforms Market Study in 2019. The Study explores the value offered, competition and whether the relationships between platforms, advisers, asset managers and fund ratings providers work in the interests of investors. Also, as of September 2019, U.K. fund managers must appoint a minimum of two independent directors to their boards and conduct an annual assessment of the value that they deliver to investors. These new rules are borne from the regulators Asset Management Market Study that sought to ensure fund managers compete on the value they deliver and act in the interests of investors.\nIn the European Union, the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), became effective in January 2018. The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.\nWith respect to indexes, European Union Benchmarks Regulation 2016/1011 came into force on June 30, 2016 with a majority of its provisions having a compliance date of January 1, 2018. The principal objective of the Regulation is to ensure benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (e.g., a tracking index of a ETF) are free of conflicts of interest, are used appropriately and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure. This Regulation applies to Morningstar's index group as a result of making available its indexes to European investable product sponsors (e.g., ETF sponsors) as the tracking index for their investable product.\nThe European Commission announced its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance in May 2018. The proposed amendments would adjust the Benchmarks Regulation to create a new category of low-carbon and positive carbon benchmarks as well as change MiFID II to include ESG preferences in the advice they offer to investors. The Plan also proposed new regulations on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and risks and on the establishment of a unified classification system on what can be considered an environmentally sustainable economic activity.\nIn Australia, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has been investigating banking and wealth management businesses. In a final report issued on February 1, 2019, the commission did not recommend the elimination of vertically integrated wealth management business models but has proposed a tighter set of rules around such vertical integration to make it more difficult to inappropriately incentivize the sale of financial products through aligned distribution channels. In particular financial advisers will be required to disclose to a client why they are not independent, impartial and unbiased before providing advice. The commission has also recommended a stronger regulatory presence with the imposition of more fines and an increase in enforcement litigation. The fund management industry also continues to be an area of regulatory reform with the introduction of the Asia Region Funds Passport and Corporate Collective Investment Vehicle Schemes, the review of fees and costs disclosure for managed investment and superannuation funds, and a suite of seven new and updated regulatory guides for the fund management industry.\nIn the U.S., the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) new fiduciary standard that would have expanded the definition of a fiduciary for certain financial advisors who provide advice related to retirement planning was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in March 2018. The new rule was previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017. In April 2018, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest\u201d and may finalize this rule in 2019. Regulation Best Interest echoes many of the principals of the DOL's rule, although it does not contain the same types of bright-line prohibitions on certain kinds of compensation, nor expose advisors to class-action lawsuits.\nRegulators in the financial services industry have indicated they are increasingly concerned by risk factors related to senior management accountability, data protection and privacy, and cybersecurity. For example, jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, and Singapore have adopted or are considering the adoption of more stringent rules that will require that specific individuals be identified as responsible for certain senior management functions and will hold a firm's senior management team personally accountable for their own and their firm's actions and conduct. Data privacy regulation continues to proliferate, as various jurisdictions such as the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Brazil, and the State of California join the European Union in adopting comprehensive data privacy regulation. Since operations in the financial services industry require the processing of significant amounts of personally identifiable information (PII), we believe the burdens of regulation, and possibly inconsistent regulation, will proliferate. As a related matter, issues of cybersecurity as they relate to the identification and mitigation of system vulnerabilities should also grow in prominence as services rendered by the industry become increasingly digital over time. For example, the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations has indicated that its 2019 examination programs will prioritize cybersecurity with an emphasis on, among other things, proper configuration of network storage devices, information security governance, and policies and procedures related to retail trading information security.\nWe believe these regulatory tends will continue in financial markets worldwide.\nSupplemental Operating Metrics (Unaudited)\nThe tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td>

estimated traffic on Morningstar.com using a combination of internal tools and a third-party platform. The new website launched in the first quarter of 2018 now allows tracking of 100% of website traffic using a third-party platform. The Company believes the current reporting is a more accurate representation of traffic, and this change in methodology is the primary driver of the difference in reported traffic numbers versus 2017.\n(2) The asset totals shown above (including assets we either manage directly or for which we provide consulting or subadvisory work) only include assets for which we receive basis-point fees. Some of our client contracts include services for which we receive a flat fee, but we do not include those assets in the total reported.\nExcluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.\nAside from Morningstar Managed Portfolios, it's difficult for our Investment Management business to quantify these cash inflows and outflows. The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period. We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.\n(3) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals. The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.\n(4) 2017 and 2016 amounts are revised to include assets from Australia, which were previously reflected in Institutional Asset Management. 2016 was also revised to include assets from South Africa.\n(5) The 2017 decline was due to client losses related to a strategic shift away from our customized investment management offerings to Managed Portfolios. Also, 2017 and 2016 numbers were revised to exclude Australia and South Africa assets, which are reflected in Morningstar Managed Portfolios.\n(6) Excludes $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion of assets under advisement and management related to Manager Selection Services as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that were reclassified to Morningstar Data. The associated revenue is included in Morningstar Data.\n(7) Revised to exclude temporary employees and part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week.\n(8) Key product and investment area revenue and revenue by type includes the effect of foreign currency translations.\n(9) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Data revenue during 2018 by $1.5 million.\n(10) Restated from prior periods due to realignment of individual products within the product groups.\n(11) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Investment Management revenue during 2018 by $5.0 million.\n(12) Morningstar did not acquire full ownership of PitchBook until December 2016; therefore 2016 results reflected one month of operations.\n(13) Excluding the negative 6.5 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 9.7% for the full year in 2017. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018.\n(14) License-based revenue includes Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Enterprise Components, Morningstar Research, PitchBook Data, and other similar products. License-based revenue during 2018 included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement.\n(15) Asset-based revenue includes Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Indexes.\n(16) Transaction-based revenue includes Morningstar Credit Ratings, Internet advertising sales, and Conferences.\nConsolidated Results\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key Metrics (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>911.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(274.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(188.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(157.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(227.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\npp - percentage points\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.

Foreign currency movements increased revenue by $4.0 million in 2018 and had no net material impact on revenue in 2017.\nWe experienced strong revenue growth across all revenue types during 2018.\nLicense-based revenue grew 12.6% during 2018. We experienced continued demand for license-based products, such as PitchBook Data, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct. Revenue from PitchBook Data increased by $36.0 million due primarily to strong sales of new licenses and high renewal rates. The number of PitchBook Platform licenses increased to 22,979 at the end of 2018, compared with 13,908 at the end of 2017 and 9,723 at the end of 2016. Morningstar Data revenue increased by $19.1 million in 2018, as result of adding new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients by adding additional datasets primarily within our managed products and market data product lines.\nRevenue from Morningstar Direct rose $13.5 million in 2018, reflecting growth in licenses for both new and existing clients and certain price increases. The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 15,033 worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 13,884 at the end of 2017 and 12,492 at the end of 2016, with growth in both the U.S. and internationally.\nDuring 2018, licensed-based revenue also included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement recorded in the third quarter.\nAsset-based revenue increased 10.0% during 2018, primarily driven by Morningstar Managed Portfolios and Workplace Solutions. The adoption of Topic 606 favorably impacted asset-based revenue growth by 2.7 percentage points during 2018. See Note 18 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 18) for additional information. Morningstar Investment Management revenue increased $10.2 million during 2018 due to growth in Morningstar Managed Portfolios offset by declines in institutional asset management. Workplace Solutions revenue increased 2.4% during 2018. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture in 2017, Workplace Solutions revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018. The asset-based revenue we earn in both Morningstar Investment Management and Workplace Solutions is generally based on average asset levels during each quarter. Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $200.1 billion in 2018, compared with $206.2 billion in 2017 and $192.0 billion in 2016.\nTransaction-based revenue grew 9.8% during 2018, driven by Morningstar Credit Ratings and ad sales on Morningstar.com. Morningstar Credit Ratings completed 138 new-issue ratings, primarily of structured finance securities, representing a 49.2% increase in the asset value of the issues rated during 2018 compared to 2017.\nSome of the main contributors to the 2017 revenue increase were PitchBook Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Credit Ratings.\nOrganic revenue\nTo allow for more meaningful comparisons of our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations. In 2018, we divested our 15(c) board consulting services product line and did not make any significant acquisitions. We also adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, which had a favorable impact on revenue. In 2017, we divested HelloWallet and did not make any acquisitions.\nWe exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period.\nForeign currency translation had a favorable effect of $4.0 million on revenue in 2018. Our 2017 results included revenue of $6.1 million from our divestitures of HelloWallet and our 15(c) board consulting services product line, which did not recur in 2018. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted revenue by $6.7 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios. See Note 18 for additional information. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 11.4% in 2018.\nIn 2017, we had $57.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook. Revenue in 2016 included $4.4 million of revenue from HelloWallet, which we divested in the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the second half of 2017. Revenue from PitchBook was treated as acquired revenue through November 2017 and was incorporated into organic growth statistics after December 1, 2017. Because HelloWallet was divested in the second quarter of 2017, we excluded HelloWallet's last six months of 2016 revenue from our organic revenue growth calculation. In addition, foreign currency translations had no net material impact on revenue in 2017. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 7.6% in 2017.\nThe tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 vs. 2017 (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>911.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: adoption of accounting changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>905.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016 (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>911.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: adoption of accounting changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nNMF - Not meaningful\nOrganic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.

The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.\nInternational organic revenue increased 9.2% during 2018. Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Managed Portfolios were the main contributors to the organic international growth. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted international revenue by $6.4 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios in Australia. See Note 18 for additional information.\nIn 2017, international organic revenue increased 8.0%.\nRenewal Rates\nAs discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.\nThe graph below illustrates our retention metrics over the past five years for contract-based products and services, primarily Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, PitchBook, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office.\nFor these contract-based products and services, we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 100% in 2018, compared with 102% in 2017. The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes; increasing client bases upon contract renewal; changes to the contract value upon renewal (such as increased users); and changes in the value of variable-fee contracts. These factors, therefore, can lead to a renewal rate percentage over 100%.\nConsolidated Operating Expense\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>386.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>804.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, operating expense increased $62.2 million, or 8.4%. Foreign currency translations increased our operating expense by $2.6 million in 2018.\nCompensation expense (which primarily consists of salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $33.4 million in 2018. Salary expense increased by $17.4 million, primarily driven by higher headcount at PitchBook. We accrued higher bonus expense of $16.5 million in 2018 due to stronger performance against our internal targets.\nProduction expense increased $9.7 million in 2018, related primarily to our adoption of Topic 606. See Note 18 for additional information. Depreciation expense increased $8.4 million in 2018, driven mainly by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development incurred over the past several years. Stock-based compensation expense increased $7.7 million in 2018 due to stronger performance against our incentive plan targets as well as accelerated vesting related to retirement or service provisions.\nOffsetting these expenses in 2018 was an increase in capitalized software development of $7.2 million. Lower intangible amortization of $2.9 million also offset the increase in expenses in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized. Commission expense also decreased $2.9 million as a result of the adoption of Topic 606.\nWe had 5,416 employees worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 4,920 in 2017. This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including operations in India and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn 2017, our operating expense increased $124.1 million, or 20.1%. Foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $0.6 million in 2017.\nHigher compensation expense, depreciation expense, professional fees, and sales commission expense were the main drivers that contributed to the increase in operating expense in 2017.\nCompensation expense increased $65.5 million in 2017 with bonus expense increasing $18.7 million. Bonus expense was higher due to stronger performance against our internal targets. Depreciation expense in 2017 included a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy.\nPartially offsetting our 2017 total operating expense increase was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. In 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million of software development expense compared to $28.2 million of software development expense in 2016.\nWe had 4,920 employees worldwide at the end of 2017, compared with 4,550 in 2016. This increase reflected continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including data operations in India and China and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services. We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.\nCost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 6.3%, in 2018. Higher compensation expense of $15.8 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $9.8 million. Higher production expense also contributed to the unfavorable variance in this category and includes $6.7 million of expense related to our adoption of Topic 606. See Note 18 for additional information.\nHigher internally developed capitalized software partially offset these increases. Continuous focus on development of our major software platforms, coupled with bringing new products and capabilities to market, resulted in an increase in capitalized software development, which in turn reduced operating expense. During 2018, we capitalized $53.5 million associated with software development activities, mainly related to enhanced capabilities in our products, internal infrastructure, and software, including PitchBook, Morningstar Cloud Platform, and Morningstar Enterprise Components. In comparison, we capitalized $46.3 million in 2017.\nCost of revenue increased $42.3 million in 2017. Higher compensation expense of $36.1 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $12.0 million. Professional fees and production expense also contributed to the increase in this category.\nPartially offsetting these increases was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. We accelerated development of our major software platforms, resulting in an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense. During 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million, associated with software development activities, mainly related to PitchBook, Morningstar Data, Workplace Solutions, and additional enhancements to reporting, financial planning, and other capabilities in our products. In comparison, we capitalized $28.2 million in 2016.\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2018 and 0.7 percentage points in 2017.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $14.2 million, or 10.6%, in 2018, reflecting a $11.8 million increase in compensation expense. Offsetting this increase was a decrease of $2.9 million in commission expense that is now being capitalized as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Advertising and marketing spend also decreased $1.1 million during 2018 due to a shift in strategy and mix of spend related to greater use of digital channels versus direct mail campaigns.\nSales and marketing expense increased $36.7 million in 2017. Compensation expense increased $21.2 million due primarily to higher headcount at PitchBook. Sales commission expense also increased $12.6 million during 2017.\nAs a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was flat in 2018 and increased 2.5 percentage points in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $18.0 million, or 13.9%, during 2018. Compensation expense increased $5.8 million during 2018 with bonus expense increasing $2.9 million. Stock-based compensation increased $5.1 million due to accelerated vesting related to retirement or service provisions and more equity awards granted. Rent expense increased $2.1 million and software subscriptions increased $2.1 million during 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $24.6 million, or 23.3%, during 2017. Compensation expense increased $8.2 million due to higher headcount at PitchBook. Stock-based compensation increased $6.3 million, primarily for management bonus plan expense related to PitchBook during 2017. Rent expense and software subscriptions also contributed to the increase in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was flat in 2018 and 1.0 percentage point in 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOverall, depreciation and amortization increased $5.5 million, or 6.0%, in 2018 and $20.5 million, or 28.9%, in 2017.\nDepreciation expense rose $8.4 million in 2018, mainly driven by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development incurred over the past several years. Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.9 million in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.\nDepreciation expense rose $16.3 million in 2017 from higher depreciation expense related to capitalized software development and computer equipment incurred over the past several years. Depreciation expense during 2017 also included a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy. Intangible amortization expense increased $4.2 million in 2017 due to additional amortization expense for the intangible assets of PitchBook offset by certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions that are now fully amortized.\nWe expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost. We estimate that this expense will total approximately $19.2 million in 2019. Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and foreign currency translation.\nConsolidated Operating Income and Operating Margin\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated operating income increased $46.0 million in 2018 as revenue increased $108.2 million and operating expense increased $62.2 million.

The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, changing to a territorial tax system and imposing a transitional tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective from January 1, 2018.\nIn response to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the complexity in accounting which allowed SEC registrants to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the Tax Reform Act within the one-year measurement period required by SAB 118.\nWe are also subject to additional provisions of the Tax Reform Act effective from January 1, 2018.\nRefer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and the amounts that we recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, and for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate.\nOur effective tax rate in 2018 was 20.7%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 23.9% in 2017, primarily due to the 2018 tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act and also because of updates to our provisional tax estimates recorded in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate in 2017 was 23.9%, a decrease of 4.4 percentage points compared with 28.3% in 2016, primarily because of the provisional tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $395.9 million, up $42.6 million from the end of 2017. The increase reflects cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds of $15.5 million related to the sale and purchase of investments, and proceeds of $10.5 million related to the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018. The sale of a portion of an equity-method investment also generated proceeds of $7.9 million. These items were partially offset by $110.0 million of repayments of long-term debt, $76.1 million of capital expenditures, dividends paid of $42.6 million, $20.9 million used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, and $13.3 million for employee taxes paid from withholding of restricted stock units. Purchases of equity-method investments of $7.4 million also offset the cash inflows.\nCash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $314.8 million, reflecting $296.3 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $18.5 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities, which included bonus payments of $48.2 million.\nIn December 2018, we amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to December 21, 2020 with no other changes in terms. The agreement provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million. We had an outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million as of December 31, 2018, leaving borrowing availability of $230.0 million. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments. We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments. We invest a portion of our investment balance (approximately $24.1 million, or 91% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2018) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.\nApproximately 67% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2018 was held by our operations outside the U.S., down from about 69% as of December 31, 2017. The amount of accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $209.2 million as of December 31, 2018. In February 2019, we repatriated approximately $45.8 million of these foreign earnings back to the U.S. Otherwise, we generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. We have not recorded deferred income taxes on the $209.2 million primarily because most of these earnings were previously subject to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax under that Tax Reform Act, which we recorded in 2017 as an expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nWe intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.\nIn December 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018. The authorization expires on December 31, 2020. In 2018, we repurchased a total of approximately 0.2 million shares for $20.9 million and had approximately $479.1 million available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we also paid dividends of $42.6 million. In February 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2019 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2019. While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 28 cents per share in 2019.\nWe expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2019, primarily for computer hardware and software provided by third parties, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations. We continue to adopt more public cloud and software as a service applications for new initiatives and are in the process of migrating relevant parts of our data center to the public cloud over the next several years. During this migration, we expect to run certain applications and infrastructure in parallel. These actions will have some transitional effects on our level of capital expenditures and operating expenses.\nWe also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2019 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $62.0 million related to the 2018 bonus compared to $48.2 million in 2017.\nConsolidated Free Cash Flow\nAs described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business. Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP. Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generated free cash flow of $238.7 million in 2018, an increase of $55.2 million versus 2017. The change reflects a $64.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $9.5 million increase in capital expenditures.\nWe generated free cash flow of $183.5 million in 2017, an increase of $32.6 million versus 2016. The change reflects a $36.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $3.8 million increase in capital expenditures.\nAcquisitions\nWe paid a total of $193.0 million, less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years. We describe these acquisitions in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe paid a total of $48.7 million related to purchasing additional investments in unconsolidated entities over the past three years. We describe these investments in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDivestitures\nWe sold our 15(c) board consulting services product line in 2018 and received a total of $10.5 million related to this sale. We sold HelloWallet in 2017 and received a total of $23.7 million related to this sale. For more information, please see Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions. If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nMost of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services. We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years. We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services. We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.\nWe make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including identifying the transaction price in a contract. It is probable that we will collect all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately. We recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers. If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.\nWe make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection of the consideration to which we are entitled is probable. We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.\nDeferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and at the end of 2018, it totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\nThe amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions. The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations. To the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.\nAcquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\nOur financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.\nAllocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment. We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.\nDetermining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired. These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and noncompete agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets. These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset. For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates. For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life. For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on our assessment of impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.\nWe believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories. Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, performance share awards, and market stock units.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period. We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant. We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.\nWe adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.\nBecause of timing differences required by tax law, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent. Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $37.9 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $58.1 million. The deferred tax assets include $2.4 million of deferred tax assets related to $10.6 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $2.0 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized. We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $1.0 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance. If we determine a lower allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance. These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed. This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.\nWe use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns. We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nWe use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities. It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority. We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.\nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations. These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions. Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment. If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases: On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019. The new standard originally required the use of a modified retrospective approach upon adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements, which allows an additional transition method to adopt the new lease standard at the adoption date instead of the beginning of the earliest period presented and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this transition method at the adoption date of January 1, 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We are making meaningful progress on our implementation plan and achieving project milestones, including a comprehensive review of our lease portfolio to identify all leases where the company is either a lessor or lessee. In addition, we implemented lease accounting software in early 2019 to assist in our ongoing lease data collection, tracking and analysis, and are updating our lease processes and related internal controls to reflect changes required to ensure readiness for adoption. We are updating our accounting policies and plan to make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet. We also plan to recognize those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our liquidity. The adoption of the new lease standard will have no impact on our debt-covenant compliance under our current agreements.\nIncome Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income: On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act's reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nCompensation-Stock Compensation: On June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Under the new standard, the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing), with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition, the contractual term can be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nCloud Computing: On August 29, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and when an arrangement is solely a hosted CCA service. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The new guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued. Entities can choose to adopt the new guidance prospectively to eligible costs incurred on or after the date this guidance is first applied or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum commitments on non-cancelable operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum payments related to long-term financing agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum payments on credit facility (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for office space.\n(2) The minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.\n(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits).

We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant. We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016 (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>911.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NMF\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: adoption of accounting changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplemental Operating Metrics (Unaudited)\n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.

For example, jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, and Singapore have adopted or are considering the adoption of more stringent rules that will require that specific individuals be identified as responsible for certain senior management functions and will hold a firm's senior management team personally accountable for their own and their firm's actions and conduct. Data privacy regulation continues to proliferate, as various jurisdictions such as the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Brazil, and the State of California join the European Union in adopting comprehensive data privacy regulation. Since operations in the financial services industry require the processing of significant amounts of personally identifiable information (PII), we believe the burdens of regulation, and possibly inconsistent regulation, will proliferate. As a related matter, issues of cybersecurity as they relate to the identification and mitigation of system vulnerabilities should also grow in prominence as services rendered by the industry become increasingly digital over time. For example, the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations has indicated that its 2019 examination programs will prioritize cybersecurity with an emphasis on, among other things, proper configuration of network storage devices, information security governance, and policies and procedures related to retail trading information security.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nDepreciation expense rose $16.3 million in 2017 from higher depreciation expense related to capitalized software development and computer equipment incurred over the past several years.

Under the new standard, the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing), with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services.

opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.\nSales and marketing\nLeases: On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019. The new standard originally required the use of a modified retrospective approach upon adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements, which allows an additional transition method to adopt the new lease standard at the adoption date instead of the beginning of the earliest period presented and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this transition method at the adoption date of January 1, 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We are making meaningful progress on our implementation plan and achieving project milestones, including a comprehensive review of our lease portfolio to identify all leases where the company is either a lessor or lessee. In addition, we implemented lease accounting software in early 2019 to assist in our ongoing lease data collection, tracking and analysis, and are updating our lease processes and related internal controls to reflect changes required to ensure readiness for adoption. We are updating our accounting policies and plan to make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet. We also plan to recognize those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods. For subscription-based products, we calculate a retention rate based on the number of subscriptions retained during the year as a percentage of the number of subscriptions up for renewal. For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period. We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify. We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the actual revenue for the previous comparable fiscal period as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage. The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2019.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,019.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>911.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties; \nRevenue Recognition\nFor these contract-based products and services, we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 100% in 2018, compared with 102% in 2017. The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes; increasing client bases upon contract renewal; changes to the contract value upon renewal (such as increased users); and changes in the value of variable-fee contracts. These factors, therefore, can lead to a renewal rate percentage over 100%.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 vs. 2016 (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: adoption of accounting changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International organic revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n(16) Transaction-based revenue includes Morningstar Credit Ratings, Internet advertising sales, and Conferences.\nProduction expense increased $9.7 million in 2018, related primarily to our adoption of Topic 606.

Compensation expense increased $8.2 million due to higher headcount at PitchBook. Stock-based compensation increased $6.3 million, primarily for management bonus plan expense related to PitchBook during 2017. Rent expense and software subscriptions also contributed to the increase in 2017.\n\nWe expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost. We estimate that this expense will total approximately $19.2 million in 2019. Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and foreign currency translation.\nWe intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.\nDeferred Revenue\nGeneral and administrative\nConsolidated Free Cash Flow\nIn 2017, our operating expense increased $124.1 million, or 20.1%. Foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $0.6 million in 2017.\nWe continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions. If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nIn December 2018, we amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to December 21, 2020 with no other changes in terms. The agreement provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million. We had an outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million as of December 31, 2018, leaving borrowing availability of $230.0 million. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations. These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions. Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment. If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.\nCost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 6.3%, in 2018. Higher compensation expense of $15.8 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $9.8 million. Higher production expense also contributed to the unfavorable variance in this category and includes $6.7 million of expense related to our adoption of Topic 606. See Note 18 for additional information.\nIn 2017, we had $57.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook. Revenue in 2016 included $4.4 million of revenue from HelloWallet, which we divested in the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the second half of 2017. Revenue from PitchBook was treated as acquired revenue through November 2017 and was incorporated into organic growth statistics after December 1, 2017. Because HelloWallet was divested in the second quarter of 2017, we excluded HelloWallet's last six months of 2016 revenue from our organic revenue growth calculation. In addition, foreign currency translations had no net material impact on revenue in 2017. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 7.6% in 2017.\npp - percentage points\nWe make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including identifying the transaction price in a contract. It is probable that we will collect all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately. We recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers. If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.\nSales and marketing expense increased $14.2 million, or 10.6%, in 2018, reflecting a $11.8 million increase in compensation expense. Offsetting this increase was a decrease of $2.9 million in commission expense that is now being capitalized as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Advertising and marketing spend also decreased $1.1 million during 2018 due to a shift in strategy and mix of spend related to greater use of digital channels versus direct mail campaigns.\nOrganic revenue\nEffective Tax Rate and Income Tax Expense\nWe are also subject to additional provisions of the Tax Reform Act effective from January 1, 2018.\n(6) Excludes $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion of assets under advisement and management related to Manager Selection Services as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that were reclassified to Morningstar Data.

Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.\nWe paid a total of $48.7 million related to purchasing additional investments in unconsolidated entities over the past three years. We describe these investments in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTransaction-based revenue grew 9.8% during 2018, driven by Morningstar Credit Ratings and ad sales on Morningstar.com. Morningstar Credit Ratings completed 138 new-issue ratings, primarily of structured finance securities, representing a 49.2% increase in the asset value of the issues rated during 2018 compared to 2017.\nWe define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations. We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business. We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture. For adoption of accounting changes, we exclude the effects of the adoption for the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018, as prior period results have not been adjusted. Organic revenue is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nInternational Operations\nTo allow for more meaningful comparisons of our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations. In 2018, we divested our 15(c) board consulting services product line and did not make any significant acquisitions. We also adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, which had a favorable impact on revenue. In 2017, we divested HelloWallet and did not make any acquisitions.\nInternational organic revenue increased 9.2% during 2018. Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Managed Portfolios were the main contributors to the organic international growth. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted international revenue by $6.4 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios in Australia. See Note 18 for additional information.\nOur financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.\n(7) Revised to exclude temporary employees and part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week.\n \u2022 the failure to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees; \nWe experienced strong revenue growth across all revenue types during 2018.\nCash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $314.8 million, reflecting $296.3 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $18.5 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities, which included bonus payments of $48.2 million.\nVolatility characterized global equity markets in 2018, as the prospect of trade wars shook global economic expectations, a decade's worth of low-interest rates began reversing, and political uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe further impacted the outlook. The Morningstar U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, hit a record high on September 20, 2018, then fell 14.6% by year-end. This index finished 2018 with a full-year loss of 5.1%, ending a run that lasted the better part of a decade. International equities fared even worse, as Morningstar's Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished 2018 down 13.7%, with the Developed Markets ex-U.S. Index down 13.9% and the Emerging Markets Index down 13.2%.\nLicense-based revenue grew 12.6% during 2018. We experienced continued demand for license-based products, such as PitchBook Data, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct. Revenue from PitchBook Data increased by $36.0 million due primarily to strong sales of new licenses and high renewal rates. The number of PitchBook Platform licenses increased to 22,979 at the end of 2018, compared with 13,908 at the end of 2017 and 9,723 at the end of 2016. Morningstar Data revenue increased by $19.1 million in 2018, as result of adding new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients by adding additional datasets primarily within our managed products and market data product lines.\nWith respect to indexes, European Union Benchmarks Regulation 2016/1011 came into force on June 30, 2016 with a majority of its provisions having a compliance date of January 1, 2018. The principal objective of the Regulation is to ensure benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (e.g., a tracking index of a ETF) are free of conflicts of interest, are used appropriately and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure. This Regulation applies to Morningstar's index group as a result of making available its indexes to European investable product sponsors (e.g., ETF sponsors) as the tracking index for their investable product.\nWe generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services. We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook Data, through license agreements. Our license agreements typically range from one to three years. We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions. These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.\nCloud Computing: On August 29, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and when an arrangement is solely a hosted CCA service. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The new guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued. Entities can choose to adopt the new guidance prospectively to eligible costs incurred on or after the date this guidance is first applied or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.\nWe believe these regulatory tends will continue in financial markets worldwide.\nIn 2018, operating expense increased $62.2 million, or 8.4%. Foreign currency translations increased our operating expense by $2.6 million in 2018.\nIncome Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income: On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act's reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRevenue from international operations increased $31.0 million, or 13.8%, in 2018 and $16.6 million, or 8.0% in 2017.\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2018 and 0.7 percentage points in 2017.\n \u2022 failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation; \nDepreciation expense rose $8.4 million in 2018, mainly driven by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development incurred over the past several years. Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.9 million in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.\n\n \u2022 liability relating to the acquisition or redistribution of data or information we acquire or errors included therein; and \n(14) License-based revenue includes Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Enterprise Components, Morningstar Research, PitchBook Data, and other similar products. License-based revenue during 2018 included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement.\nMost of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services. We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years. We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services. We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.\nOperating Expense\n(3) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals. The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase,\u201d decrease,\u201d grew,\u201d declined,\u201d was up,\u201d was down,\u201d was flat,\u201d or was similar\u201d refer to a comparison with the prior year unless otherwise stated.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $11.0 million in 2017 as revenue increased $113.1 million and operating expense increased $124.1 million. Operating margin was 18.6%, a decrease of 4.0 percentage points compared with 2016.\nAlthough actively-managed vehicles in aggregate experienced over $303.0 billion of outflows in 2018, most of the decline came from actively-managed U.S. equity mutual funds. Actively-managed ETFs attracted almost $27 billion of investor flows through 2018.\nThe amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions. The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations. To the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, changing to a territorial tax system and imposing a transitional tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective from January 1, 2018.\n(9) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Data revenue during 2018 by $1.5 million.\n(5) The 2017 decline was due to client losses related to a strategic shift away from our customized investment management offerings to Managed Portfolios. Also, 2017 and 2016 numbers were revised to exclude Australia and South Africa assets, which are reflected in Morningstar Managed Portfolios.\nConsolidated Revenue\nRevenue by region\nThe U.S. venture capital market also set a record in 2018 for the most capital ever invested in a single year. Driven by record amounts of capital invested in financing rounds of at least $100 million, roughly $131 billion in capital was invested. Over $55 billion in capital was raised by new vehicles, representing a 62.7% year-over-year increase and setting a record for the most capital raised in a single year. European markets also experienced a surge in total capital deployed by venture capital investors. Driven by an increase in the median deal size across all investment stages, over \u20ac20.5 billion was raised by European-headquartered startups in 2018, the largest figure in at least a decade.\n(13) Excluding the negative 6.5 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 9.7% for the full year in 2017. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018.\nThe European Commission announced its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance in May 2018. The proposed amendments would adjust the Benchmarks Regulation to create a new category of low-carbon and positive carbon benchmarks as well as change MiFID II to include ESG preferences in the advice they offer to investors. The Plan also proposed new regulations on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and risks and on the establishment of a unified classification system on what can be considered an environmentally sustainable economic activity.\nWe describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operating Income and Operating Margin\n \u2022 an outage of our database, technology-based products and services, or network facilities or the movement of parts of our technology infrastructure to the public cloud; \n\nIn response to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the complexity in accounting which allowed SEC registrants to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the Tax Reform Act within the one-year measurement period required by SAB 118.\nWe make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection of the consideration to which we are entitled is probable. We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.\nIn December 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018. The authorization expires on December 31, 2020. In 2018, we repurchased a total of approximately 0.2 million shares for $20.9 million and had approximately $479.1 million available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2018.\n\nAcquisitions\nIn the European Union, the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), became effective in January 2018. The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance. If we determine a lower allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance. These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed. This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.\nNon-operating income in 2016 includes the $37.1 million gain we recorded with the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.\nOur investment management products have multiple fee structures, which vary by client and region. In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios. For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two. Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees. In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter. Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.\n \u2022 the failure of acquisitions and other investments to produce the results we anticipate; \nWe had 4,920 employees worldwide at the end of 2017, compared with 4,550 in 2016. This increase reflected continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including data operations in India and China and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nNMF - Not meaningful\nContractual Obligations\n\u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Our capital expenditures are mainly for capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements. We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter. We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years. We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.\nOrganic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.\nConsolidated operating income increased $46.0 million in 2018 as revenue increased $108.2 million and operating expense increased $62.2 million. Operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2017.\nAside from Morningstar Managed Portfolios, it's difficult for our Investment Management business to quantify these cash inflows and outflows. The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period. We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.\n\u2022 Revenue (including organic revenue);\nEquity in net loss of unconsolidated entities primarily reflects income from Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) offset by losses in our other equity method investments.\nIn the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally. Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.\nFor 2018, the $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement positively impacted operating income growth by 6.2 percentage points and operating margin by 0.8 percentage points. This recognition of revenue was not accompanied by a commensurate increase in operating expense.\nSales and marketing expense increased $36.7 million in 2017. Compensation expense increased $21.2 million due primarily to higher headcount at PitchBook. Sales commission expense also increased $12.6 million during 2017.\nEquity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Entities\nWe continually monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry. We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\n(2) The asset totals shown above (including assets we either manage directly or for which we provide consulting or subadvisory work) only include assets for which we receive basis-point fees. Some of our client contracts include services for which we receive a flat fee, but we do not include those assets in the total reported.\nIn 2018 and 2017, our consolidated revenue rose 11.9% and 14.2%, respectively. Foreign currency movements increased revenue by $4.0 million in 2018 and had no net material impact on revenue in 2017.\nCompensation expense increased $65.5 million in 2017 with bonus expense increasing $18.7 million. Bonus expense was higher due to stronger performance against our internal targets. Depreciation expense in 2017 included a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy.\nWe expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2019, primarily for computer hardware and software provided by third parties, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations. We continue to adopt more public cloud and software as a service applications for new initiatives and are in the process of migrating relevant parts of our data center to the public cloud over the next several years. During this migration, we expect to run certain applications and infrastructure in parallel. These actions will have some transitional effects on our level of capital expenditures and operating expenses.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n \u2022 volatility in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy and its effect on our revenue from asset-based fees and credit ratings business; \nIn addition to industry developments in 2018, there are several longer-term regulatory trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.\nOverall, depreciation and amortization increased $5.5 million, or 6.0%, in 2018 and $20.5 million, or 28.9%, in 2017.\nThe Year 2018 in Review\nIn Australia, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has been investigating banking and wealth management businesses. In a final report issued on February 1, 2019, the commission did not recommend the elimination of vertically integrated wealth management business models but has proposed a tighter set of rules around such vertical integration to make it more difficult to inappropriately incentivize the sale of financial products through aligned distribution channels. In particular financial advisers will be required to disclose to a client why they are not independent, impartial and unbiased before providing advice. The commission has also recommended a stronger regulatory presence with the imposition of more fines and an increase in enforcement litigation. The fund management industry also continues to be an area of regulatory reform with the introduction of the Asia Region Funds Passport and Corporate Collective Investment Vehicle Schemes, the review of fees and costs disclosure for managed investment and superannuation funds, and a suite of seven new and updated regulatory guides for the fund management industry.\nRising interest rates, especially at the long end of the yield curve, along with widening corporate bond credit spreads hampered fixed-income returns in 2018. Over the course of the year, the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds rose 27 basis points. The total annual return for Morningstar's Core Bond Index (our broadest measure of the fixed-income universe) was essentially unchanged for the year. Breaking the overall index down, Morningstar's Short-Term Core Bond Index rose approximately 1.5% and the Intermediate Core Bond Index rose 0.9%, but these gains were offset by the Long-Term Core Bond Index, which fell 3.2%.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $37.9 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $58.1 million. The deferred tax assets include $2.4 million of deferred tax assets related to $10.6 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $2.0 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized. We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $1.0 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.\nRevenue\n \u2022 Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset. For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates. For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life. For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.  We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on our assessment of impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and \"whole of market\" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013. The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors. The U.K. regulator is monitoring the implementation of RDR and is scheduled to publish a review of its findings in 2019. In addition to the RDR, the U.K. regulator and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) launched the Financial Advice Market Review (FAMR) in 2015 in light of concerns that the market for financial advice was not working well for consumers. FAMR aimed to explore ways in which the government, industry, and regulators could take collective steps to stimulate the development of a market, which delivers affordable and accessible financial advice and guidance to everyone. FAMR's final report, published in March 2016, set out 28 recommendations intended to tackle barriers to consumers accessing advice. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HMT will review the outcomes of FAMR in 2019.\nBecause of timing differences required by tax law, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent. Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nWe generated free cash flow of $183.5 million in 2017, an increase of $32.6 million versus 2016. The change reflects a $36.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $3.8 million increase in capital expenditures.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content. While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low. This reflects our business focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management. At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results. During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate. When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nBased on PitchBook Platform data, on an aggregated basis, U.S. private capital markets experienced record performance in 2018, as evidenced by many different metrics. Over $713 billion worth of private equity-backed transactions were recorded across an estimated 4,828 completed deals, setting a record for the number of completed deals in a year. The total deal-value figure represented the second-highest yearly figure PitchBook has ever reported. In addition, despite significant volatility in various asset classes, valuations across private equity and M&A remained stable.\nDuring 2018, licensed-based revenue also included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement recorded in the third quarter.\nWe also generate transaction-based revenue, including the sale of advertising on our websites and sponsorship of conferences. In our credit ratings business, we primarily generate revenue through our provision of ratings on new issues of securities.\n\n(12) Morningstar did not acquire full ownership of PitchBook until December 2016; therefore 2016 results reflected one month of operations.\n \u2022 Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired. These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and noncompete agreements. \n\u2022 Cost of revenue. This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers. For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports. It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products. In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects. This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category. Cost of revenue also includes other expenses such as third-party data purchases and data lines.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-Operating Income\nRevenue from Morningstar Direct rose $13.5 million in 2018, reflecting growth in licenses for both new and existing clients and certain price increases. The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 15,033 worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 13,884 at the end of 2017 and 12,492 at the end of 2016, with growth in both the U.S. and internationally.\n\nNon-Operating Income, Equity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Entities, and Effective Tax Rate and Income Tax Expense\nForeign currency translation had a favorable effect of $4.0 million on revenue in 2018. Our 2017 results included revenue of $6.1 million from our divestitures of HelloWallet and our 15(c) board consulting services product line, which did not recur in 2018. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted revenue by $6.7 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios. See Note 18 for additional information. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 11.4% in 2018.\nThe graph below illustrates our retention metrics over the past five years for contract-based products and services, primarily Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, PitchBook, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office.\nAllocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment. We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.\nKey Business Characteristics\nSome of the main contributors to the 2017 revenue increase were PitchBook Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Credit Ratings.\nInterest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio. Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility. Gain on sale of business relates to our sale of HelloWallet in June 2017. Gain on sale of product line relates to the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018. Gain on sale of equity investments relates to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership interest in Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) in the third quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated Operating Expense\nCost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services. We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.\nIn 2018, we also paid dividends of $42.6 million. In February 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2019 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2019. While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 28 cents per share in 2019.\nContingencies\nBased on Morningstar Asset Flows data, U.S. fund assets, composed of both long-term open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaled about $17.0 trillion as of December 31, 2018, compared with over $18.1 trillion as of December 31, 2017. Ending the year at approximately $3.4 trillion in assets under management, the U.S. ETF industry remained largely flat year-over-year, as market declines slightly offset investor inflows. In contrast, assets under management in U.S. long-term open-end funds declined to $13.6 trillion from $14.7 trillion in the prior year due to both market declines and investor outflows. In 2018, investors continued to favor passively-managed vehicles, with net inflows of more than $457.0 billion for passively managed funds and ETFs.\n\u2022 Free cash flow.\nDivestitures\nApproximately 67% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2018 was held by our operations outside the U.S., down from about 69% as of December 31, 2017. The amount of accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $209.2 million as of December 31, 2018. In February 2019, we repatriated approximately $45.8 million of these foreign earnings back to the U.S. Otherwise, we generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. We have not recorded deferred income taxes on the $209.2 million primarily because most of these earnings were previously subject to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax under that Tax Reform Act, which we recorded in 2017 as an expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.\n \u2022 trends in the asset management industry, including the decreasing popularity of actively managed investment vehicles and increased industry consolidation; \nThe tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue:\n\nWe include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories. Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, performance share awards, and market stock units.\nIn the United Kingdom, the FCA will also publish the final report of its Platforms Market Study in 2019. The Study explores the value offered, competition and whether the relationships between platforms, advisers, asset managers and fund ratings providers work in the interests of investors. Also, as of September 2019, U.K. fund managers must appoint a minimum of two independent directors to their boards and conduct an annual assessment of the value that they deliver to investors. These new rules are borne from the regulators Asset Management Market Study that sought to ensure fund managers compete on the value they deliver and act in the interests of investors.\n\u2022 General and administrative. This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments. It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.\nCompensation expense (which primarily consists of salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $33.4 million in 2018. Salary expense increased by $17.4 million, primarily driven by higher headcount at PitchBook. We accrued higher bonus expense of $16.5 million in 2018 due to stronger performance against our internal targets.\nWe use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities. It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority. We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.\n \u2022 inadequacy of our business continuity program in the event of a material emergency or adverse political or regulatory developments; \n\u2022 Sales and marketing. This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and marketing professionals. We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.\nAs a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was flat in 2018 and increased 2.5 percentage points in 2017.\n \u2022 failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy; \ninclude, among others:\nSignificant Operating Leverage\nWe generated free cash flow of $238.7 million in 2018, an increase of $55.2 million versus 2017. The change reflects a $64.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $9.5 million increase in capital expenditures.\nOur goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders. We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts, but may not build long-term shareholder value.\nWe paid a total of $193.0 million, less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years. We describe these acquisitions in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the U.S., the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) new fiduciary standard that would have expanded the definition of a fiduciary for certain financial advisors who provide advice related to retirement planning was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in March 2018. The new rule was previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017. In April 2018, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest\u201d and may finalize this rule in 2019. Regulation Best Interest echoes many of the principals of the DOL's rule, although it does not contain the same types of bright-line prohibitions on certain kinds of compensation, nor expose advisors to class-action lawsuits.\nDetermining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations, including the concentration of data and development work at our offshore facilities in China and India; \n(2) The minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $395.9 million, up $42.6 million from the end of 2017. The increase reflects cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds of $15.5 million related to the sale and purchase of investments, and proceeds of $10.5 million related to the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018. The sale of a portion of an equity-method investment also generated proceeds of $7.9 million. These items were partially offset by $110.0 million of repayments of long-term debt, $76.1 million of capital expenditures, dividends paid of $42.6 million, $20.9 million used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, and $13.3 million for employee taxes paid from withholding of restricted stock units. Purchases of equity-method investments of $7.4 million also offset the cash inflows.\nCost of revenue\nExcluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.\nIn 2017, international organic revenue increased 8.0%.\nWe invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers. We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities) at the end of 2018. For 2017, the amount of deferred revenue was $185.5 million (of which $171.3 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\nA more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\n(11) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Investment Management revenue during 2018 by $5.0 million.\n(15) Asset-based revenue includes Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Indexes.\n(4) 2017 and 2016 amounts are revised to include assets from Australia, which were previously reflected in Institutional Asset Management. 2016 was also revised to include assets from South Africa.\n(10) Restated from prior periods due to realignment of individual products within the product groups.\nThe tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue:\nThe table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:\nRefer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and the amounts that we recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, and for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate.\n \u2022 the failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of intellectual property infringement against us. \nPartially offsetting these increases was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. We accelerated development of our major software platforms, resulting in an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense. During 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million, associated with software development activities, mainly related to PitchBook, Morningstar Data, Workplace Solutions, and additional enhancements to reporting, financial planning, and other capabilities in our products. In comparison, we capitalized $28.2 million in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization\n(8) Key product and investment area revenue and revenue by type includes the effect of foreign currency translations.\nOrganic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nAsset-based revenue increased 10.0% during 2018, primarily driven by Morningstar Managed Portfolios and Workplace Solutions. The adoption of Topic 606 favorably impacted asset-based revenue growth by 2.7 percentage points during 2018. See Note 18 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 18) for additional information. Morningstar Investment Management revenue increased $10.2 million during 2018 due to growth in Morningstar Managed Portfolios offset by declines in institutional asset management. Workplace Solutions revenue increased 2.4% during 2018. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture in 2017, Workplace Solutions revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018. The asset-based revenue we earn in both Morningstar Investment Management and Workplace Solutions is generally based on average asset levels during each quarter. Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $200.1 billion in 2018, compared with $206.2 billion in 2017 and $192.0 billion in 2016.\n\nWe adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.\n \u2022 compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations; \nIn our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures. We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements. Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.\nHigher compensation expense, depreciation expense, professional fees, and sales commission expense were the main drivers that contributed to the increase in operating expense in 2017.\nWe offer an extensive line of products and services for individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors and other participants in the private capital markets. Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements. As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.\n \u2022 liability related to the storage of personal information related to individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information; \nAcquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\nRenewal Rates\nCost of revenue increased $42.3 million in 2017. Higher compensation expense of $36.1 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $12.0 million. Professional fees and production expense also contributed to the increase in this category.\nHigher internally developed capitalized software partially offset these increases. Continuous focus on development of our major software platforms, coupled with bringing new products and capabilities to market, resulted in an increase in capitalized software development, which in turn reduced operating expense. During 2018, we capitalized $53.5 million associated with software development activities, mainly related to enhanced capabilities in our products, internal infrastructure, and software, including PitchBook, Morningstar Cloud Platform, and Morningstar Enterprise Components. In comparison, we capitalized $46.3 million in 2017.\nDeferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and at the end of 2018, it totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\n \u2022 failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools; \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $18.0 million, or 13.9%, during 2018. Compensation expense increased $5.8 million during 2018 with bonus expense increasing $2.9 million. Stock-based compensation increased $5.1 million due to accelerated vesting related to retirement or service provisions and more equity awards granted. Rent expense increased $2.1 million and software subscriptions increased $2.1 million during 2018.\n\nWe believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments. We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments. We invest a portion of our investment balance (approximately $24.1 million, or 91% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2018) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d seek,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d or continue.\u201d These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect. For us, these risks and uncertainties\nWe had 5,416 employees worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 4,920 in 2017. This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including operations in India and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nWe use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns. We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nPartially offsetting our 2017 total operating expense increase was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. In 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million of software development expense compared to $28.2 million of software development expense in 2016.\n\u2022 Operating income (loss); and\nGeneral and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was flat in 2018 and 1.0 percentage point in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate in 2018 was 20.7%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 23.9% in 2017, primarily due to the 2018 tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act and also because of updates to our provisional tax estimates recorded in 2017.\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business. Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity. Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOffsetting these expenses in 2018 was an increase in capitalized software development of $7.2 million. Lower intangible amortization of $2.9 million also offset the increase in expenses in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized. Commission expense also decreased $2.9 million as a result of the adoption of Topic 606.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements. We account for certain minority-owned investments in international locations, including Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) and Sustainalytics Holding B.V. (Sustainalytics), using the equity method.", "item_7_text": "Other income (expense), net primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from resulting from U.S. dollar denominated short-term investments held in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period. We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant. We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.\nSupplemental Operating Metrics (Unaudited)\n \u2022 Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets. These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce. \nAs described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business. Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP. Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nInternational organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOur effective tax rate in 2017 was 23.9%, a decrease of 4.4 percentage points compared with 28.3% in 2016, primarily because of the provisional tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act.\nRegulators in the financial services industry have indicated they are increasingly concerned by risk factors related to senior management accountability, data protection and privacy, and cybersecurity. For example, jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, and Singapore have adopted or are considering the adoption of more stringent rules that will require that specific individuals be identified as responsible for certain senior management functions and will hold a firm's senior management team personally accountable for their own and their firm's actions and conduct. Data privacy regulation continues to proliferate, as various jurisdictions such as the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Brazil, and the State of California join the European Union in adopting comprehensive data privacy regulation. Since operations in the financial services industry require the processing of significant amounts of personally identifiable information (PII), we believe the burdens of regulation, and possibly inconsistent regulation, will proliferate. As a related matter, issues of cybersecurity as they relate to the identification and mitigation of system vulnerabilities should also grow in prominence as services rendered by the industry become increasingly digital over time. For example, the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations has indicated that its 2019 examination programs will prioritize cybersecurity with an emphasis on, among other things, proper configuration of network storage devices, information security governance, and policies and procedures related to retail trading information security.\n\nDepreciation expense rose $16.3 million in 2017 from higher depreciation expense related to capitalized software development and computer equipment incurred over the past several years. Depreciation expense during 2017 also included a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy. Intangible amortization expense increased $4.2 million in 2017 due to additional amortization expense for the intangible assets of PitchBook offset by certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions that are now fully amortized.\nCompensation-Stock Compensation: On June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Under the new standard, the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing), with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition, the contractual term can be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n(1) In prior periods, the Company estimated traffic on Morningstar.com using a combination of internal tools and a third-party platform. The new website launched in the first quarter of 2018 now allows tracking of 100% of website traffic using a third-party platform. The Company believes the current reporting is a more accurate representation of traffic, and this change in methodology is the primary driver of the difference in reported traffic numbers versus 2017.\nAs discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.\nWe sold our 15(c) board consulting services product line in 2018 and received a total of $10.5 million related to this sale. We sold HelloWallet in 2017 and received a total of $23.7 million related to this sale. For more information, please see Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Results\n(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits). The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2019. The table excludes $7.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.\nUnderstanding Our Company\nOur effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.\nSales and marketing\nLeases: On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019. The new standard originally required the use of a modified retrospective approach upon adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements, which allows an additional transition method to adopt the new lease standard at the adoption date instead of the beginning of the earliest period presented and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this transition method at the adoption date of January 1, 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We are making meaningful progress on our implementation plan and achieving project milestones, including a comprehensive review of our lease portfolio to identify all leases where the company is either a lessor or lessee. In addition, we implemented lease accounting software in early 2019 to assist in our ongoing lease data collection, tracking and analysis, and are updating our lease processes and related internal controls to reflect changes required to ensure readiness for adoption. We are updating our accounting policies and plan to make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet. We also plan to recognize those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our liquidity. The adoption of the new lease standard will have no impact on our debt-covenant compliance under our current agreements.\nWe exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period.\nInternational revenue comprised approximately 25% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, compared with 26% in 2016. About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom. We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.\nWe provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:\n\nTo evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods. For subscription-based products, we calculate a retention rate based on the number of subscriptions retained during the year as a percentage of the number of subscriptions up for renewal. For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period. We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify. We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the actual revenue for the previous comparable fiscal period as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage. The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2019.\n \u2022 liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties; \nRevenue Recognition\nFor these contract-based products and services, we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 100% in 2018, compared with 102% in 2017. The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes; increasing client bases upon contract renewal; changes to the contract value upon renewal (such as increased users); and changes in the value of variable-fee contracts. These factors, therefore, can lead to a renewal rate percentage over 100%.\n\n(16) Transaction-based revenue includes Morningstar Credit Ratings, Internet advertising sales, and Conferences.\nProduction expense increased $9.7 million in 2018, related primarily to our adoption of Topic 606. See Note 18 for additional information. Depreciation expense increased $8.4 million in 2018, driven mainly by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development incurred over the past several years. Stock-based compensation expense increased $7.7 million in 2018 due to stronger performance against our incentive plan targets as well as accelerated vesting related to retirement or service provisions.\nWe classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below. We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table presents the components of non-operating income, net:\nWe also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2019 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $62.0 million related to the 2018 bonus compared to $48.2 million in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $24.6 million, or 23.3%, during 2017. Compensation expense increased $8.2 million due to higher headcount at PitchBook. Stock-based compensation increased $6.3 million, primarily for management bonus plan expense related to PitchBook during 2017. Rent expense and software subscriptions also contributed to the increase in 2017.\n\nWe expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost. We estimate that this expense will total approximately $19.2 million in 2019. Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and foreign currency translation.\nWe intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.\nDeferred Revenue\nGeneral and administrative\nConsolidated Free Cash Flow\nIn 2017, our operating expense increased $124.1 million, or 20.1%. Foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $0.6 million in 2017.\nWe continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions. If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nIn December 2018, we amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to December 21, 2020 with no other changes in terms. The agreement provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million. We had an outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million as of December 31, 2018, leaving borrowing availability of $230.0 million. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations. These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions. Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment. If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.\nCost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 6.3%, in 2018. Higher compensation expense of $15.8 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $9.8 million. Higher production expense also contributed to the unfavorable variance in this category and includes $6.7 million of expense related to our adoption of Topic 606. See Note 18 for additional information.\nIn 2017, we had $57.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook. Revenue in 2016 included $4.4 million of revenue from HelloWallet, which we divested in the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the second half of 2017. Revenue from PitchBook was treated as acquired revenue through November 2017 and was incorporated into organic growth statistics after December 1, 2017. Because HelloWallet was divested in the second quarter of 2017, we excluded HelloWallet's last six months of 2016 revenue from our organic revenue growth calculation. In addition, foreign currency translations had no net material impact on revenue in 2017. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 7.6% in 2017.\npp - percentage points\nWe make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including identifying the transaction price in a contract. It is probable that we will collect all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately. We recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers. If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.\nSales and marketing expense increased $14.2 million, or 10.6%, in 2018, reflecting a $11.8 million increase in compensation expense. Offsetting this increase was a decrease of $2.9 million in commission expense that is now being capitalized as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Advertising and marketing spend also decreased $1.1 million during 2018 due to a shift in strategy and mix of spend related to greater use of digital channels versus direct mail campaigns.\nOrganic revenue\nEffective Tax Rate and Income Tax Expense\nWe are also subject to additional provisions of the Tax Reform Act effective from January 1, 2018.\n(6) Excludes $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion of assets under advisement and management related to Manager Selection Services as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that were reclassified to Morningstar Data. The associated revenue is included in Morningstar Data.\n(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for office space.\nWhen our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars. Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.\nWe paid a total of $48.7 million related to purchasing additional investments in unconsolidated entities over the past three years. We describe these investments in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTransaction-based revenue grew 9.8% during 2018, driven by Morningstar Credit Ratings and ad sales on Morningstar.com. Morningstar Credit Ratings completed 138 new-issue ratings, primarily of structured finance securities, representing a 49.2% increase in the asset value of the issues rated during 2018 compared to 2017.\nWe define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations. We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business. We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture. For adoption of accounting changes, we exclude the effects of the adoption for the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018, as prior period results have not been adjusted. Organic revenue is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nInternational Operations\nTo allow for more meaningful comparisons of our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations. In 2018, we divested our 15(c) board consulting services product line and did not make any significant acquisitions. We also adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, which had a favorable impact on revenue. In 2017, we divested HelloWallet and did not make any acquisitions.\nInternational organic revenue increased 9.2% during 2018. Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Managed Portfolios were the main contributors to the organic international growth. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted international revenue by $6.4 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios in Australia. See Note 18 for additional information.\nOur financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.\n(7) Revised to exclude temporary employees and part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week.\n \u2022 the failure to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees; \nWe experienced strong revenue growth across all revenue types during 2018.\nCash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash. In 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $314.8 million, reflecting $296.3 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $18.5 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities, which included bonus payments of $48.2 million.\nVolatility characterized global equity markets in 2018, as the prospect of trade wars shook global economic expectations, a decade's worth of low-interest rates began reversing, and political uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe further impacted the outlook. The Morningstar U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, hit a record high on September 20, 2018, then fell 14.6% by year-end. This index finished 2018 with a full-year loss of 5.1%, ending a run that lasted the better part of a decade. International equities fared even worse, as Morningstar's Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished 2018 down 13.7%, with the Developed Markets ex-U.S. Index down 13.9% and the Emerging Markets Index down 13.2%.\nLicense-based revenue grew 12.6% during 2018. We experienced continued demand for license-based products, such as PitchBook Data, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct. Revenue from PitchBook Data increased by $36.0 million due primarily to strong sales of new licenses and high renewal rates. The number of PitchBook Platform licenses increased to 22,979 at the end of 2018, compared with 13,908 at the end of 2017 and 9,723 at the end of 2016. Morningstar Data revenue increased by $19.1 million in 2018, as result of adding new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients by adding additional datasets primarily within our managed products and market data product lines.\nWith respect to indexes, European Union Benchmarks Regulation 2016/1011 came into force on June 30, 2016 with a majority of its provisions having a compliance date of January 1, 2018. The principal objective of the Regulation is to ensure benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (e.g., a tracking index of a ETF) are free of conflicts of interest, are used appropriately and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure. This Regulation applies to Morningstar's index group as a result of making available its indexes to European investable product sponsors (e.g., ETF sponsors) as the tracking index for their investable product.\nWe generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services. We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook Data, through license agreements. Our license agreements typically range from one to three years. We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions. These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.\nCloud Computing: On August 29, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and when an arrangement is solely a hosted CCA service. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The new guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued. Entities can choose to adopt the new guidance prospectively to eligible costs incurred on or after the date this guidance is first applied or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.\nWe believe these regulatory tends will continue in financial markets worldwide.\nIn 2018, operating expense increased $62.2 million, or 8.4%. Foreign currency translations increased our operating expense by $2.6 million in 2018.\nIncome Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income: On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act's reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized. We are evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRevenue from international operations increased $31.0 million, or 13.8%, in 2018 and $16.6 million, or 8.0% in 2017.\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2018 and 0.7 percentage points in 2017.\n \u2022 failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation; \nDepreciation expense rose $8.4 million in 2018, mainly driven by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development incurred over the past several years. Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.9 million in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.\n\n \u2022 liability relating to the acquisition or redistribution of data or information we acquire or errors included therein; and \n(14) License-based revenue includes Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Enterprise Components, Morningstar Research, PitchBook Data, and other similar products. License-based revenue during 2018 included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement.\nMost of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services. We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years. We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services. We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.\nOperating Expense\n(3) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals. The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase,\u201d decrease,\u201d grew,\u201d declined,\u201d was up,\u201d was down,\u201d was flat,\u201d or was similar\u201d refer to a comparison with the prior year unless otherwise stated.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $11.0 million in 2017 as revenue increased $113.1 million and operating expense increased $124.1 million. Operating margin was 18.6%, a decrease of 4.0 percentage points compared with 2016.\nAlthough actively-managed vehicles in aggregate experienced over $303.0 billion of outflows in 2018, most of the decline came from actively-managed U.S. equity mutual funds. Actively-managed ETFs attracted almost $27 billion of investor flows through 2018.\nThe amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions. The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations. To the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, changing to a territorial tax system and imposing a transitional tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective from January 1, 2018.\n(9) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Data revenue during 2018 by $1.5 million.\n(5) The 2017 decline was due to client losses related to a strategic shift away from our customized investment management offerings to Managed Portfolios. Also, 2017 and 2016 numbers were revised to exclude Australia and South Africa assets, which are reflected in Morningstar Managed Portfolios.\nConsolidated Revenue\nRevenue by region\nThe U.S. venture capital market also set a record in 2018 for the most capital ever invested in a single year. Driven by record amounts of capital invested in financing rounds of at least $100 million, roughly $131 billion in capital was invested. Over $55 billion in capital was raised by new vehicles, representing a 62.7% year-over-year increase and setting a record for the most capital raised in a single year. European markets also experienced a surge in total capital deployed by venture capital investors. Driven by an increase in the median deal size across all investment stages, over \u20ac20.5 billion was raised by European-headquartered startups in 2018, the largest figure in at least a decade.\n(13) Excluding the negative 6.5 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 9.7% for the full year in 2017. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018.\nThe European Commission announced its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance in May 2018. The proposed amendments would adjust the Benchmarks Regulation to create a new category of low-carbon and positive carbon benchmarks as well as change MiFID II to include ESG preferences in the advice they offer to investors. The Plan also proposed new regulations on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and risks and on the establishment of a unified classification system on what can be considered an environmentally sustainable economic activity.\nWe describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Operating Income and Operating Margin\n \u2022 an outage of our database, technology-based products and services, or network facilities or the movement of parts of our technology infrastructure to the public cloud; \n\nIn response to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the complexity in accounting which allowed SEC registrants to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the Tax Reform Act within the one-year measurement period required by SAB 118.\nWe make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection of the consideration to which we are entitled is probable. We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.\nIn December 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018. The authorization expires on December 31, 2020. In 2018, we repurchased a total of approximately 0.2 million shares for $20.9 million and had approximately $479.1 million available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2018.\n\nAcquisitions\nIn the European Union, the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), became effective in January 2018. The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance. If we determine a lower allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance. These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed. This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.\nNon-operating income in 2016 includes the $37.1 million gain we recorded with the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.\nOur investment management products have multiple fee structures, which vary by client and region. In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios. For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two. Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees. In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter. Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.\n \u2022 the failure of acquisitions and other investments to produce the results we anticipate; \nWe had 4,920 employees worldwide at the end of 2017, compared with 4,550 in 2016. This increase reflected continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including data operations in India and China and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nNMF - Not meaningful\nContractual Obligations\n\u2022 Depreciation and amortization. Our capital expenditures are mainly for capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements. We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter. We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years. We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.\nOrganic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.\nConsolidated operating income increased $46.0 million in 2018 as revenue increased $108.2 million and operating expense increased $62.2 million. Operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2017.\nAside from Morningstar Managed Portfolios, it's difficult for our Investment Management business to quantify these cash inflows and outflows. The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period. We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.\n\u2022 Revenue (including organic revenue);\nEquity in net loss of unconsolidated entities primarily reflects income from Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) offset by losses in our other equity method investments.\nIn the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally. Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.\nFor 2018, the $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement positively impacted operating income growth by 6.2 percentage points and operating margin by 0.8 percentage points. This recognition of revenue was not accompanied by a commensurate increase in operating expense.\nSales and marketing expense increased $36.7 million in 2017. Compensation expense increased $21.2 million due primarily to higher headcount at PitchBook. Sales commission expense also increased $12.6 million during 2017.\nEquity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Entities\nWe continually monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry. We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\n(2) The asset totals shown above (including assets we either manage directly or for which we provide consulting or subadvisory work) only include assets for which we receive basis-point fees. Some of our client contracts include services for which we receive a flat fee, but we do not include those assets in the total reported.\nIn 2018 and 2017, our consolidated revenue rose 11.9% and 14.2%, respectively. Foreign currency movements increased revenue by $4.0 million in 2018 and had no net material impact on revenue in 2017.\nCompensation expense increased $65.5 million in 2017 with bonus expense increasing $18.7 million. Bonus expense was higher due to stronger performance against our internal targets. Depreciation expense in 2017 included a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy.\nWe expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2019, primarily for computer hardware and software provided by third parties, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations. We continue to adopt more public cloud and software as a service applications for new initiatives and are in the process of migrating relevant parts of our data center to the public cloud over the next several years. During this migration, we expect to run certain applications and infrastructure in parallel. These actions will have some transitional effects on our level of capital expenditures and operating expenses.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n \u2022 volatility in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy and its effect on our revenue from asset-based fees and credit ratings business; \nIn addition to industry developments in 2018, there are several longer-term regulatory trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.\nOverall, depreciation and amortization increased $5.5 million, or 6.0%, in 2018 and $20.5 million, or 28.9%, in 2017.\nThe Year 2018 in Review\nIn Australia, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has been investigating banking and wealth management businesses. In a final report issued on February 1, 2019, the commission did not recommend the elimination of vertically integrated wealth management business models but has proposed a tighter set of rules around such vertical integration to make it more difficult to inappropriately incentivize the sale of financial products through aligned distribution channels. In particular financial advisers will be required to disclose to a client why they are not independent, impartial and unbiased before providing advice. The commission has also recommended a stronger regulatory presence with the imposition of more fines and an increase in enforcement litigation. The fund management industry also continues to be an area of regulatory reform with the introduction of the Asia Region Funds Passport and Corporate Collective Investment Vehicle Schemes, the review of fees and costs disclosure for managed investment and superannuation funds, and a suite of seven new and updated regulatory guides for the fund management industry.\nRising interest rates, especially at the long end of the yield curve, along with widening corporate bond credit spreads hampered fixed-income returns in 2018. Over the course of the year, the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds rose 27 basis points. The total annual return for Morningstar's Core Bond Index (our broadest measure of the fixed-income universe) was essentially unchanged for the year. Breaking the overall index down, Morningstar's Short-Term Core Bond Index rose approximately 1.5% and the Intermediate Core Bond Index rose 0.9%, but these gains were offset by the Long-Term Core Bond Index, which fell 3.2%.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had gross deferred tax assets of $37.9 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $58.1 million. The deferred tax assets include $2.4 million of deferred tax assets related to $10.6 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $2.0 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized. We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $1.0 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.\nRevenue\n \u2022 Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset. For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates. For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life. For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.  We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on our assessment of impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and \"whole of market\" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013. The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors. The U.K. regulator is monitoring the implementation of RDR and is scheduled to publish a review of its findings in 2019. In addition to the RDR, the U.K. regulator and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) launched the Financial Advice Market Review (FAMR) in 2015 in light of concerns that the market for financial advice was not working well for consumers. FAMR aimed to explore ways in which the government, industry, and regulators could take collective steps to stimulate the development of a market, which delivers affordable and accessible financial advice and guidance to everyone. FAMR's final report, published in March 2016, set out 28 recommendations intended to tackle barriers to consumers accessing advice. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HMT will review the outcomes of FAMR in 2019.\nBecause of timing differences required by tax law, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent. Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nWe generated free cash flow of $183.5 million in 2017, an increase of $32.6 million versus 2016. The change reflects a $36.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $3.8 million increase in capital expenditures.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content. While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low. This reflects our business focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management. At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results. During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate. When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nBased on PitchBook Platform data, on an aggregated basis, U.S. private capital markets experienced record performance in 2018, as evidenced by many different metrics. Over $713 billion worth of private equity-backed transactions were recorded across an estimated 4,828 completed deals, setting a record for the number of completed deals in a year. The total deal-value figure represented the second-highest yearly figure PitchBook has ever reported. In addition, despite significant volatility in various asset classes, valuations across private equity and M&A remained stable.\nDuring 2018, licensed-based revenue also included a $10.5 million revenue benefit related to an amended license agreement recorded in the third quarter.\nWe also generate transaction-based revenue, including the sale of advertising on our websites and sponsorship of conferences. In our credit ratings business, we primarily generate revenue through our provision of ratings on new issues of securities.\n\n(12) Morningstar did not acquire full ownership of PitchBook until December 2016; therefore 2016 results reflected one month of operations.\n \u2022 Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired. These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and noncompete agreements. \n\u2022 Cost of revenue. This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers. For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports. It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products. In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects. This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category. Cost of revenue also includes other expenses such as third-party data purchases and data lines.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-Operating Income\nRevenue from Morningstar Direct rose $13.5 million in 2018, reflecting growth in licenses for both new and existing clients and certain price increases. The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 15,033 worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 13,884 at the end of 2017 and 12,492 at the end of 2016, with growth in both the U.S. and internationally.\n\nNon-Operating Income, Equity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Entities, and Effective Tax Rate and Income Tax Expense\nForeign currency translation had a favorable effect of $4.0 million on revenue in 2018. Our 2017 results included revenue of $6.1 million from our divestitures of HelloWallet and our 15(c) board consulting services product line, which did not recur in 2018. Our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 also favorably impacted revenue by $6.7 million during 2018, primarily revenue from Institutional Asset Management and Morningstar Managed Portfolios. See Note 18 for additional information. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 11.4% in 2018.\nThe graph below illustrates our retention metrics over the past five years for contract-based products and services, primarily Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, PitchBook, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office.\nAllocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment. We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.\nKey Business Characteristics\nSome of the main contributors to the 2017 revenue increase were PitchBook Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Credit Ratings.\nInterest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio. Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility. Gain on sale of business relates to our sale of HelloWallet in June 2017. Gain on sale of product line relates to the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018. Gain on sale of equity investments relates to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership interest in Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) in the third quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated Operating Expense\nCost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services. We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.\nIn 2018, we also paid dividends of $42.6 million. In February 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2019 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2019. While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 28 cents per share in 2019.\nContingencies\nBased on Morningstar Asset Flows data, U.S. fund assets, composed of both long-term open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaled about $17.0 trillion as of December 31, 2018, compared with over $18.1 trillion as of December 31, 2017. Ending the year at approximately $3.4 trillion in assets under management, the U.S. ETF industry remained largely flat year-over-year, as market declines slightly offset investor inflows. In contrast, assets under management in U.S. long-term open-end funds declined to $13.6 trillion from $14.7 trillion in the prior year due to both market declines and investor outflows. In 2018, investors continued to favor passively-managed vehicles, with net inflows of more than $457.0 billion for passively managed funds and ETFs.\n\u2022 Free cash flow.\nDivestitures\nApproximately 67% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2018 was held by our operations outside the U.S., down from about 69% as of December 31, 2017. The amount of accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $209.2 million as of December 31, 2018. In February 2019, we repatriated approximately $45.8 million of these foreign earnings back to the U.S. Otherwise, we generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. We have not recorded deferred income taxes on the $209.2 million primarily because most of these earnings were previously subject to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax under that Tax Reform Act, which we recorded in 2017 as an expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.\n \u2022 trends in the asset management industry, including the decreasing popularity of actively managed investment vehicles and increased industry consolidation; \nThe tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue:\n\nWe include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories. Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, performance share awards, and market stock units.\nIn the United Kingdom, the FCA will also publish the final report of its Platforms Market Study in 2019. The Study explores the value offered, competition and whether the relationships between platforms, advisers, asset managers and fund ratings providers work in the interests of investors. Also, as of September 2019, U.K. fund managers must appoint a minimum of two independent directors to their boards and conduct an annual assessment of the value that they deliver to investors. These new rules are borne from the regulators Asset Management Market Study that sought to ensure fund managers compete on the value they deliver and act in the interests of investors.\n\u2022 General and administrative. This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments. It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.\nCompensation expense (which primarily consists of salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $33.4 million in 2018. Salary expense increased by $17.4 million, primarily driven by higher headcount at PitchBook. We accrued higher bonus expense of $16.5 million in 2018 due to stronger performance against our internal targets.\nWe use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities. It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority. We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.\n \u2022 inadequacy of our business continuity program in the event of a material emergency or adverse political or regulatory developments; \n\u2022 Sales and marketing. This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and marketing professionals. We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.\nAs a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was flat in 2018 and increased 2.5 percentage points in 2017.\n \u2022 failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy; \ninclude, among others:\nSignificant Operating Leverage\nWe generated free cash flow of $238.7 million in 2018, an increase of $55.2 million versus 2017. The change reflects a $64.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $9.5 million increase in capital expenditures.\nOur goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders. We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts, but may not build long-term shareholder value.\nWe paid a total of $193.0 million, less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years. We describe these acquisitions in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the U.S., the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) new fiduciary standard that would have expanded the definition of a fiduciary for certain financial advisors who provide advice related to retirement planning was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in March 2018. The new rule was previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017. In April 2018, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest\u201d and may finalize this rule in 2019. Regulation Best Interest echoes many of the principals of the DOL's rule, although it does not contain the same types of bright-line prohibitions on certain kinds of compensation, nor expose advisors to class-action lawsuits.\nDetermining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations, including the concentration of data and development work at our offshore facilities in China and India; \n(2) The minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $70.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $395.9 million, up $42.6 million from the end of 2017. The increase reflects cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds of $15.5 million related to the sale and purchase of investments, and proceeds of $10.5 million related to the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the first quarter of 2018. The sale of a portion of an equity-method investment also generated proceeds of $7.9 million. These items were partially offset by $110.0 million of repayments of long-term debt, $76.1 million of capital expenditures, dividends paid of $42.6 million, $20.9 million used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, and $13.3 million for employee taxes paid from withholding of restricted stock units. Purchases of equity-method investments of $7.4 million also offset the cash inflows.\nCost of revenue\nExcluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.\nIn 2017, international organic revenue increased 8.0%.\nWe invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers. We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities) at the end of 2018. For 2017, the amount of deferred revenue was $185.5 million (of which $171.3 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\nA more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\n(11) The adoption of ASC Topic 606 favorably impacted Morningstar Investment Management revenue during 2018 by $5.0 million.\n(15) Asset-based revenue includes Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Indexes.\n(4) 2017 and 2016 amounts are revised to include assets from Australia, which were previously reflected in Institutional Asset Management. 2016 was also revised to include assets from South Africa.\n(10) Restated from prior periods due to realignment of individual products within the product groups.\nThe tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue:\nThe table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:\nRefer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and the amounts that we recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, and for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate.\n \u2022 the failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of intellectual property infringement against us. \nPartially offsetting these increases was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. We accelerated development of our major software platforms, resulting in an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense. During 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million, associated with software development activities, mainly related to PitchBook, Morningstar Data, Workplace Solutions, and additional enhancements to reporting, financial planning, and other capabilities in our products. In comparison, we capitalized $28.2 million in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization\n(8) Key product and investment area revenue and revenue by type includes the effect of foreign currency translations.\nOrganic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nAsset-based revenue increased 10.0% during 2018, primarily driven by Morningstar Managed Portfolios and Workplace Solutions. The adoption of Topic 606 favorably impacted asset-based revenue growth by 2.7 percentage points during 2018. See Note 18 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 18) for additional information. Morningstar Investment Management revenue increased $10.2 million during 2018 due to growth in Morningstar Managed Portfolios offset by declines in institutional asset management. Workplace Solutions revenue increased 2.4% during 2018. Excluding the negative 4.6 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture in 2017, Workplace Solutions revenue increased by 7.0% for the full year in 2018. The asset-based revenue we earn in both Morningstar Investment Management and Workplace Solutions is generally based on average asset levels during each quarter. Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $200.1 billion in 2018, compared with $206.2 billion in 2017 and $192.0 billion in 2016.\n\nWe adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.\n \u2022 compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations; \nIn our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures. We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements. Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.\nHigher compensation expense, depreciation expense, professional fees, and sales commission expense were the main drivers that contributed to the increase in operating expense in 2017.\nWe offer an extensive line of products and services for individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors and other participants in the private capital markets. Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements. As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.\n \u2022 liability related to the storage of personal information related to individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information; \nAcquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\nRenewal Rates\nCost of revenue increased $42.3 million in 2017. Higher compensation expense of $36.1 million was the largest contributor to the increase with bonus expense increasing $12.0 million. Professional fees and production expense also contributed to the increase in this category.\nHigher internally developed capitalized software partially offset these increases. Continuous focus on development of our major software platforms, coupled with bringing new products and capabilities to market, resulted in an increase in capitalized software development, which in turn reduced operating expense. During 2018, we capitalized $53.5 million associated with software development activities, mainly related to enhanced capabilities in our products, internal infrastructure, and software, including PitchBook, Morningstar Cloud Platform, and Morningstar Enterprise Components. In comparison, we capitalized $46.3 million in 2017.\nDeferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue. Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and at the end of 2018, it totaled $210.0 million (of which $195.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.\n \u2022 failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools; \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $18.0 million, or 13.9%, during 2018. Compensation expense increased $5.8 million during 2018 with bonus expense increasing $2.9 million. Stock-based compensation increased $5.1 million due to accelerated vesting related to retirement or service provisions and more equity awards granted. Rent expense increased $2.1 million and software subscriptions increased $2.1 million during 2018.\n\nWe believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments. We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments. We invest a portion of our investment balance (approximately $24.1 million, or 91% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2018) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may,\u201d could,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d seek,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d or continue.\u201d These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect. For us, these risks and uncertainties\nWe had 5,416 employees worldwide at the end of 2018, compared with 4,920 in 2017. This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including operations in India and PitchBook in the U.S. and Europe.\nWe use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns. We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nPartially offsetting our 2017 total operating expense increase was an increase in internally developed capitalized software. In 2017, we capitalized $46.3 million of software development expense compared to $28.2 million of software development expense in 2016.\n\u2022 Operating income (loss); and\nGeneral and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was flat in 2018 and 1.0 percentage point in 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate in 2018 was 20.7%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 23.9% in 2017, primarily due to the 2018 tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act and also because of updates to our provisional tax estimates recorded in 2017.\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business. Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity. Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOffsetting these expenses in 2018 was an increase in capitalized software development of $7.2 million. Lower intangible amortization of $2.9 million also offset the increase in expenses in 2018 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized. Commission expense also decreased $2.9 million as a result of the adoption of Topic 606.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements. We account for certain minority-owned investments in international locations, including Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) and Sustainalytics Holding B.V.
