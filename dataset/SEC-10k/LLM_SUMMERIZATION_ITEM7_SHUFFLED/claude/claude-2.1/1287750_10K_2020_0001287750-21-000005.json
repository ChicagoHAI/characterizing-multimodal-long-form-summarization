Our actual results and condition could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in Risk Factors\u201d and the other information included in this Annual Report.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on information available to us on the filing date of this Annual Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act\u201d).\nWe are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ( Ares Capital Management\u201d or our investment adviser\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC ( Ares Operations\u201d or our administrator\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position) and second lien senior secured loans. In addition to senior secured loans, we also invest in subordinated loans (sometimes refer to as mezzanine debt), which in some cases includes an equity component and preferred equity.\nTo a lesser extent, we also make common equity investments, which have generally been non-control equity investments, of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments.\nSince our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2020, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 14% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $30.4 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $38.7 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 58% of these exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nAdditionally, since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2020, our realized gains have exceeded our realized losses by approximately $753 million (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation ( Allied Capital\u201d) in April 2010 (the Allied Acquisition\u201d) and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other transactions). For this same time period, our average annualized net realized gain rate was approximately 1.0% (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other\ntransactions). Net realized gain/loss rates for a particular period are the amount of net realized gains/losses during such period divided by the average quarterly investments at amortized cost in such period.\nInformation included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies\u201d (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.\nWe have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1 or 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time.\nSet forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in millions) </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCompanies </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grade 1 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grade 2 </td> <td>2,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grade 3 </td> <td>11,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grade 4 </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted average grade of the investments in our portfolio at fair value was 3.0 and 3.0, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was an increase in investments graded 1 and 2 and a resulting decline in the investments graded 3 as compared to as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to our view of the increased risk around our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investments given the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic so far and the continuing uncertainty surrounding its full duration and impact. For more information, see Results of Operations - Net Unrealized Gains/Losses.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, loans on non-accrual status represented 3.3% and 2.0% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, loans on non-accrual status represented 1.9% and 0.9% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively.\nSenior Direct Lending Program\nWe have established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, primarily to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d or the SDLP\u201d). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $350 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).\nWe provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the SDLP Certificates\u201d), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of December 31, 2020, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $6.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, in the aggregate, of which $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, is to be made available from us. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP. Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital funded to the SDLP(1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital funded to the SDLP by the Company(1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>909 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unfunded capital commitments to the SDLP(2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unfunded capital commitments to the SDLP by the Company(2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________\n(1) At principal amount.\n(2) These commitments to fund delayed draw loans have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded if and when conditions to funding such delayed draw loans are met.\nThe SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of our SDLP Certificates were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $909 million and $909 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Our yield on our investment in the SDLP Certificates at amortized cost and fair value was 13.5% and 13.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 14.5% and 14.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we earned interest income of $127 million, $122 million and $87 million, respectively, from our investment in the SDLP Certificates. We are also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SDLP. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in connection with the SDLP, we earned capital structuring service and other fees totaling $23 million, $25 million and $16 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the SDLP portfolio was comprised entirely of first lien senior secured loans primarily to U.S. middle-market companies and were in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of the loans were on non-accrual status. Below is a summary of the SDLP's portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total first lien senior secured loans(1)(2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield on first lien senior secured loans(3) </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest loan to a single borrower(1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total of five largest loans to borrowers(1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of borrowers in the SDLP </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to fund delayed draw loans(4) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)At principal amount.\n(2)First lien senior secured loans include certain loans that the SDLP classifies as unitranche\u201d loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total principal amount of loans in the SDLP portfolio that the SDLP classified as unitranche\u201d loans was $3,551 million and $3,643 million, respectively.\n(3) Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate on accruing first lien senior secured loans, divided by (b) total first lien senior secured loans at principal amount.\n(4)As discussed above, these commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP.\nSelected financial information for the SDLP as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Information: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments at fair value (amortized cost of $4,483 and $3,892, respectively) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,817 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediate funding notes </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities </td> <td>3,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,924 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated certificates and members' capital </td> <td>1,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and members' capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Statement of Operations Information: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized losses on investments </td> <td>(64) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in members' capital resulting from operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSDLP Loan Portfolio as of December 31, 2020\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in millions)\nPortfolio Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Business Description </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Stated Interest Rate(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADCS Clinics Intermediate Holdings, LLC (3) </td> <td> </td> <td>Dermatology practice </td> <td> </td> <td>5/2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AEP Holdings, Inc.

The decline in the weighted average yields for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 were primarily due to the decline in LIBOR. The average three-month LIBOR during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.65% compared to 2.33% during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average size and weighted average yield of our portfolio at amortized cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average size of portfolio </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,705 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield on portfolio </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in capital structuring service fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in new investment commitments. The volatility and disruption to the global economy and capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the pace of our investment activity during much of 2020, particularly in the second and third quarters, with a significant rebound of activity during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Effective June 21, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200% to 150%. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 1.20x as of December 31, 2020 from 0.95x as of December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in the total debt outstanding which increased our interest expense. The decrease in our weighted average stated interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decline in LIBOR, which lowered the stated interest rate on our revolving credit facilities. Average debt outstanding and weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average stated interest rate on debt </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBase management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the comparable period in 2019.\nIncome based fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2020 being lower than in the comparable period in 2019. Further, in connection with the acquisition of American Capital, Ltd. ( American Capital\u201d) (the American Capital Acquisition\u201d), Ares Capital Management waived $10 million of income based fees for each of the ten calendar quarters beginning with the second calendar quarter of 2017 and ending with the third calendar quarter of 2019 (the Fee Waiver\u201d). The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the Fee Waiver of $30 million.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the reduction in the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million and $4 million, respectively. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020 changed from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to net losses on investments, foreign currency and other transactions of $310 million compared to net losses of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of December 31, 2020, there was no capital gains incentive fee accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2019, the total capital gains incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.\nCash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by our investment adviser is deferred if, during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. Pursuant to these terms, payment of $83 million of the income based fees earned by our investment adviser for the second and third quarters of 2020 had been previously deferred. As of December 31, 2020, such deferred income based fees were payable under the terms of the investment advisory management agreement. There are currently no capital gains fees payable. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the related deferral terms.\nAdministrative fees represent fees paid to Ares Operations for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of our executive officers and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the administrative fees.\nOther general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent directors' fees.\nIncome Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must (among other requirements) meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of equity and debt securities, advances from the Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Funding Facility, SMBC Funding Facility and the BNP Funding Facility (each as defined below, and together, the Facilities\u201d), net proceeds from the issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes, as well as cash flows from operations.\nIn accordance with the Investment Company Act, we are allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowings (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us). As of December 31, 2020, we had $254 million in cash and cash equivalents and $8.6 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($8.5 billion at carrying value) and our asset coverage was 182%. Subject to borrowing base and other restrictions, we had approximately $3.3 billion available for additional borrowings under the Facilities as of December 31, 2020.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of common stock or outstanding debt, or incurrence or issuance of additional debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.\nEquity Capital Activities\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total equity market capitalization was $7.1 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively.\nWe are party to equity distribution agreements with two sales agents (the Equity Distribution Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500 million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreements, sales of common stock, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

As of December 31, 2020, common stock with an aggregate offering amount of $431 million remained available for issuance under the Equity Distribution Agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, in addition to equity issuances under the Equity Distribution Agreements, we also issued common stock in connection with our dividend reinvestment program. There were no other issuances of our equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe are authorized under our stock repurchase program to purchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The program does not require us to\nrepurchase any specific number of shares, and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The expiration date of the stock repurchase program is February 15, 2021. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cumulatively repurchased a total of 9.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the stock repurchase program since its inception in September 2015, at an average price of $11.95 per share, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $393 million available for additional repurchases under the program.

Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).\nAlso included within the total revolving loan commitments as of December 31, 2020 were commitments to issue up to $375 million in letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2020, we had $72 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $63 million expire in 2021 and $9 million expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a liability of $1 million for certain letters of credit issued and outstanding and none of the other letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as such other letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.\nWe also have commitments to co-invest in the SDLP for our portion of the SDLP's commitments to fund delayed draw loans to certain portfolio companies of the SDLP. See Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total private equity commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: funded private equity commitments </td> <td>(68) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unfunded private equity commitments </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: private equity commitments substantially our discretion </td> <td>(43) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net adjusted unfunded private equity commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may sell certain of our investments to third party purchasers. In particular, in connection with the sale of certain controlled portfolio company equity investments (as well as certain other sales), we have, and may continue to do so in the future, agreed to indemnify such purchasers for future liabilities arising from the investments and the related sale transaction. Such indemnification provisions have given rise to liabilities in the past and may do so in the future.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may guarantee certain obligations in connection with our portfolio companies (in particular, certain controlled portfolio companies). Under these guarantee arrangements, payments may be required to be made to third parties if such guarantees are called upon or if the portfolio companies were to default on their related obligations, as applicable.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn January 2021, we issued $650 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 2.150% per annum and mature on July 15, 2026 (the \u2018\u2018July 2026 Notes''). The July 2026 Notes pay interest semi-annually and all principal is due upon maturity. The July 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option at the redemption prices determined pursuant to the indenture governing the July 2026 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. The July 2026 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount.\nIn February 2021, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our existing stock repurchase program to (a) extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2021 to February 15, 2022 and (b) increase the amount of the stock repurchase program to a full $500 million. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nFrom January 1, 2021 through February 4, 2021, we made new investment commitments of approximately $524 million, of which $411 million were funded. Of these new commitments, 86% were in first lien senior secured loans, 9% were in senior subordinated loans and 5% were in second lien senior secured loans. Of the approximately $524 million of new investment commitments, 83% were floating rate, 16% were fixed rate and 1% was on non-accrual status. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 8.0%. We may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nFrom January 1, 2021 through February 4, 2021, we exited approximately $1.1 billion of investment commitments, including $260 million of loans sold to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. Of the total investment commitments exited, 72% were first lien senior secured loans, 11% were second lien senior secured loans, 9% were senior subordinated loans, 7% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP and 1% were other equity securities. Of the approximately $1.1 billion of exited investment commitments, 91% were floating rate, 6% were fixed rate, 2% were on non-accrual status and 1% were non-interest bearing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 9.0%, and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 8.7%. On the approximately $1.1 billion of investment commitments exited from January 1, 2021 through February 4, 2021, we recognized total net realized gains of approximately $13 million. There were no realized gains or losses recognized from the sale of loans to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM.\nIn addition, as of February 4, 2021, we had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $685 million and $280 million, respectively. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by our investment adviser's investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore we believe are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our critical accounting policies.\nInvestments\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off\nduring the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of our investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of our investment adviser, audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a portion of our investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our investment valuation process within the context of performing the integrated audit.\nAs part of the valuation process, we may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation.\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.\nOur board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team.\n\u2022Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with our investment adviser's management and investment professionals, and then valuation recommendations are presented to our board of directors.\n\u2022The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these valuations, as well as the input of third parties, including independent third-party valuation firms who have reviewed a portion of the investments in our portfolio at fair value.\n\u2022Our board of directors discusses valuations and ultimately determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of our investment adviser, audit committee and, where applicable, independent third-party valuation firms.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe follow ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASC 825-10\u201d), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of the company's choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled other assets\u201d and debt,\u201d which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value.\nWe also follow ASC 820-10, which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:\n\u2022Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n\u2022Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n\u2022Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nIn addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we continue to employ the net asset valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820-10. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Our valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.\nOur portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ( EV\u201d) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where the we do not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction\nmarket, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nFor other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.\nThe SEC recently adopted new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. This establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We will comply with the new rule's valuation requirements on or before the SEC's compliance date in 2022.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our valuation process.", "item_7_truncated": "See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our debt obligations.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income received from IHAM </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring dividends </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurring dividends </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dividend income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may sell certain of our investments to third party purchasers.

The SMBC Funding Facility also provides for a feature that allows ACJB, subject to receiving certain consents, to increase the overall size of the SMBC Funding Facility to $1.0 billion. The SMBC Funding Facility is secured by all of the assets held by ACJB. The end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date for the SMBC Funding Facility are September 10, 2022 and September 10, 2024, respectively. The reinvestment period and the stated maturity date are both subject to two one-year extensions by mutual agreement. The interest rate charged on the SMBC Funding Facility is based on an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 2.00% over LIBOR or 0.75% or 1.00% over a base rate\u201d (as defined in the agreements governing the SMBC Funding Facility), in each case, determined monthly based on the amount of the average borrowings outstanding under the SMBC Funding Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 1.75%.

Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1 or 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time.\nWe have issued $388 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on February 1, 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) and $403 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on March 1, 2024 (the 2024 Convertible Notes\u201d and together with the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Unsecured Notes\u201d).

Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d or the SDLP\u201d). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $350 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).\n\u2022our ability to successfully complete and integrate any acquisitions;\nThe amortized cost and fair value of our SDLP Certificates were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $909 million and $909 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Our yield on our investment in the SDLP Certificates at amortized cost and fair value was 13.5% and 13.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 14.5% and 14.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we earned interest income of $127 million, $122 million and $87 million, respectively, from our investment in the SDLP Certificates. We are also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SDLP. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in connection with the SDLP, we earned capital structuring service and other fees totaling $23 million, $25 million and $16 million, respectively.\nduring the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nWe follow ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASC 825-10\u201d), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of the company's choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled other assets\u201d and debt,\u201d which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nRevolving Funding Facility\n(4)As discussed above, these commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP.\n\nSelected financial information for the SDLP as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was as follows:\n(6)Number of new investment commitments represents each commitment to a particular portfolio company or a commitment to multiple companies as part of an individual transaction (e.g., the purchase of a portfolio of investments).\n\u2022market conditions and our ability to access alternative debt markets and additional debt and equity capital and our ability to manage our capital resources effectively;\n\u2022the impact of global health epidemics, such as the current novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic, on our or our portfolio companies' business and the global economy;\n\u2022uncertainty surrounding the financial stability of the United States, Europe and China;\n\nOther general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent directors' fees.\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.\nFor other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\n(1) Represents the total aggregate amount committed or outstanding, as applicable, under such instrument.

Of these new commitments, 86% were in first lien senior secured loans, 9% were in senior subordinated loans and 5% were in second lien senior secured loans. Of the approximately $524 million of new investment commitments, 83% were floating rate, 16% were fixed rate and 1% was on non-accrual status.

Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Our valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nJanuary 2026 Notes\n\u2022Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)Represents the weighted average annual stated interest rate as of December 31, 2020.

ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity.

The income tax expense for our taxable consolidated subsidiaries will vary depending on the level of realized gains from the exits of investments held by such taxable subsidiaries during the respective periods.\n\u2022our expected financings and investments;\n(5)See Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d below and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on the SDLP (as defined below).\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOVERVIEW\nOur investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position) and second lien senior secured loans. In addition to senior secured loans, we also invest in subordinated loans (sometimes refer to as mezzanine debt), which in some cases includes an equity component and preferred equity.\n\u2022our ability to recover unrealized losses;\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes.\nSenior Direct Lending Program\n\u2022our, or our portfolio companies', future business, operations, operating results or prospects;\nWe are authorized under our stock repurchase program to purchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The program does not require us to\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships as follows:\nInformation included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured.\nWe have issued $1,150 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 3.875% per annum (the \u2018\u2018January 2026 Notes''). The January 2026 Notes pay interest semi-annually, and all principal is due upon maturity. The January 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option at a redemption price equal to par plus a \u2018\u2018make whole'' premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the January 2026 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest.\n(9) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the July 2025 Notes (as defined below), less unamortized debt issuance costs and the unaccreted discount recorded upon the issuance of the July 2025 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the total unamortized debt issuance costs and unaccreted discount was $8 million.\nWe also have commitments to co-invest in the SDLP for our portion of the SDLP's commitments to fund delayed draw loans to certain portfolio companies of the SDLP. See Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information.\n(1) Represents conversion price and conversion rate, as applicable, as of December 31, 2020, taking into account any applicable de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date.\n\u2022the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our business;\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of common stock or outstanding debt, or incurrence or issuance of additional debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.\n\u2022the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; and\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our operating results were negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and negatively impacted the fair value and performance of certain portfolio companies in our investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net unrealized losses recorded on investments were primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including from business shutdowns, government restrictions and/or possible additional liquidity needs of certain of our portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\n\nSince our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2020, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 14% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $30.4 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $38.7 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 58% of these exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nWe have various commitments to fund investments in our portfolio, as described below.\n\n(4)The end of the reinvestment period for the BNP Funding Facility is June 11, 2023. Subsequent to the end of this reinvestment period and prior to the stated maturity date of June 11, 2025, any principal proceeds from sales and repayments of loan assets held by AFB will be used to repay the aggregate principal amount outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $6.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, in the aggregate, of which $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, is to be made available from us. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP. \nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of equity and debt securities, advances from the Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Funding Facility, SMBC Funding Facility and the BNP Funding Facility (each as defined below, and together, the Facilities\u201d), net proceeds from the issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes, as well as cash flows from operations.\n\n\u2022the impact of the elimination of the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) on our operating results;\n(3)We also hold a portion of this company's first lien senior secured loan.\nSee Recent Developments,\u201d as well as Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a subsequent event relating to an additional issuance of unsecured notes.\n________________________________________\n(5)We are obligated under a number of operating leases and subleases to pay for office spaces with terms ranging from approximately one to six years. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our lease obligations.\nStated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to the increase in the average principal amount of debt outstanding. Effective June 21, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200% to 150%. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 1.20x as of December 31, 2020 from 0.95x as of December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in the total debt outstanding which increased our interest expense. The decrease in our weighted average stated interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decline in LIBOR, which lowered the stated interest rate on our revolving credit facilities. Average debt outstanding and weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\u2022the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market;\nThe net realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investments consisted of the following:\n(1)As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our investments was negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2047 Notes pay interest quarterly, and all principal is due upon maturity. The 2047 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option, at a par redemption price of $25.00 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n(2)First lien senior secured loans include certain loans that the SDLP classifies as unitranche\u201d loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total principal amount of loans in the SDLP portfolio that the SDLP classified as unitranche\u201d loans was $3,551 million and $3,643 million, respectively.\nAlso included within the total revolving loan commitments as of December 31, 2020 were commitments to issue up to $375 million in letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2020, we had $72 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $63 million expire in 2021 and $9 million expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a liability of $1 million for certain letters of credit issued and outstanding and none of the other letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as such other letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.\nWe provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the SDLP Certificates\u201d), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of December 31, 2020, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.\n___________________________________________________________________________\n(2) These commitments to fund delayed draw loans have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded if and when conditions to funding such delayed draw loans are met.\nWe use words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d may\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words.

The 2022 Notes pay interest semi-annually, and all principal is due upon maturity. The 2022 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option at a redemption price equal to par plus a make whole\u201d premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of our investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of our investment adviser, audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a portion of our investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our investment valuation process within the context of performing the integrated audit.\nSDLP Loan Portfolio as of December 31, 2019\nrepurchase any specific number of shares, and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The expiration date of the stock repurchase program is February 15, 2021. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe are party to equity distribution agreements with two sales agents (the Equity Distribution Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500 million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreements, sales of common stock, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company's at the market offering\u201d activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below:\nOur board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Notes (as defined below), less unamortized debt issuance costs and the net unaccreted discount recorded upon the issuance of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total unamortized debt issuance costs and the unaccreted discount were $2 million and $3 million, respectively.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may guarantee certain obligations in connection with our portfolio companies (in particular, certain controlled portfolio companies). Under these guarantee arrangements, payments may be required to be made to third parties if such guarantees are called upon or if the portfolio companies were to default on their related obligations, as applicable.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nThe net realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\n\u2022the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;\n\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies\u201d (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.\nOur portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ( EV\u201d) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where the we do not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction\nIn February 2021, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our existing stock repurchase program to (a) extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2021 to February 15, 2022 and (b) increase the amount of the stock repurchase program to a full $500 million. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\n(1)The net unrealized (appreciation) depreciation reversed related to net realized gains or losses represents the unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded on the related asset at the end of the prior period.\nSee Recent Developments,\u201d as well as Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a subsequent event relating to our stock repurchase program.\n(1)At principal amount.\nSet forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the reduction in the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million and $4 million, respectively. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020 changed from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to net losses on investments, foreign currency and other transactions of $310 million compared to net losses of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of December 31, 2020, there was no capital gains incentive fee accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2019, the total capital gains incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.\nmaturity date are March 30, 2023 and March 30, 2024, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of $5.4 billion. The interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 1.875% over LIBOR or 0.75% or 0.875% over an alternate base rate\u201d (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility), in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 1.75%. We are also required to pay a letter of credit fee of either 2.00% or 2.125% per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base\n(2) Weighted average yields\u201d are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total relevant investments at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable.\n(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Convertible Unsecured Notes (as defined below). As of December 31, 2020, the total unamortized debt issuance costs and the unaccreted discount for the 2022 Convertible\n(1) At principal amount.\n2022 Notes\n\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a net expense of $17 million and $15 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\n________________________________________\nOperating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\u2022the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business;\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 located within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(3)Includes both funded and unfunded commitments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, investment commitments exited included exits of unfunded commitments of $798 million and $718 million, respectively.\nBNP Funding Facility\nThe SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.\nInvestment Income\nThe decrease in capital structuring service fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in new investment commitments. The volatility and disruption to the global economy and capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the pace of our investment activity during much of 2020, particularly in the second and third quarters, with a significant rebound of activity during the fourth quarter of 2020. The new investment commitments and weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(3)The proceeds from these certificates were applied to co-investments with Varagon Capital Partners ( Varagon\u201d) and its clients to fund first lien senior secured loans to 23 and 23 different borrowers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ( Ares Capital Management\u201d or our investment adviser\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC ( Ares Operations\u201d or our administrator\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\n(1)Represents the weighted average annual stated interest rate as of December 31, 2019. All interest rates are payable in cash.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our critical accounting policies.\nCash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by our investment adviser is deferred if, during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. Pursuant to these terms, payment of $83 million of the income based fees earned by our investment adviser for the second and third quarters of 2020 had been previously deferred. As of December 31, 2020, such deferred income based fees were payable under the terms of the investment advisory management agreement. There are currently no capital gains fees payable. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the related deferral terms.\nIncome based fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2020 being lower than in the comparable period in 2019. Further, in connection with the acquisition of American Capital, Ltd.

Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nAs part of the valuation process, we may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation.\n\u2022Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nIncluded within the total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were delayed draw loan commitments totaling $652 million and $633 million, respectively. Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).\n\n(11) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2047 Notes (as defined below), less unamortized debt issuance costs and unaccreted discount recorded as part of the Allied Acquisition.

As of December 31, 2020, there was an increase in investments graded 1 and 2 and a resulting decline in the investments graded 3 as compared to as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to our view of the increased risk around our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investments given the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic so far and the continuing uncertainty surrounding its full duration and impact. For more information, see Results of Operations - Net Unrealized Gains/Losses.\u201d\nThe weighted average stated interest rate and weighted average maturity, both on aggregate principal amount outstanding, of all our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were 3.4% and 4.2 years, respectively, and as of December 31, 2019 were 3.9% and 4.7 years, respectively.\n\nNotes and the 2024 Convertible Notes (each as defined below) were $5 million and $11 million, respectively.

Investment backlog includes transactions approved by our investment adviser's investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore we believe are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments.\nIn certain circumstances, assuming the respective conversion date below has not already passed, the Convertible Unsecured Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at their respective conversion rates (listed below as of December 31, 2020) subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the requirements of their respective indenture (the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures\u201d).

On or after their respective conversion dates until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes and the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date for the 2024 Convertible Notes, holders may convert their Convertible Unsecured Notes at any time. In addition, if we engage in certain corporate events as described in their respective Convertible Unsecured Notes Indenture, holders of the Convertible Unsecured Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the Convertible Unsecured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Unsecured Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.\n(1)New investment commitments include new agreements to fund revolving loans or delayed draw loans.

Of the total investment commitments exited, 72% were first lien senior secured loans, 11% were second lien senior secured loans, 9% were senior subordinated loans, 7% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP and 1% were other equity securities. Of the approximately $1.1 billion of exited investment commitments, 91% were floating rate, 6% were fixed rate, 2% were on non-accrual status and 1% were non-interest bearing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 9.0%, and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 8.7%. On the approximately $1.1 billion of investment commitments exited from January 1, 2021 through February 4, 2021, we recognized total net realized gains of approximately $13 million.

The decline in the weighted average yields for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 were primarily due to the decline in LIBOR. The average three-month LIBOR during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.65% compared to 2.33% during the year ended December 31, 2019. The average size and weighted average yield of our portfolio at amortized cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nAres Capital Management, our investment adviser, employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1 or 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time.\nWe have issued $388 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on February 1, 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) and $403 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on March 1, 2024 (the 2024 Convertible Notes\u201d and together with the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Unsecured Notes\u201d).

Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the Senior Direct Lending Program\u201d or the SDLP\u201d). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $350 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).\n\u2022our ability to successfully complete and integrate any acquisitions;\nThe amortized cost and fair value of our SDLP Certificates were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $909 million and $909 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Our yield on our investment in the SDLP Certificates at amortized cost and fair value was 13.5% and 13.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 14.5% and 14.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we earned interest income of $127 million, $122 million and $87 million, respectively, from our investment in the SDLP Certificates. We are also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SDLP.

Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nWe follow ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASC 825-10\u201d), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of the company's choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled other assets\u201d and debt,\u201d which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nRevolving Funding Facility\n(4)As discussed above, these commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP.\n\nSelected financial information for the SDLP as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was as follows:\n(6)Number of new investment commitments represents each commitment to a particular portfolio company or a commitment to multiple companies as part of an individual transaction (e.g., the purchase of a portfolio of investments).\n\u2022market conditions and our ability to access alternative debt markets and additional debt and equity capital and our ability to manage our capital resources effectively;\n\u2022the impact of global health epidemics, such as the current novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic, on our or our portfolio companies' business and the global economy;\n\u2022uncertainty surrounding the financial stability of the United States, Europe and China;\n\nOther general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent directors' fees.\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.\nFor other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\n(1) Represents the total aggregate amount committed or outstanding, as applicable, under such instrument.

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements.\nWe are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), that allows us to borrow up to $3.6 billion at any one time outstanding. The Revolving Credit Facility consists of a $740 million term loan tranche and a $2.9 billion revolving tranche. For $699 million of the term loan tranche, the stated maturity date is March 30, 2025. For the remaining $41 million of the term loan tranche, the stated maturity date is March 30, 2024. For $2.7 billion of the revolving tranche, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are March 30, 2024 and March 30, 2025, respectively.

Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Our valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nJanuary 2026 Notes\n\u2022Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)Represents the weighted average annual stated interest rate as of December 31, 2020.

ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net unrealized losses recorded on investments were primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including from business shutdowns, government restrictions and/or possible additional liquidity needs of certain of our portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\n\nSince our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) on October 8, 2004 through December 31, 2020, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 14% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $30.4 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $38.7 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 58% of these exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nWe have various commitments to fund investments in our portfolio, as described below.\n\n(4)The end of the reinvestment period for the BNP Funding Facility is June 11, 2023.

Effective June 21, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200% to 150%. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 1.20x as of December 31, 2020 from 0.95x as of December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in the total debt outstanding which increased our interest expense. The decrease in our weighted average stated interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decline in LIBOR, which lowered the stated interest rate on our revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $72 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $63 million expire in 2021 and $9 million expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a liability of $1 million for certain letters of credit issued and outstanding and none of the other letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as such other letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.\nWe provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the SDLP Certificates\u201d), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates.

The 2022 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option at a redemption price equal to par plus a make whole\u201d premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of our investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of our investment adviser, audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a portion of our investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our investment valuation process within the context of performing the integrated audit.\nSDLP Loan Portfolio as of December 31, 2019\nrepurchase any specific number of shares, and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The expiration date of the stock repurchase program is February 15, 2021. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe are party to equity distribution agreements with two sales agents (the Equity Distribution Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500 million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreements, sales of common stock, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company's at the market offering\u201d activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below:\nOur board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Notes (as defined below), less unamortized debt issuance costs and the net unaccreted discount recorded upon the issuance of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total unamortized debt issuance costs and the unaccreted discount were $2 million and $3 million, respectively.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may guarantee certain obligations in connection with our portfolio companies (in particular, certain controlled portfolio companies). Under these guarantee arrangements, payments may be required to be made to third parties if such guarantees are called upon or if the portfolio companies were to default on their related obligations, as applicable.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\nThe net realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\n\u2022the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;\n\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets,\u201d including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies\u201d (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.\nOur portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ( EV\u201d) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where the we do not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction\nIn February 2021, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our existing stock repurchase program to (a) extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2021 to February 15, 2022 and (b) increase the amount of the stock repurchase program to a full $500 million. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\n(1)The net unrealized (appreciation) depreciation reversed related to net realized gains or losses represents the unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded on the related asset at the end of the prior period.\nSee Recent Developments,\u201d as well as Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a subsequent event relating to our stock repurchase program.\n(1)At principal amount.\nSet forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the reduction in the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million and $4 million, respectively. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020 changed from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to net losses on investments, foreign currency and other transactions of $310 million compared to net losses of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of December 31, 2020, there was no capital gains incentive fee accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2019, the total capital gains incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP was $58 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.\nmaturity date are March 30, 2023 and March 30, 2024, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of $5.4 billion. The interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 1.875% over LIBOR or 0.75% or 0.875% over an alternate base rate\u201d (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility), in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 1.75%. We are also required to pay a letter of credit fee of either 2.00% or 2.125% per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base\n(2) Weighted average yields\u201d are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total relevant investments at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable.\n(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Convertible Unsecured Notes (as defined below). As of December 31, 2020, the total unamortized debt issuance costs and the unaccreted discount for the 2022 Convertible\n(1) At principal amount.\n2022 Notes\n\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a net expense of $17 million and $15 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.\n________________________________________\nOperating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\u2022the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business;\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 located within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(3)Includes both funded and unfunded commitments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, investment commitments exited included exits of unfunded commitments of $798 million and $718 million, respectively.\nBNP Funding Facility\nThe SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.\nInvestment Income\nThe decrease in capital structuring service fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in new investment commitments. The volatility and disruption to the global economy and capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the pace of our investment activity during much of 2020, particularly in the second and third quarters, with a significant rebound of activity during the fourth quarter of 2020. The new investment commitments and weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(3)The proceeds from these certificates were applied to co-investments with Varagon Capital Partners ( Varagon\u201d) and its clients to fund first lien senior secured loans to 23 and 23 different borrowers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ( Ares Capital Management\u201d or our investment adviser\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC ( Ares Operations\u201d or our administrator\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\n(1)Represents the weighted average annual stated interest rate as of December 31, 2019. All interest rates are payable in cash.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more information on our critical accounting policies.\nCash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by our investment adviser is deferred if, during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. Pursuant to these terms, payment of $83 million of the income based fees earned by our investment adviser for the second and third quarters of 2020 had been previously deferred. As of December 31, 2020, such deferred income based fees were payable under the terms of the investment advisory management agreement. There are currently no capital gains fees payable. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information on the related deferral terms.\nIncome based fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2020 being lower than in the comparable period in 2019. Further, in connection with the acquisition of American Capital, Ltd. ( American Capital\u201d) (the American Capital Acquisition\u201d), Ares Capital Management waived $10 million of income based fees for each of the ten calendar quarters beginning with the second calendar quarter of 2017 and ending with the third calendar quarter of 2019 (the Fee Waiver\u201d). The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the Fee Waiver of $30 million.\nConvertible Unsecured Notes\n(1) Weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities\u201d is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total accruing debt and other income producing securities at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable.\nThe weighted average yields at amortized cost and fair value of the following portions of our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off\n2047 Notes\n\nWe value our portfolio investments quarterly and the changes in value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were comprised of the following:\n(4)For the year ended December 31, 2020, net repayments of first lien secured revolving loans were $29 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net fundings of first lien secured revolving loans were $65 million.\n\u2022the social, geopolitical, financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit;\nThe net realized gains (losses) from the sales, repayments or exits of investments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized net realized losses on foreign currency and other transactions of $18 million.\nWe and our consolidated subsidiary, ARCC FB Funding LLC ( AFB\u201d), are party to a revolving funding facility (as amended, the BNP Funding Facility\u201d) with AFB, as the borrower, and BNP Paribas, as the administrative agent and lender, that allows AFB to borrow up to $300 million at any one time outstanding. The BNP Funding Facility is secured by all of the assets held by AFB. The end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date for the BNP Funding Facility are June 11, 2023 and June 11, 2025, respectively. The reinvestment period and the stated maturity date are both subject to a one-year extension by mutual agreement. The interest rate charged on the BNP Funding Facility is based on three month LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.45%), or over a base rate\u201d (as defined in the agreements governing the BNP Funding Facility) plus a margin that generally ranges between 2.65% and 3.15% (depending on the types of assets such advances relate to), with a weighted average floor for all classes of advances of (i) 2.75% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.25% following the reinvestment period. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 2.88%. Beginning on December 11, 2020, AFB is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.00% and 1.25% per annum depending on the size of the unused portion of the BNP Funding Facility. Prior to December 11, 2020, there was no commitment fee required to be paid. As of December 31, 2020, there was $150 million outstanding under the BNP Funding Facility and we and AFB were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the BNP Funding Facility.\n\u2022Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nOur debt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, loans on non-accrual status represented 3.3% and 2.0% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, loans on non-accrual status represented 1.9% and 0.9% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, in addition to equity issuances under the Equity Distribution Agreements, we also issued common stock in connection with our dividend reinvestment program. There were no other issuances of our equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2)Represents the fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820-10\u201d).
