MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nSohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, is a leading Chinese online media, search and game service group providing comprehensive online products and services on PCs and mobile devices in the People's Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d). Our businesses are conducted by Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and VIEs (collectively referred to as the \u201cSohu Group\u201d or the \u201cGroup\u201d). The Sohu Group consists of Sohu, which when referred to in this report, unless the context requires otherwise, excludes the businesses and the corresponding subsidiaries and VIEs of Sogou Inc. (\u201cSogou\u201d) and Changyou.com Limited (\u201cChangyou\u201d), Sogou and Changyou. Sogou and Changyou are indirect controlled subsidiaries of Sohu.com Inc. Sohu is a leading Chinese language online media content and services provider. Sogou is a leading online search, client software and mobile Internet product provider in China. Changyou is a leading online game developer and operator in China as measured by the popularity of its PC game TLBB and its mobile game TLBB 3D, and engages primarily in the development, operation and licensing of online games for PCs and mobile devices. Most of our operations are conducted through our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs.\nThrough the operation of Sohu, Sogou and Changyou, we generate online advertising revenues (including brand advertising revenues and search and search-related revenues), online games revenues and other revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total revenues were approximately $1.65 billion, representing an decrease of 15% compared to 2015, and our gross margin decreased from 56% to 48%. Our online advertising business generated revenues of $1.05 billion, with a 6% annual decline, representing 63% of total revenues. Our online game business generated revenues of $395.7 million, with a 38% annual decline, representing 24% of total revenues. In 2016, our net loss before deducting the noncontrolling interest was $119.3 million, compared to net profit of $108.9 million in 2015. In 2016, our net loss after deducting the noncontrolling interest was $224.0 million, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million in 2015. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. was $5.83 in 2016, compared to a diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. of $1.32 in 2015.\nFactors and Trends Affecting our Business\nWith the accelerated shift in user activities from PCs to mobile devices and an increase in the number of Internet users, the use of various kinds of mobile Internet services continued to increase. As of the end of December 2016, according to China Internet Network Information Center (\u201cCNNIC\u201d), mobile internet users had reached 695 million, an increase of 12% from the end of 2015. At Sohu, we focused our efforts on developing a portfolio of leading mobile products across our business lines that we believed our users would like.\nFor Sohu Media Portal, we concentrated our focus on content and product design to accelerate the usage of our core mobile products - the Sohu News APP and the Web-based HTML5 Portal m.sohu.com. During 2016, we continued to optimize Sohu News App's design and introduce new features to meet users' appetites. At the same time, we ramped up marketing and promotion activities to accelerate the product's penetration. Daily active users of Sohu News APP continued to gain traction. On the sales front, in 2016 we experienced a modest decline in revenue for Sohu Media Portal as advertising revenues from large brand advertisers were soft due to the sluggish Chinese economy, while solid growth from small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers partially offset the negative impact.\nOnline video services remained one of the most popular Internet applications, and continued to gain viewers from television stations. The video industry continued to be deeply competitive as major online platforms aggressively competed for popular content. The competition led to an escalation in the price of content. During 2016, Sohu Video began to shift our focus to the self-developed content category, which, in our view, will create long-lasting value to our platform and offer better financial returns compared to TV station content. Leveraging our exclusive original content, we also actively explored opportunities with subscription services that we believe will become an important revenue source in addition to traditional advertising revenues. Financially, Sohu Video's revenues for 2016 were affected by the weak economy and a turnover of the video sales team in the middle of the year, and its loss-making widened from 2015.\nFor our search and search-related business, Sogou is one of the top players in the online search sector in China. We have reinforced our competitive position through cooperation with Tencent, which has helped us build exclusive access to Tencent's social platforms and bring in unique and high-quality content. In 2016, we launched and upgraded a series of vertical channels, including English, Academic and Healthcare. These new services helped us stand out from competing products. By the end of December 2016, Sogou's mobile search traffic grew 70% from the same period in 2015, contributing 75% of aggregate traffic. Mobile search revenues accounted for two-thirds of total search revenues. During 2016, we also made solid progress in artificial intelligence, in particular with voice technology. The daily use of voice input through Sogou Mobile Keyboard more than doubled from a year ago. Due to newly-imposed regulations for online advertising that tightened the scrutiny of advertiser qualifications, Sogou's revenue growth for 2016 decelerated from previous years'.\nFor Changyou's PC game business, the PC game TLBB experienced a relatively large drop in revenue at the beginning of 2016, and Changyou immediately adjusted its operational strategy to focus on user stabilization by cutting down on the number of in-game promotions, improving in-game content and strengthening social functionality. The revenues of TLBB remained stable throughout the year, with slight increases in the third and fourth quarters on a sequential basis. For Changyou's mobile game business, revenues from TLBB 3D declined sequentially mainly due to its natural declining life cycle. In order to extend the game's life span, Changyou will explore new social interactive features that can be added to the game. Overall, Changyou started at the beginning of 2016 to focus on producing high-quality games. This approach and higher testing standards have set the bar high for new games in the pipeline, which had an impact on 2016 revenues. Nevertheless, after a year of hard work, Changyou now has a solid pipeline with a focus on MMORPG games, and supplemented by a number of advanced casual games in 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the PC games and mobile games that Changyou operates had approximately 4.1 million total average monthly active accounts and approximately 1.4 million total active paying accounts.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Identified below are the accounting policies that reflect our most significant estimates and judgments, and those that we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nVIE Consolidation\nOur VIEs are wholly or partially owned by certain of our employees as nominee shareholders. For our consolidated VIEs, management made evaluations of the relationships between us and our VIEs and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of such contractual arrangements, we control the shareholders' voting interests in these VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of our consolidated VIEs.\nNoncontrolling Interest Recognition\nNoncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity of subsidiaries and VIEs which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the controlling shareholder. Currently, the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of noncontrolling interests for Sogou and Changyou.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Sogou\nSogou's Share Structure\nAs of December 31, 2016, Sogou had outstanding a combined total of 334,746,495 ordinary shares and preferred shares held as follows:\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>(i) </td> <td>Sohu.com Inc.: 131,697,750 Class A Ordinary Shares, of which 4,484,500 shares may be purchased by Sohu management and key employees under an option arrangement; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>(ii) </td> <td>Photon Group Limited, an investment vehicle of the Sohu Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Zhang (\u201cPhoton\u201d): 32,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>(iii) </td> <td>Tencent: 6,757,875 Class A Ordinary Shares, 65,431,579 Series B Preferred Shares and 79,368,421 non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>(iv) </td> <td>Various employees of Sogou and Sohu: 19,490,870 Class A Ordinary Shares. </td> </tr>\n</table> Sohu's Shareholding in and Control of Sogou\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 36% of the outstanding equity capital of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis, assuming for such purpose that all share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised, and that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us. Also as of December 31, 2016, we held over 50% of the total voting power of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis and controlled the election of a majority of the Board of Directors of Sogou, assuming that Tencent's non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares are converted to voting shares, that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us, and that all Sogou share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all Sogou share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised.\nAs Sogou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Sogou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting economic interests in Sogou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cSogou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Sogou's net income/(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Sogou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity/(deficit) and adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders' investments in Sogou's Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares (collectively, the \u201cSogou Preferred Shares\u201d) and Ordinary Shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in our consolidated balance sheets, as we have the right to reject a redemption requested by the noncontrolling shareholders. These treatments are based on the terms governing investment, and on the terms of the classes of Sogou shares held, by the noncontrolling shareholders in Sogou.\nPrinciples of Allocation of Sogou's Profit and Loss\nBy virtue of the terms of Sogou Preferred Shares and Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares, Sogou's losses are allocated in the following order:\n(i) net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and the holder of Sogou Class B Ordinary Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\n(ii) additional net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\n(iii) additional net losses are allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares until its basis in Sogou decreases to zero; and\n(iv) further net losses are allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nNet income from Sogou is allocated in the following order:\n(i) net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou until their basis in Sogou increases to zero;\n(ii) additional net income is allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares to bring its basis back;\n(iii) additional net income is allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares to bring their basis back;\n(iv) further net income is allocated to holders of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and the holder of Sogou Class B Ordinary Shares to bring their basis back; and\n(v) further net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nKey Terms of Sogou Preferred Shares\nThe following is a summary of some of the key terms of the Sogou Preferred Shares under Sogou's Memorandum and Articles of Association as currently in effect.\nDividend Rights\nSogou may not declare or pay dividends on its Class A Ordinary Shares or Class B Ordinary Shares (collectively, \u201cOrdinary Shares\u201d) unless the holders of the Sogou Preferred Shares then outstanding first receive a dividend on each outstanding Preferred Share in an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) the dividends that would have been payable to the holder of such Preferred Share if such share had been converted into Ordinary Shares, at the then-applicable conversion rate, immediately prior to the record date for such dividend, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid Accruing Dividends. \u201cAccruing Dividends\u201d are calculated from the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.0375 per Series A Preferred Share and from the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.411 per Series B Preferred Share.\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of any \u201cLiquidation Event,\u201d such as the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Sogou, a merger or consolidation of Sogou resulting in a change of control, the sale of substantially all of Sogou's assets or similar events, the holders of Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) $6.847 plus any unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable if the Series B Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares prior the Liquidation Event, and holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive, after payment to the holders of the Series B Preferred Shares but before any payment to holders of Ordinary Shares, an amount equal to the greater of (i) 1.3 times their original investment in the Series A Preferred Shares plus all accrued but unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would be payable if the Series A Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Liquidation Event.\nRedemption Rights\nThe Sogou Preferred Shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders.\nConversion Rights\nEach Sogou Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder. Each Sogou Preferred Share is convertible into such number of Class A Ordinary Shares as is determined, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, by dividing $0.625 by the then-effective conversion price for Series A Preferred Shares, which is initially $0.625, and, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, by dividing $7.267 by the then-effective conversion price for Series B Preferred Shares, which is initially $7.267. The conversion prices of the Sogou Preferred Shares are subject to adjustment on a weighted average basis upon the issuance of additional equity shares, or securities convertible into equity shares, at a price per share less than $0.625, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, or less than $7.267, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, subject to certain customary exceptions, such as shares issued pursuant to the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan. Each Sogou Preferred Share will be automatically converted into Class A Ordinary Shares of Sogou upon the closing of a qualified IPO of Sogou based on the then-effective conversion ratio of such Sogou Preferred Share, which is currently one-for-one for both Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of Sogou Preferred Shares is entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of Class A Ordinary Shares into which the Sogou Preferred Shares held by such holder are then convertible.\nOther Rights\nThe holders of Sogou Preferred Shares have various other rights typical of preferred share investments.\nKey Terms of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares\nThe Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares have identical rights, except that Class B Ordinary Shares do not have voting rights unless the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares elect, by written notice to Sogou, to convert them into shares with voting rights.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Changyou\nChangyou is a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 69% of the combined total of Changyou's outstanding ordinary shares, and controlled approximately 96% of the total voting power in Changyou.\nAs Changyou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Changyou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting the economic interest in Changyou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cChangyou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, based on their share of the economic interest in Changyou. Changyou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity, adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and adjustment for changes in our ownership in Changyou, are recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.\nSegment Reporting\nOur Group's segments are business units that offer different services and are reviewed separately by the chief operating decision maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d), or the decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is Sohu.com Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nBarter trade transactions in which physical goods or services (other than advertising services) are received in exchange for advertising services are recorded based on the fair values of the goods and services received. For online advertising-for-online advertising barter transactions, no revenue or expense is recognized because the fair value of neither the advertising surrendered nor the advertising received is determinable.\nOnline Advertising Revenues\nOnline advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services as well as search and search-related services. We recognize revenue for the amount of fees we receive from our advertisers, after deducting agent rebates and net of value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and related surcharges.\nBrand Advertising Revenues\nBusiness Model\nThrough PCs and mobile devices, we provide advertisement placements to our advertisers on different Internet platforms and in different formats, which include banners, links, logos, buttons, full screen, pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll video screens, pause video screens, loading page ads, news feed ads and in-feed video infomercial ads.\nCurrently we have four main types of pricing models, consisting of the Fixed Price model, the Cost Per Impression (\u201cCPM\u201d) model, the E-commerce model, and the Cost Per click (\u201cCPC\u201d) model.\nFixed Price model\nUnder the Fixed Price model, a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided. We recognize revenue based on the contract price and the period of display.\nCPM model\nUnder the CPM model, the unit price for each qualifying display is fixed, but there is no overall fixed price for the advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. A qualifying display is defined as the appearance of an advertisement, where the advertisement meets criteria specified in the contract. We recognize revenue based on the fees we charge the advertisers, which are based on the unit prices and the number of qualifying displays.\nE-commerce model\nUnder the e-commerce model, revenues were mainly generated from sales of membership cards which allow potential home buyers to purchase specified properties from real estate developers at a discount greater than the price that Focus charges for the card. Membership fees are refundable until the potential home buyer uses the discounts to purchase properties. Focus recognizes such revenues upon obtaining confirmation that the membership card has been redeemed to purchase a property.\nCPC model\nUnder the CPC model, there is no overall fixed price for advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. We charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the advertisements. The unit price for each click is auction-based. We recognize revenue based on qualifying clicks and the unit price.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor brand advertising revenue recognition, prior to entering into contracts, we make a credit assessment of the advertiser. For contracts for which collectability is determined to be reasonably assured, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met. In other cases, we only recognize revenue when the cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nWe treat advertising contracts with multiple deliverable elements as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and recognizes revenue on a periodic basis during the contract period when each deliverable service is provided. Since the contract price is for all deliverables under one advertising contract, we allocate the contract price among all the deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No. 2009-13.We first use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price does not exist, we use third-party evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use management's best estimate of selling price for the deliverables.\nSearch and Search-related Revenues\nSearch and search-related services primarily include pay-for-click services, as well as online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou.\nPay-for-click Services\nPay-for-click services are services that enable our advertisers' promotional links to be displayed on Sogou search result pages and Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties where the links are relevant to the subject and content of such properties. For pay-for-click services, we introduce Internet users to our advertisers through our auction-based pay-for-click systems and charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links. Revenue for pay-for-click services is recognized on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links.\nOnline Marketing Services on Web Directories Operated by Sogou\nOnline marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou mainly consist of displaying advertisers' promotional links on the Web pages of Web directories. Revenue for online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou is normally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nBoth pay-for-click services and online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou expand distribution of advertisers' promotional links or advertisements by leveraging traffic on Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties including Web content, software and mobile applications. We recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees we receive from advertisers, as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability. Payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members are included in cost of search and search-related revenues as traffic acquisition costs. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based on either revenue-sharing arrangements, under which we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of their properties, or on a pre-agreed unit price.\nOnline Game Revenues\nChangyou's online game revenues are generated primarily from its self-operated and licensed-out PC games and mobile games. Prior to the sale of the 7Road business in 2015, Changyou generated online game revenues from Web games, which have been an insignificant part of Changyou's business since the sale. Changyou's online game revenues also include a small amount of revenues generated from online card and board games offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser. All of Changyou's games are operated under the item-based revenue model, where the basic game play functions are free of charge and players are charged for purchases of in-game virtual items, including those with a predetermined expiration time and perpetual virtual items.\nSelf-Operated Games\nChangyou is the primary obligor of its self-operated games. Changyou hosts the games on its own servers and is responsible for the sale and marketing of the games as well as customer service. Accordingly, revenues are recorded gross of revenue sharing-payments to third-party developers and/or mobile APP stores, but are net of business tax/VAT and discounts to game card distributors where applicable. Changyou obtains revenues from the sale of in-game virtual items. Revenues are recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased by game players or as the virtual items are consumed. If different assumptions were used in deriving the estimated lives of the virtual items, the timing of the recording of the revenues would be impacted.\nPC Games\nProceeds from the self-operation of PC games are collected from players and third-party game card distributors through sales of Changyou's game points on its online payment platform and prepaid game cards.\nSelf-operated PC games are either developed in house or licensed from third-party developers. For licensed PC games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\nMobile Games\nFor self-operated mobile games, Changyou sells game points to its game players via third-party mobile APP stores. The mobile APP stores in turn pay Changyou proceeds after deducting their share of pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts.\nSelf-operated mobile games are either developed in house or licensed from or jointly developed with third-party developers. For licensed and jointly developed mobile games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to mobile application stores and third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\nWeb Games\nChangyou continued to operate a small portfolio of self-operated Web games after its sale of the 7Road business in 2015. Proceeds from those Web games are collected from players through the sale of game points.\nLicensed-Out Games\nChangyou also authorizes third parties to operate its online games. Licensed out games include PC games and mobile games developed in house and mobile games jointly developed with third-party developers. Changyou receives monthly revenue-based royalty payments from all the third-party licensee operators. Changyou receives additional up-front license fees from certain third-party licensee operators who are entitled to an exclusive right to operate Changyou's games in specified geographic areas. Since Changyou is obligated to provide post-sale services, the initial license fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the license period, and the monthly revenue-based royalty payments are recognized when relevant services are delivered, provided that collectability is reasonably assured. Changyou views the third-party licensee operators as Changyou's customers and recognizes revenues on a net basis, as Changyou does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services. Changyou remits to the third-party developers a pre-agreed percentage of revenues from jointly developed and licensed out mobile games, and recognizes revenues on a net basis.\nOther Revenues\nSohu\nOther revenues attributable to Sohu consist primarily of revenues from paid subscription services, interactive broadcasting services, sub-licensing of purchased video content to third parties, content provided through the platforms of the three main telecommunications operators in China, and the filming business.\nSogou\nOther revenues attributable to Sogou are primarily IVAS revenues derived from the operation of Web games and mobile games of third-party developers as well as other services and products that Sogou provides to users.\nChangyou\nOther revenues attributable to Changyou are primarily from its cinema advertising business and from IVAS.\nIn its cinema advertising business, Changyou provides clients advertising placements in slots that are shown in theaters before the screening of movies. The rights to place advertisements in such advertising slots are granted under contracts Changyou signs with different theaters. When all the recognition criteria are met, revenues from cinema advertising are recognized based on a percentage of the advertising slots actually delivered or on a straight-line basis over the contract period.\nChangyou provides IVAS primarily through software applications for PCs and mobile devices offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser and by RaidCall. Revenues from IVAS are recognized during the period the service rendered or items consumed under the gross method, as Changyou is the principal obligor for provision of the services.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Online Advertising Revenues\nCost of online advertising revenues includes cost of revenues from brand advertising services as well as cost of revenues from search and search-related services.\nCost of Brand Advertising Revenues\nCost of brand advertising revenues mainly consists of content and license costs, bandwidth leasing costs, and salary and benefits expense.\nCost of Search and Search-related Revenues\nCost of search and search-related revenues mainly consists of traffic acquisition costs, bandwidth leasing costs, depreciation expenses, as well as salary and benefits expenses. Traffic acquisition costs represent payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based either on revenue-sharing arrangements or on a pre-agreed unit price. Under the revenue-sharing arrangements, we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of the Website Alliance members' properties.\nCost of Online Game Revenues\nCost of online game revenues mainly consists of revenue-sharing payments, salary and benefits expense, bandwidth leasing costs, content and license costs, amortization and depreciation expenses, and other direct costs.\nCost of Other Revenues\nCost of other revenues mainly consists of payments to theaters and film production companies for pre-film screening advertising slots, content and license costs related to paid subscription services, revenue-sharing payments related to the IVAS business, and revenue-sharing payments related to interactive broadcasting services.\nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses mainly consist of salary and benefits expenses, content and license expenses, technical service fees, depreciation and amortization expenses, share-based compensation, and facilities expenses. These expenses are incurred for the enhancement and maintenance of our Internet platforms as well as for our products and services, including the development costs of online games prior to the establishment of technological feasibility and maintenance costs after the online games are available for marketing.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses mainly consist of advertising and promotional expenses, salary and benefits expenses, travel expenses, and facility expenses. Advertising and promotional expenses generally represent the expenses of promotions to create or stimulate a positive image of us or a desire to subscribe for our products and services. Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses mainly consist of salary and benefits expenses, professional service fees, facility expenses, travel expenses, share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nSohu (excluding Fox Video Limited), Sogou, Changyou, and Fox Video Limited (\u201cSohu Video\u201d) have incentive plans for the granting of share-based awards, including stock options, share options and restricted share units, to members of the boards of directors, management and other key employees.\nFor share-based awards for which a grant date has occurred, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the fair value of the related share-based awards on their grant dates. For share-based awards for which the service inception date precedes the grant date, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning on the service inception date and is re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the related share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is charged to the shareholders' equity or noncontrolling interest section in the consolidated balance sheets. The assumptions used in share-based compensation expense recognition represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change or different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different for any period. Moreover, the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes.\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou, and Changyou Share-based Awards\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video) Share-based Awards\nIn determining the fair value of stock options granted by Sohu (excluding Sohu Video) as share-based awards before 2006, the Black-Scholes valuation model was applied. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates was applied.\nOptions for the purchase of Sohu common stock contractually granted under the Sohu 2010 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Sohu and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair value at the grant date. In determining the fair values of the stock options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nSogou Share-based Awards\nIn determining the fair value of share options granted by Sogou as share-based awards, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. Certain persons who became Sogou employees when Tencent's Soso search-related businesses were transferred to Sogou on September 16, 2013 had been granted restricted share units under Tencent's share award arrangements prior to the transfer of the businesses to Sogou. These Tencent restricted share units will continue to vest under the original Tencent share award arrangements provided the transferred employees continue to be employed by Sogou during the requisite service period. After the transfer of the Soso search-related businesses to Sogou, Sogou applied the guidance in ASC 505-50 to measure the related compensation expense, based on the then-current fair value at each reporting date, as the expense is deemed to have been incurred by Tencent as an investor on Sogou's behalf. To determine the then-current fair value of the Tencent restricted share units granted to these employees, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was applied. Because Sogou is not required to reimburse Tencent for such share-based compensation expense, the related amount was recorded by Sogou as a capital contribution from Tencent.\nChangyou Share-based Awards\nIn determining the fair value of ordinary shares and restricted share units granted by Changyou as share-based awards in 2008, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in 2009 shortly before Changyou's initial public offering, the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on Changyou's offering price for its initial public offering. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after Changyou's initial public offering, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates was applied.\nOptions for the purchase of Changyou Class A ordinary shares contractually granted under the Changyou 2014 Share Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Changyou and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair values at the grant date. In determining the fair values of Changyou share options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nCompensation Expense Recognition\nFor options and restricted share units granted with respect to Sohu (excluding Sohu Video) shares and Changyou shares, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period. For share options granted with respect to Sogou shares, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period during which the service period requirement and performance target will be met. For Tencent restricted share units that Tencent had granted to employees who transferred to Sogou with the Soso search-related businesses, compensation expense is recognized by Sogou on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period, and the fair value of the share-based compensation is re-measured at each reporting date until vesting occurs. The number of share-based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated, and no compensation expense is recorded for the number of awards so estimated.\nSohu Video Share-based Awards\nOn January 4, 2012, Sohu Video, the holding entity of Sohu's video division, adopted a 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the \u201cVideo 2011 Share Incentive Plan\u201d) which provides for the issuance of up to 25,000,000 ordinary shares of Sohu Video (representing approximately 10% of the outstanding Sohu Video shares on a fully-diluted basis) to management and key employees of the video division and to Sohu management. As of December 31, 2016, grants of options for the purchase of 16,368,200 ordinary shares of Sohu Video had been contractually made, of which options for the purchase of 4,972,800 ordinary shares were vested.\nFor purposes of ASC 718-10-25, as of December 31, 2016, no grant date had occurred, because the broader terms and conditions of the option awards had neither been finalized nor mutually agreed upon with the recipients. Therefore the fair value of the awards was not determinable and could not be accounted for. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, our management determined that the service inception date with respect to vested option awards for the purchase of 4,972,800 shares had preceded the grant date. Therefore, we recognized compensation expense for these vested Sohu Video share-based awards and re-measured, and will re-measure, the compensation expense on each subsequent reporting date based on the then-current fair values of these vested awards until the grant date is established.\nTaxation\nIncome Taxes\nRecognition\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future profitability, and tax planning strategies. If events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred. If events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting basis and tax basis for our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs, which are subject to corporate income tax in the PRC under the CIT law.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance, which required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a non-current amount in a classified balance sheet. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Additionally, the new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.\nWe have changed the manner in which we classify our deferred tax assets and liabilities retrospectively from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to our early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. As a result of our adoption of this guidance, we reclassified our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 from current assets and liabilities to long-term assets and liabilities.\nApplicable Income Tax Rate\nPrincipal Entities Qualified as HNTEs\nThe CIT Law generally applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises but grants preferential tax treatment to HNTEs. Under this preferential tax treatment, HNTEs can enjoy an income tax rate of 15%, but need to re-apply every three years. During this three-year period, an HNTE must conduct a qualification self-review each year to ensure it meets the HNTE criteria and is eligible for the 15% preferential tax rate for that year. If an HNTE fails to meet the criteria for qualification as an HNTE in any year, the enterprise cannot enjoy the 15% preferential tax rate in that year, and must instead use the regular 25% CIT rate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the following principal entities were qualified as HNTEs and were entitled to an income tax rate of 15%.\nFor Sohu's Business\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Sohu New Momentum.

An entity that qualifies as a \u201cKey National Software Enterprise\u201d (a \u201cKNSE\u201d) is entitled to a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10%. Enterprises wishing to enjoy the status of a Software Enterprise or KNSE must perform a self-assessment each year to ensure they meet the criteria for qualification and file required supporting documents with the tax authorities before using the preferential CIT rates. These enterprises will be subject to the tax authorities' assessment each year as to whether they are entitled to use the relevant preferential CIT treatments. If at any time during the preferential tax treatment years an enterprise uses the preferential CIT rates but the relevant authorities determine that it fails to meet applicable criteria for qualification, the relevant authorities may revoke the enterprise's Software Enterprise/KNSE status.\nFor Sohu's Business\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Sohu New Momentum.

A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the \u201cAvoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital,\u201d if such holding company is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%.\nPRC Value Added Tax\nEffective September 1, 2012, a pilot program (the \u201cPilot Program\u201d) for transition from the imposition of PRC business tax (\u201cBusiness Tax\u201d) to the imposition of VAT for revenues from certain industries was implemented in certain cities and provinces in China, including Beijing and Tianjin. Prior to the Pilot Program, the Group was mainly subject to a 5% PRC business tax and related surcharges on revenues in the PRC. PRC business tax and the related surcharges were recognized when the revenue was earned.\nOn May 1, 2016, the transition from the imposition of Business Tax to the imposition of VAT was expanded to all industries in China, and all of our revenues have been subject to VAT since that date. To record VAT payable, we adopted the net presentation method, which presents the difference between the output VAT (at a rate of 6%) and the available input VAT amount (at the rate applicable to the supplier).\nU.S. Corporate Income Tax\nSohu.com Inc. is a Delaware corporation that is subject to U.S. corporate income tax on its taxable income at a rate of up to 35%. To the extent that portions of its U.S. taxable income, such as Subpart F income or a dividend, are determined to be from sources outside of the U.S., subject to certain limitations, Sohu.com Inc. may be able to claim foreign tax credits to offset its U.S. income tax liabilities. Any remaining liabilities are accrued in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and estimated tax payments are made when required by U.S. law.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to various taxes in different jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. and the PRC. Management reviews regularly the adequacy of the provisions for taxes as they relate to our income and transactions. In order to assess uncertain tax positions, we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition. For the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement.\nNet Income /(Loss) per Share\nBasic net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with performance requirements is not considered before the performance targets are actually met. The computation of diluted net income / (loss) per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net income / (loss) per share. Additionally, for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income / (loss) per share, the net income / (loss) attributable to the Sohu Group is adjusted as follows. The adjustment will not be made if there is an anti-dilutive effect.\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Sogou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Sogou Preferred Shares and Ordinary Shares, shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if-converted method, and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and is not determined by allocating Sogou's net income /(loss) to Sohu.com Inc. using the methodology for the calculation of net income /(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders. </td> </tr>\n</table> In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income / (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, the percentage of Sohu.com Inc.'s shareholding in Sogou was calculated by treating convertible preferred shares issued by Sogou as having been converted at the beginning of the period and unvested Sogou share options with the performance targets achieved as well as vested but unexercised Sogou share options as having been exercised during the period. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with a performance requirement was not considered before the performance targets were actually met. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Sogou shares and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted income /(loss) per share. As a result, Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Changyou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and not by using the percentage held by Sohu.com Inc. of the total economic interest in Changyou, which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share. </td> </tr>\n</table> In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income/ (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, all of Changyou's existing unvested restricted share units and share options, and vested restricted share units and share options that have not yet been settled, are treated as vested and settled by Changyou under the treasury stock method, causing the percentage of the weighted average number of shares held by Sohu.com Inc. in Changyou to decrease. As a result, Changyou's net income / (loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis decreased accordingly. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Changyou restricted share units and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income /(loss) per share. As a result, Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nOur financial instruments mainly include cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, assets held for sale, prepaid and other current assets, long-term investments (including available-for-sale equity securities), restricted time deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, receipts in advance and deferred revenue, liabilities held for sale, other short-term liabilities and long-term accounts payable.\nCash Equivalents\nOur cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\nShort-term Investments\nFor investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets, we elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments subsequently at fair value. Changes in fair values are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nThe carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. We make estimations of the collectability of accounts receivable. Many factors are considered in estimating the general allowance, including reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, performing an aging analysis and a customer credit analysis, and analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nInvestments in debt securities and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values not classified as trading securities or as held-to-maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, and are included in long-term investments. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income or losses in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the period in which the gain or loss is realized. An impairment loss on the available-for-sale securities is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nRestricted Time Deposits\nRestricted time deposits are valued based on the prevailing interest rates in the market using the discounted cash flow method.\nCollateral related to Sogou Incentive Shares Trust Arrangements\nIn February 2013, we deposited $9.0 million in cash into restricted time deposit accounts at a bank as collateral for credit facilities provided by the bank to certain Sogou employees. The facilities were intended to fund the employees' early exercise of Sogou share options and related PRC individual income tax. In the fourth quarter of 2016, all of these credit facilities were repaid to the bank and the $9.0 million restricted time deposit that secured these facilities was released.\nChangyou Loans from Offshore Banks, Secured by Time Deposits\nCommencing in 2012, we had, through Changyou, loans from offshore banks secured by RMB deposits in onshore branches of those banks. The loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as short-term bank loans or long-term bank loans based on their repayment period. The rates of interest under the loan agreements with the lending banks were determined based on the prevailing interest rates in the market. The RMB onshore deposits securing the offshore loans are treated as restricted time deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2016, Changyou repaid all of the remaining bank loans, and restricted time deposits that secured these loans were released.\nForeign exchange forward contracts\nForeign exchange forward contracts are initially recognized on the date a foreign exchange forward contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Changyou entered into such foreign exchange forward contracts in compliance with its risk management policy for the purpose of eliminating the negative impact on earnings and equity resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. The instruments are marked-to-market at each period-end with the associated changes in fair value recognized in the line item \u201cOther income /(expense), net\u201d in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and \u201cOther short-term liabilities\u201d or \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nEquity Investments\nInvestments in entities are recorded as equity investments under long-term investments. For entities over which we do not have significant influence, the cost method is applied, as there is no readily determinable fair value; for entities over which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or control, the equity method is applied. For cost method investments, we carry the investment at historical cost after the date of investment. For equity method investments, we adjust the carrying amount of an investment and recognize investment income or loss for our share of the earnings or loss of the investee after the date of investment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include fixed assets and intangible assets.\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets mainly comprise office buildings, computer equipment and hardware, leasehold improvements, office furniture, and vehicles. Fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Useful Lives (years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office buildings </td> <td> </td> <td>36-47 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leasehold improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>Lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vehicles </td> <td> </td> <td>4-10 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office furniture </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computer equipment and hardware </td> <td> </td> <td>2-5 </td> </tr>\n</table> Expenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred.\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of fixed assets is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell the relevant assets and is recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets mainly comprise purchased video content, operating rights for licensed games, domain names and trademarks, computer software, developed technologies, and cinema advertising slot rights. Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value. Amortization of intangible assets other than purchased video content is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nThe estimated useful lives of our intangible assets are listed below:\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Useful Lives (years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Domain names and trademarks </td> <td> </td> <td>4-30 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Developed technologies </td> <td> </td> <td>3-10 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computer software </td> <td> </td> <td>1-5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchased video content </td> <td> </td> <td>4 months to 2 years, or over the applicable licensing period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cinema advertising slot rights </td> <td> </td> <td>over the contract terms </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating rights for licensed games </td> <td> </td> <td>over the contract terms </td> </tr>\n</table> Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10-35, we review the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of long-lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management. An impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nVideo Content\nVideo content consists primarily of purchased video content and self-developed video content. Purchased video content is recognized as intangible assets. Amortization of purchased video content is computed based on the trend in viewership accumulation. For self-developed video content, production costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for are expensed as incurred, instead of being recorded as intangible assets.\nSohu Video enters into nonmonetary transactions to exchange online broadcasting rights for purchased video content with other online video broadcasting companies. Under ASC 845, the cost of a nonmonetary asset acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary asset is the fair value of the asset surrendered to obtain the acquired nonmonetary asset, and a gain or loss should be recognized on the exchange. The fair value of the asset received should be used to measure the cost if the fair value of the asset received is more reliable than the fair value of the asset surrendered. We record these nonmonetary exchanges at the fair values of the online broadcasting rights for purchased video content and recognize any net gain or loss from such exchange transactions.\nImpairment of Video Content\nPurchased video content is stated at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value (\u201cNRV\u201d).\nIn accordance with ASC 920-350-35, if management's expectations of the programming usefulness of a program, series, package, or program segment are revised downward, it may be necessary to write down unamortized cost to estimated NRV. A write-down from unamortized cost to a lower estimated NRV establishes a new cost basis. Accordingly, we measure the video content's impairment loss by comparing its carrying value to its NRV. An impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying value of video content was lower than its NRV. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the NRV of video content exceeds its carrying value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, we report in our financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. If a measurement period adjustment is identified, we recognize the adjustment as part of the acquisition accounting. We increase or decrease the provisional amounts of identifiable assets or liabilities by means of increases or decreases in goodwill for measurement period adjustments.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Under ASC 350-20-35, we have the option to choose whether we will apply a qualitative assessment first and then a quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply a quantitative assessment directly. For reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first, we start the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. For reporting units directly applying the quantitative assessment, we perform the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair value, we perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate fair value using the income approach or market approach. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, control premium, comparable companies' multipliers, and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments from owners and distributions to owners. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented on our consolidated balance sheets, includes a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and an unrealized gain/(loss) on available-for-sale securities.\nFunctional Currency and Foreign Currency Translation\nAn entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management's judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency of Sohu.com Inc. is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the U.S., the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries and VIEs in other countries are the national currencies of those counties, rather than the U.S. dollar.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are re-measured at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFinancial statements of entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, which is the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders' equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders' equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the year, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate each period's income statement. Differences resulting from translating a foreign currency to the reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRESULTS OF

and $899.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $71.5 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $217.6 million, representing a year-on-year decrease rate of 6% for 2016 and a year-on-year growth rate of 24% for 2015.\nBrand Advertising Revenues, Generated by Sohu and Changyou\nBrand advertising revenues were $448.0 million for 2016, compared to $577.1 million and $541.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $129.1 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $35.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 22% for 2016 and a year-on-year increase of 7% for 2015. The year-on-year fluctuations in brand advertising revenues for 2016 and 2015 were both mainly from Sohu Video.\nSohu\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Sohu Media Portal </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues from Sohu Media Portal were $181.8 million for 2016, compared to $197.6 million for both 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $15.8 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 8% compared to 2015, while revenues for 2015 were flat compared to 2014. In 2016, while the slowdown in the growth of the economy in China shrank the budgets of brand advertisers, rapid growth in the number of small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers advertising on Sohu Media Portal helped offset the impact to some extent. The number of advertisers for Sohu Media Portal was 4,259 for 2016, compared to 3,471 and 2,673, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $43,000 for 2016, compared to $57,000 and $74,000, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Sohu Video </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues from Sohu Video were $123.1 million for 2016, compared to $212.8 million and $175.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 decreased by $89.7 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 42% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 increased by $37.0 million, representing year-on-year growth of 21% compared to 2014. The changes were mainly attributable to fluctuations both in the number of advertisers and in the average amount spent per advertiser. The number of advertisers on Sohu Video was 455, 587 and 596, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $271,000, $363,000 and $295,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Focus </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues from Focus were $103.7 million for 2016, compared to $109.6 million and $108.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The revenues for 2016 decreased by $5.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 were generally stable compared to 2014.\nRevenues from Focus were generated through the Fixed Price model and the E-commerce model.\nFor the Fixed Price model, revenues were $49.0 million for 2016, compared to $55.4 million and $67.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $6.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a decrease of 12% and 18%, respectively. In the currently soft Chinese macro economy, advertisers from the real estate business are less willing to adopt the Fixed Price model, which caused our revenues from this model to decrease.\nFor the E-commerce model, revenues were $54.7 million for 2016, compared to $54.2 million and $41.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 were flat compared to 2015, while year-on-year growth from 2014 to 2015 was 32%. The number of developers with which we had cooperation arrangements was 1,490, 1,015 and 808, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The number of paying subscribers for the membership services was 95,613, 94,149 and 73,232, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nChangyou\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>17173.com Website </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues from the 17173.com Website were $39.4 million for 2016, compared to $57.1 million and $59.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $17.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. The decreases were primarily a result of fewer PC games being marketed on the 17173.com Website. The number of advertisers on the 17173.com Website was 193, 194 and 168, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $204,000, $294,000 and $351,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOther information\nSales to our five largest advertisers comprised approximately 11% of total brand advertising revenues for 2016, compared to 10% and 8%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $12.3 million, $21.4 million and $24.5 million, respectively, of receipts in advance from advertisers. As of December 31, 2016, we had obligations to provide, and advertisers had obligations to purchase, advertising services under existing contracts in the amount of $10.1 million, which are required to be provided during the year ending December 31, 2017.\nSearch and Search-related Revenues, Generated by Sogou\nRevenues from search and search-related services were $597.1 million for 2016, compared to $539.5 million and $357.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 11% and 51%, respectively, for 2016 and 2015.\nThe increase in revenues from search and search-related services was mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from pay-for-click services.\nRevenues from pay-for-click services accounted for approximately 82% of the total search and search-related revenues for 2016, compared to 82% and 80%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The growth in revenues from pay-for-click services was principally attributable to an increase in the number of paid clicks, offset by depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Paid clicks increased by approximately 21% and 39%, respectively, driven by growth in mobile search traffic, for 2016 and 2015, compared to the prior year.\nOnline Game Revenues Generated by Changyou\nRevenues from the online game business were $395.7 million for 2016, compared to $636.8 million and $652.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of Changyou's older games, and a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015.\nPC games and Mobile Games\nRevenues from PC games were $274.6 million for 2016, compared to $387.6 million and $485.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing 69%, 61% and 74%, respectively, of Changyou's online game revenues for the corresponding years. The dominant PC game operated by Changyou is TLBB. The year-on-year decreases in PC game revenues were $113.0 million and $97.5 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a year-on-year decrease of 29% and 20%. The year-on-year decrease in revenues from PC games was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB, which is an older PC game. In 2016, the PC game TLBB generated $219.7 million in revenues, accounting for approximately 56% of Changyou's online game revenues, approximately 42% of Changyou's total revenues and approximately 13% of the Sohu Group's total revenues.\nRevenues from mobile games were $116.8 million for 2016, compared to $203.3 million and $66.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The dominant mobile game operated by Changyou was TLBB 3D. The year-on-year decrease in mobile game revenues for 2016 was $86.5 million, mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB 3D, which is an older mobile game. The year-on-year increase in mobile game revenues for 2015 was $137.1 million, mainly due to revenues from Changyou's primary mobile game TLBB 3D, which was launched in October, 2014.\nThe following

The decrease mainly consisted of a $23.7 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, which primarily resulted from a reduction in Changyou's workforce, a $12.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, and a $3.1 million decrease in travelling and entertainment expenses, offset by a $3.5 million increase in facility expenses, a $2.5 million increase in professional service fees, and a $2.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nGoodwill Impairment and Impairment of Intangibles Acquired as Part of Business Acquisition\nIn 2016, there was no goodwill impairment or impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses.\nIn 2015, we recognized $40.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisition. This $40.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $29.6 million goodwill impairment loss and a $8.9 million intangible assets impairment loss related to MoboTap. As the financial performance of the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap was below original expectations, Changyou's management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou's platform channel business.\nIn 2014, we recognized $52.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisitions. This $52.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for intangible assets related to RaidCall, which was acquired by Changyou in 2013, as Changyou management determined that RaidCall's audio communication technology was not a good fit for Changyou's online games business.\nShare-based Compensation

2014.\nOther (Expense)/Income\nOther expense was $10.7 million for 2016, compared to other income of $74.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The changes were mainly due to a disposal gain of $55.1 million recognized by Changyou for its sale of the 7Road business and certain Changyou subsidiaries during the third quarter of 2015, and a $27.8 million one-time expense recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to a donation by Sogou to Tsinghua University related to setting up a joint research institute focusing on artificial intelligence technology.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $22.5 million for 2016, compared to $30.6 million and $37.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $1.4 million for 2016, compared to $7.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of bank loans. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of our bank loans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $21.1 million for 2016, compared to $76.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease mainly resulted from a reversal of PRC income tax expenses of $10.6 million and $6.4 million by Changyou and Sogou, respectively, for the preferential tax rate that Changyou's and Sogou's subsidiaries received in 2016 as KNSEs or Software Enterprises for 2015, as well as a reversal by Sohu of U.S. income tax expense of $5.0 million for the disposal of an equity investment that occurred in 2015 and was determined in 2016 to be nontaxable. The decrease was also attributable to a decline in profit before tax of our tax-paying entities.\nNet (Loss) / Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $115.0 million for 2016, compared to net income of $108.9 million and a net loss of $171.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nOur net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $109.0 million for 2016, compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $146.5 million for 2015, and a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $32.3 million for 2014.\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders was nil for 2016, compared to $11.9 million and $27.7 million, for 2015 and 2014.\nThe $11.9 million deemed dividend for 2015 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 6.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from noncontrolling shareholders in September 2015. The deemed dividend was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu.com Inc., as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, representing a portion of the differences between the prices Sogou paid to Photon for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amounts of these Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe $27.7 million deemed dividend for 2014 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 14.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from China Web, and was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu, as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, in an amount equal to the proportionate difference between the price Sogou paid to China Web for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amount of these 14.4 million Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Loss attributable to Sohu.com Inc.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $224.0 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc. for 2016, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million and $166.7 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc., respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2016.

and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows generated from our operations. Cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Short-term investments comprise investment instruments issued by commercial banks in China, with a variable interest rate indexed to performance of underlying assets and maturity dates within one year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.05 billion, and short-term investments of $247.9 million. Of our cash and cash equivalents, $393.9 million was held in financial institutions inside Mainland China and $657.1 million was held in financial institutions outside of Mainland China. Our VIEs held $94.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and $956.1 million was held outside of our VIEs.\nWe believe our current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs (net cash used in operating activities), commitments, capital expenditures, and investment activities over the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions and other future developments, or changes in general economic conditions.\nSee Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to China's Regulation Environment - Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our revenues effectively,\u201d \u201c-Our offshore entities may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by the China-based subsidiaries of our subsidiaries Sohu.com Limited, Sogou and Changyou to fund any cash requirements those offshore entities may have. Our offshore entities may not be able to obtain cash from distributions because our subsidiaries and VIEs in China are subject to restrictions imposed by PRC law, and may be subject to future debt covenant restrictions, on paying such dividends or making other payments,\u201d and \u201c- Dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC are subject to PRC profit appropriation and PRC withholding tax,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure - Although the Sohu Group holds substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents is held by Changyou and Sogou, and it can be difficult for Sohu to have access to the portion held by Changyou and Sogou.

Equivalents\nSohu.com Inc. is a Delaware corporation that is subject to U.S. corporate income tax on its taxable income at a rate of up to 35%. To the extent that portions of its U.S. taxable income, such as Subpart F income or a dividend, are determined to be from sources outside of the U.S., subject to certain limitations, Sohu.com Inc. may be able to claim foreign tax credits to offset its U.S. income tax liabilities. Any remaining liabilities are accrued in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and estimated tax payments are made when required by U.S. law.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Changyou\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance, which required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a non-current amount in a classified balance sheet. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Additionally, the new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.\n Note (3): Includes the unrecognized compensation expense for employees who transferred from Tencent with Soso search-related businesses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues by source and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nCost of Revenues\nIn the event of any \u201cLiquidation Event,\u201d such as the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Sogou, a merger or consolidation of Sogou resulting in a change of control, the sale of substantially all of Sogou's assets or similar events, the holders of Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) $6.847 plus any unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable if the Series B Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares prior the Liquidation Event, and holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive, after payment to the holders of the Series B Preferred Shares but before any payment to holders of Ordinary Shares, an amount equal to the greater of (i) 1.3 times their original investment in the Series A Preferred Shares plus all accrued but unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would be payable if the Series A Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Liquidation Event.\nVIE Consolidation\nThe CIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax on dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises in the PRC to their immediate holding companies outside Mainland China. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the \u201cAvoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital,\u201d if such holding company is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%.\nCost of Online Game Revenues\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $142.6 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 27%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $113.1 million decrease in advertising and promotional expenditures, which was mainly due to Changyou's reduction in marketing and promotional spending for Changyou's platform channel business, a $18.1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, and a $5.6 million decrease in facility expenses.\nWeb Games\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Under ASC 350-20-35, we have the option to choose whether we will apply a qualitative assessment first and then a quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply a quantitative assessment directly. For reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first, we start the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. For reporting units directly applying the quantitative assessment, we perform the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair value, we perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nNet Loss attributable to Sohu.com Inc.\n Share-based compensation expense recognized for share awards of Sohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou, Changyou and Sohu Video was as follows (in thousands):\nLong-lived assets include fixed assets and intangible assets.\nFor purposes of ASC 718-10-25, as of December 31, 2016, no grant date had occurred, because the broader terms and conditions of the option awards had neither been finalized nor mutually agreed upon with the recipients. Therefore the fair value of the awards was not determinable and could not be accounted for. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, our management determined that the service inception date with respect to vested option awards for the purchase of 4,972,800 shares had preceded the grant date. Therefore, we recognized compensation expense for these vested Sohu Video share-based awards and re-measured, and will re-measure, the compensation expense on each subsequent reporting date based on the then-current fair values of these vested awards until the grant date is established.\n Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nPay-for-click Services\nRevenues from mobile games were $116.8 million for 2016, compared to $203.3 million and $66.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The dominant mobile game operated by Changyou was TLBB 3D. The year-on-year decrease in mobile game revenues for 2016 was $86.5 million, mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB 3D, which is an older mobile game. The year-on-year increase in mobile game revenues for 2015 was $137.1 million, mainly due to revenues from Changyou's primary mobile game TLBB 3D, which was launched in October, 2014.\nCost of other revenues was $102.4 million for 2016, compared to $80.6 million and $71.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase for 2016 was $21.8 million compared to 2015, which was mainly due to a $16.7 million increase in cinema advertising cost. The year-on-year increase for 2015 was $9.1 million compared to 2014, which was mainly due to $5.7 million in film production costs for \u201cJian Bing Man\u201d that were recognized in 2015.\nOther information\nOther Rights\nOn May 1, 2016, the transition from the imposition of Business Tax to the imposition of VAT was expanded to all industries in China, and all of our revenues have been subject to VAT since that date. To record VAT payable, we adopted the net presentation method, which presents the difference between the output VAT (at a rate of 6%) and the available input VAT amount (at the rate applicable to the supplier).\nThe year-on-year increase for 2015 was $75.5 million, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 25%. This increase mainly consisted of a $56.7 million increase in content and license costs, a $8.9 million increase in salary and benefits expenses and a $3.3 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs.\nOnline Game Revenues\n \u2022 AmazGame. AmazGame qualified as a KNSE and enjoyed a preferential income tax rate of 10% for each of 2013 and 2014. AmazGame performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for KNSE status for 2015. AmazGame was qualified as a KNSE after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 10% for 2015. As a result, a reversal of income tax of $10.6 million for the preferential income tax rate was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Same process will be followed in 2017 by AmazGame for its preferential income tax treatment as a KNSE for 2016. \nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future profitability, and tax planning strategies. If events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred. If events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nSohu (excluding Fox Video Limited), Sogou, Changyou, and Fox Video Limited (\u201cSohu Video\u201d) have incentive plans for the granting of share-based awards, including stock options, share options and restricted share units, to members of the boards of directors, management and other key employees.\nLevel 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n \u2022 Sohu New Momentum. In 2016, Sohu New Momentum was in the first of three years in which it is entitled to a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% as a Software Enterprise, subject to a requirement that it file documents in 2017 in order for the qualification to apply to 2016 and the following two years.  For Sogou's Business\nCost of Search and Search-related Revenues\nGeneral and administrative expenses mainly consist of salary and benefits expenses, professional service fees, facility expenses, travel expenses, share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders\nOur search and search-related gross margin was 51% for 2016, compared to 56% and 54%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in our search and search-related gross margin for 2016 was mainly due to higher traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of search and search-related revenues.\nOur cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $119.8 million for 2016, compared to $173.2 million and $204.3 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nE-commerce model\nCosts and Expenses\nOptions for the purchase of Changyou Class A ordinary shares contractually granted under the Changyou 2014 Share Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Changyou and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair values at the grant date. In determining the fair values of Changyou share options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nProceeds from the self-operation of PC games are collected from players and third-party game card distributors through sales of Changyou's game points on its online payment platform and prepaid game cards.\nOn January 4, 2012, Sohu Video, the holding entity of Sohu's video division, adopted a 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the \u201cVideo 2011 Share Incentive Plan\u201d) which provides for the issuance of up to 25,000,000 ordinary shares of Sohu Video (representing approximately 10% of the outstanding Sohu Video shares on a fully-diluted basis) to management and key employees of the video division and to Sohu management. As of December 31, 2016, grants of options for the purchase of 16,368,200 ordinary shares of Sohu Video had been contractually made, of which options for the purchase of 4,972,800 ordinary shares were vested.\nFor options and restricted share units granted with respect to Sohu (excluding Sohu Video) shares and Changyou shares, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period. For share options granted with respect to Sogou shares, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period during which the service period requirement and performance target will be met. For Tencent restricted share units that Tencent had granted to employees who transferred to Sogou with the Soso search-related businesses, compensation expense is recognized by Sogou on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period, and the fair value of the share-based compensation is re-measured at each reporting date until vesting occurs. The number of share-based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated, and no compensation expense is recorded for the number of awards so estimated.\nOur financial instruments mainly include cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, assets held for sale, prepaid and other current assets, long-term investments (including available-for-sale equity securities), restricted time deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, receipts in advance and deferred revenue, liabilities held for sale, other short-term liabilities and long-term accounts payable.\nCost of brand advertising revenues mainly consists of content and license costs, bandwidth leasing costs, and salary and benefits expense.\nVoting Rights\n \u2022 Sogou Information. Sogou Information qualified as an HNTE for 2015 to 2017, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2018. \nThrough PCs and mobile devices, we provide advertisement placements to our advertisers on different Internet platforms and in different formats, which include banners, links, logos, buttons, full screen, pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll video screens, pause video screens, loading page ads, news feed ads and in-feed video infomercial ads.\nFor self-operated mobile games, Changyou sells game points to its game players via third-party mobile APP stores. The mobile APP stores in turn pay Changyou proceeds after deducting their share of pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts.\nShort-term Investments\nOther Revenues\n Expenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred.\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments from owners and distributions to owners. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented on our consolidated balance sheets, includes a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and an unrealized gain/(loss) on available-for-sale securities.\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nSearch and search-related services primarily include pay-for-click services, as well as online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou.\nSohu Video Share-based Awards\nInterest income was $22.5 million for 2016, compared to $30.6 million and $37.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $45.0 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 11%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $25.6 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $10.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $7.8 million decrease in impairment provision for operating rights for licensed games with technological feasibility, and a $5.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $4.8 million increase in technical service fees.\nFor the E-commerce model, revenues were $54.7 million for 2016, compared to $54.2 million and $41.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 were flat compared to 2015, while year-on-year growth from 2014 to 2015 was 32%. The number of developers with which we had cooperation arrangements was 1,490, 1,015 and 808, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The number of paying subscribers for the membership services was 95,613, 94,149 and 73,232, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nSelf-Operated Games\nSegment Reporting\nBrand Advertising Revenues, Generated by Sohu and Changyou\nIntangible assets mainly comprise purchased video content, operating rights for licensed games, domain names and trademarks, computer software, developed technologies, and cinema advertising slot rights. Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value. Amortization of intangible assets other than purchased video content is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nPurchased video content is stated at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value (\u201cNRV\u201d).\nThe year-on-year decrease in cost of online game revenues for 2016 was $60.1 million. The decrease included a $35.4 million decrease in revenue-sharing payments to mobile APP stores, a $6.4 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $3.4 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $2.4 million decrease in content and license costs, and a $2.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nSelf-operated mobile games are either developed in house or licensed from or jointly developed with third-party developers. For licensed and jointly developed mobile games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to mobile application stores and third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\nThe holders of Sogou Preferred Shares have various other rights typical of preferred share investments.\nResources Analysis\nOur deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting basis and tax basis for our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs, which are subject to corporate income tax in the PRC under the CIT law.\n (1) Average Monthly Active Accounts for a given period refers to the number of registered accounts that were logged in to these games at least once during the period. \n \u2022 Focus  Revenues from Focus were $103.7 million for 2016, compared to $109.6 million and $108.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The revenues for 2016 decreased by $5.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 were generally stable compared to 2014.\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $31.2 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 15%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $23.7 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, which primarily resulted from a reduction in Changyou's workforce, a $12.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, and a $3.1 million decrease in travelling and entertainment expenses, offset by a $3.5 million increase in facility expenses, a $2.5 million increase in professional service fees, and a $2.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nUnder the Fixed Price model, a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided. We recognize revenue based on the contract price and the period of display.\nShare-based compensation expense was recognized in costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, as follows (in thousands):\n (i) Sohu.com Inc.: 131,697,750 Class A Ordinary Shares, of which 4,484,500 shares may be purchased by Sohu management and key employees under an option arrangement; \nFactors and Trends Affecting our Business\nNet income from Sogou is allocated in the following order:\nPC Games\nIn determining the fair value of ordinary shares and restricted share units granted by Changyou as share-based awards in 2008, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in 2009 shortly before Changyou's initial public offering, the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on Changyou's offering price for its initial public offering. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after Changyou's initial public offering, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates was applied.\nUnder the CPM model, the unit price for each qualifying display is fixed, but there is no overall fixed price for the advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. A qualifying display is defined as the appearance of an advertisement, where the advertisement meets criteria specified in the contract. We recognize revenue based on the fees we charge the advertisers, which are based on the unit prices and the number of qualifying displays.\nBrand Advertising Revenues\nPrinciples of Allocation of Sogou's Profit and Loss\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nIn accordance with ASC 920-350-35, if management's expectations of the programming usefulness of a program, series, package, or program segment are revised downward, it may be necessary to write down unamortized cost to estimated NRV. A write-down from unamortized cost to a lower estimated NRV establishes a new cost basis. Accordingly, we measure the video content's impairment loss by comparing its carrying value to its NRV. An impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying value of video content was lower than its NRV. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the NRV of video content exceeds its carrying value.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTaxation\nThe year-on-year increase for 2016 was $51.3 million, representing year-on-year growth of 21%. The increase mainly consisted of a $40.8 million increase in traffic acquisition costs and a $7.0 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs.\nChangyou continued to operate a small portfolio of self-operated Web games after its sale of the 7Road business in 2015. Proceeds from those Web games are collected from players through the sale of game points.\n (iii) Tencent: 6,757,875 Class A Ordinary Shares, 65,431,579 Series B Preferred Shares and 79,368,421 non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares; and \nWeb Games\nOur brand advertising gross margin was 17% for 2016, compared to 34% and 43%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-over-year decrease in our brand advertising gross margin for 2016 was mainly attributable to a decrease in advertising revenues and an increase in video content cost.\n \u2022 Sohu New Momentum. Sohu New Momentum qualified as an HNTE for 2016 to 2018, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2019. \nIn 2016, there was no goodwill impairment or impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are re-measured at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nNet Income /(Loss) per Share\nImpairment of Video Content\nBusiness Model\nGoodwill\nOVERVIEW\nIn February 2013, we deposited $9.0 million in cash into restricted time deposit accounts at a bank as collateral for credit facilities provided by the bank to certain Sogou employees. The facilities were intended to fund the employees' early exercise of Sogou share options and related PRC individual income tax. In the fourth quarter of 2016, all of these credit facilities were repaid to the bank and the $9.0 million restricted time deposit that secured these facilities was released.\nCPM model\nThere was no capitalized share-based compensation expense for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nThe following table presents our operating expenses by nature and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nRevenues from the online game business were $395.7 million for 2016, compared to $636.8 million and $652.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of Changyou's older games, and a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015.\nBarter trade transactions in which physical goods or services (other than advertising services) are received in exchange for advertising services are recorded based on the fair values of the goods and services received. For online advertising-for-online advertising barter transactions, no revenue or expense is recognized because the fair value of neither the advertising surrendered nor the advertising received is determinable.\nPC games and Mobile Games\nSogou may not declare or pay dividends on its Class A Ordinary Shares or Class B Ordinary Shares (collectively, \u201cOrdinary Shares\u201d) unless the holders of the Sogou Preferred Shares then outstanding first receive a dividend on each outstanding Preferred Share in an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) the dividends that would have been payable to the holder of such Preferred Share if such share had been converted into Ordinary Shares, at the then-applicable conversion rate, immediately prior to the record date for such dividend, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid Accruing Dividends. \u201cAccruing Dividends\u201d are calculated from the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.0375 per Series A Preferred Share and from the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.411 per Series B Preferred Share.\nFor Sohu's Business\nProduct development expenses were $353.1 million for 2016, compared to $398.1 million and $409.3 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 17173.com Website  Revenues from the 17173.com Website were $39.4 million for 2016, compared to $57.1 million and $59.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $17.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. The decreases were primarily a result of fewer PC games being marketed on the 17173.com Website. The number of advertisers on the 17173.com Website was 193, 194 and 168, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $204,000, $294,000 and $351,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nSearch and Search-related Revenues, Generated by Sogou\nCost of Online Advertising Revenues\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data for Changyou's PC games and mobile games for the periods indicated:\nRestricted time deposits are valued based on the prevailing interest rates in the market using the discounted cash flow method.\nOptions for the purchase of Sohu common stock contractually granted under the Sohu 2010 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Sohu and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair value at the grant date. In determining the fair values of the stock options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nNet (Loss) / Income\nRevenues from PC games were $274.6 million for 2016, compared to $387.6 million and $485.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing 69%, 61% and 74%, respectively, of Changyou's online game revenues for the corresponding years. The dominant PC game operated by Changyou is TLBB. The year-on-year decreases in PC game revenues were $113.0 million and $97.5 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a year-on-year decrease of 29% and 20%. The year-on-year decrease in revenues from PC games was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB, which is an older PC game. In 2016, the PC game TLBB generated $219.7 million in revenues, accounting for approximately 56% of Changyou's online game revenues, approximately 42% of Changyou's total revenues and approximately 13% of the Sohu Group's total revenues.\nOnline marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou mainly consist of displaying advertisers' promotional links on the Web pages of Web directories. Revenue for online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou is normally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Sogou\nWe have changed the manner in which we classify our deferred tax assets and liabilities retrospectively from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to our early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. As a result of our adoption of this guidance, we reclassified our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 from current assets and liabilities to long-term assets and liabilities.\nFixed Assets\nCost of brand advertising revenues was $371.1 million for 2016, compared to $383.2 million and $307.7 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows generated from our operations. Cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Short-term investments comprise investment instruments issued by commercial banks in China, with a variable interest rate indexed to performance of underlying assets and maturity dates within one year.\nChangyou is a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 69% of the combined total of Changyou's outstanding ordinary shares, and controlled approximately 96% of the total voting power in Changyou.\nChangyou also authorizes third parties to operate its online games. Licensed out games include PC games and mobile games developed in house and mobile games jointly developed with third-party developers. Changyou receives monthly revenue-based royalty payments from all the third-party licensee operators. Changyou receives additional up-front license fees from certain third-party licensee operators who are entitled to an exclusive right to operate Changyou's games in specified geographic areas. Since Changyou is obligated to provide post-sale services, the initial license fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the license period, and the monthly revenue-based royalty payments are recognized when relevant services are delivered, provided that collectability is reasonably assured. Changyou views the third-party licensee operators as Changyou's customers and recognizes revenues on a net basis, as Changyou does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services. Changyou remits to the third-party developers a pre-agreed percentage of revenues from jointly developed and licensed out mobile games, and recognizes revenues on a net basis.\nPrincipal Entities Qualified as HNTEs\n\nChangyou\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $11.1 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 3%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $6.8 million decrease in content and license expense, a $6.8 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $5.6 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $2.9 million decrease in facility expenses, and a $0.7 million decrease in travelling and entertainment expenses, offset by a $8.4 million increase in impairment charges related to game copyrights of Changyou recognized in 2015 and a $3.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nOnline video services remained one of the most popular Internet applications, and continued to gain viewers from television stations. The video industry continued to be deeply competitive as major online platforms aggressively competed for popular content. The competition led to an escalation in the price of content. During 2016, Sohu Video began to shift our focus to the self-developed content category, which, in our view, will create long-lasting value to our platform and offer better financial returns compared to TV station content. Leveraging our exclusive original content, we also actively explored opportunities with subscription services that we believe will become an important revenue source in addition to traditional advertising revenues. Financially, Sohu Video's revenues for 2016 were affected by the weak economy and a turnover of the video sales team in the middle of the year, and its loss-making widened from 2015.\n \u2022 AmazGame and Gamease. AmazGame and Gamease each qualified as HNTEs for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017. \n \u2022 Sohu Era, Sohu Media and Guangzhou Qianjun. Sohu Era, Sohu Media and Guangzhou Qianjun each qualified as HNTEs for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017.  For Sogou's Business\nFor Changyou's Business\nRevenues from Web games were $4.3 million for 2016, compared to $45.9 million and $100.7 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues from Web games decreased $41.6 million and $54.8 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. The decrease in Web games revenues was mainly due to a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015.\nLicensed-Out Games\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is:\nLevel 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place.\n \u2022 Sohu Internet. Sohu Internet qualified as an HNTE for 2015 to 2017, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2018. \nSales and marketing expenses mainly consist of advertising and promotional expenses, salary and benefits expenses, travel expenses, and facility expenses. Advertising and promotional expenses generally represent the expenses of promotions to create or stimulate a positive image of us or a desire to subscribe for our products and services. Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred.\nOur net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $109.0 million for 2016, compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $146.5 million for 2015, and a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $32.3 million for 2014.\n (iv) Various employees of Sogou and Sohu: 19,490,870 Class A Ordinary Shares.  Sohu's Shareholding in and Control of Sogou\nOnline advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services as well as search and search-related services. We recognize revenue for the amount of fees we receive from our advertisers, after deducting agent rebates and net of value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and related surcharges.\nApplicable Income Tax Rate\nCost of Other Revenues\nThe estimated useful lives of our intangible assets are listed below:\n(iii) additional net income is allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares to bring their basis back;\nCost of Brand Advertising Revenues\nThe CIT Law generally applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises but grants preferential tax treatment to HNTEs. Under this preferential tax treatment, HNTEs can enjoy an income tax rate of 15%, but need to re-apply every three years. During this three-year period, an HNTE must conduct a qualification self-review each year to ensure it meets the HNTE criteria and is eligible for the 15% preferential tax rate for that year. If an HNTE fails to meet the criteria for qualification as an HNTE in any year, the enterprise cannot enjoy the 15% preferential tax rate in that year, and must instead use the regular 25% CIT rate.\nThe Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares have identical rights, except that Class B Ordinary Shares do not have voting rights unless the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares elect, by written notice to Sogou, to convert them into shares with voting rights.\nFor a discussion of changes in the basis of presentation for the periods presented below, see Item 7 \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe $27.7 million deemed dividend for 2014 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 14.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from China Web, and was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu, as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, in an amount equal to the proportionate difference between the price Sogou paid to China Web for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amount of these 14.4 million Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nSales to our five largest advertisers comprised approximately 11% of total brand advertising revenues for 2016, compared to 10% and 8%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $12.3 million, $21.4 million and $24.5 million, respectively, of receipts in advance from advertisers. As of December 31, 2016, we had obligations to provide, and advertisers had obligations to purchase, advertising services under existing contracts in the amount of $10.1 million, which are required to be provided during the year ending December 31, 2017.\nRevenues from Focus were generated through the Fixed Price model and the E-commerce model.\n (ii) Photon Group Limited, an investment vehicle of the Sohu Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Zhang (\u201cPhoton\u201d): 32,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares; \nOperating (Loss) / Profit\nVideo content consists primarily of purchased video content and self-developed video content. Purchased video content is recognized as intangible assets. Amortization of purchased video content is computed based on the trend in viewership accumulation. For self-developed video content, production costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for are expensed as incurred, instead of being recorded as intangible assets.\nFor the Fixed Price model, revenues were $49.0 million for 2016, compared to $55.4 million and $67.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $6.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a decrease of 12% and 18%, respectively. In the currently soft Chinese macro economy, advertisers from the real estate business are less willing to adopt the Fixed Price model, which caused our revenues from this model to decrease.\n \u2022 Sogou Network. Sogou Network qualified as an HNTE for 2016 to 2018, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2019. \n \u2022 Sogou Network. Sogou Network performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for Software Enterprise status for 2015. Sogou Network was qualified as a Software Enterprise after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 12.5% for 2015. \nFor Sohu Media Portal, we concentrated our focus on content and product design to accelerate the usage of our core mobile products - the Sohu News APP and the Web-based HTML5 Portal m.sohu.com. During 2016, we continued to optimize Sohu News App's design and introduce new features to meet users' appetites. At the same time, we ramped up marketing and promotion activities to accelerate the product's penetration. Daily active users of Sohu News APP continued to gain traction. On the sales front, in 2016 we experienced a modest decline in revenue for Sohu Media Portal as advertising revenues from large brand advertisers were soft due to the sluggish Chinese economy, while solid growth from small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers partially offset the negative impact.\nThe $11.9 million deemed dividend for 2015 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 6.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from noncontrolling shareholders in September 2015. The deemed dividend was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu.com Inc., as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, representing a portion of the differences between the prices Sogou paid to Photon for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amounts of these Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues from pay-for-click services accounted for approximately 82% of the total search and search-related revenues for 2016, compared to 82% and 80%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The growth in revenues from pay-for-click services was principally attributable to an increase in the number of paid clicks, offset by depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Paid clicks increased by approximately 21% and 39%, respectively, driven by growth in mobile search traffic, for 2016 and 2015, compared to the prior year.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThrough the operation of Sohu, Sogou and Changyou, we generate online advertising revenues (including brand advertising revenues and search and search-related revenues), online games revenues and other revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total revenues were approximately $1.65 billion, representing an decrease of 15% compared to 2015, and our gross margin decreased from 56% to 48%. Our online advertising business generated revenues of $1.05 billion, with a 6% annual decline, representing 63% of total revenues. Our online game business generated revenues of $395.7 million, with a 38% annual decline, representing 24% of total revenues. In 2016, our net loss before deducting the noncontrolling interest was $119.3 million, compared to net profit of $108.9 million in 2015. In 2016, our net loss after deducting the noncontrolling interest was $224.0 million, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million in 2015. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. was $5.83 in 2016, compared to a diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. of $1.32 in 2015.\nCurrently we have four main types of pricing models, consisting of the Fixed Price model, the Cost Per Impression (\u201cCPM\u201d) model, the E-commerce model, and the Cost Per click (\u201cCPC\u201d) model.\nRevenues from search and search-related services were $597.1 million for 2016, compared to $539.5 million and $357.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 11% and 51%, respectively, for 2016 and 2015.\nRevenues\nInterest expense was $1.4 million for 2016, compared to $7.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of bank loans. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of our bank loans.\nCost of online advertising revenues was $661.2 million for 2016, compared to $622.1 million and $471.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase for 2016 and 2015 was $39.1 million and $150.5 million, respectively, representing year-on-year growth of 6% and 32%.\nCost of search and search-related revenues was $290.2 million for 2016, compared to $238.9 million and $163.9 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nInterest Income\nEach holder of Sogou Preferred Shares is entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of Class A Ordinary Shares into which the Sogou Preferred Shares held by such holder are then convertible.\nSogou's Share Structure\nOur Group's segments are business units that offer different services and are reviewed separately by the chief operating decision maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d), or the decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is Sohu.com Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer.\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate fair value using the income approach or market approach. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, control premium, comparable companies' multipliers, and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Identified below are the accounting policies that reflect our most significant estimates and judgments, and those that we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements.\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video) Share-based Awards\nCost of search and search-related revenues mainly consists of traffic acquisition costs, bandwidth leasing costs, depreciation expenses, as well as salary and benefits expenses. Traffic acquisition costs represent payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based either on revenue-sharing arrangements or on a pre-agreed unit price. Under the revenue-sharing arrangements, we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of the Website Alliance members' properties.\nProduct Development Expenses\nSelf-operated PC games are either developed in house or licensed from third-party developers. For licensed PC games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\n(i) net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and the holder of Sogou Class B Ordinary Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\nOur VIEs are wholly or partially owned by certain of our employees as nominee shareholders. For our consolidated VIEs, management made evaluations of the relationships between us and our VIEs and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of such contractual arrangements, we control the shareholders' voting interests in these VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of our consolidated VIEs.\nCost of Other Revenues\nSogou Share-based Awards\nFor Changyou's Business\nOther revenues attributable to Sohu consist primarily of revenues from paid subscription services, interactive broadcasting services, sub-licensing of purchased video content to third parties, content provided through the platforms of the three main telecommunications operators in China, and the filming business.\nNoncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity of subsidiaries and VIEs which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the controlling shareholder. Currently, the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of noncontrolling interests for Sogou and Changyou.\nOur online game gross margin was 76%, 75% and 78%, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. Gross margin for 2016 was stable compared to 2015, while it decreased by 3% from 2014 to 2015.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOnline Game Revenues Generated by Changyou\nPay-for-click services are services that enable our advertisers' promotional links to be displayed on Sogou search result pages and Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties where the links are relevant to the subject and content of such properties. For pay-for-click services, we introduce Internet users to our advertisers through our auction-based pay-for-click systems and charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links. Revenue for pay-for-click services is recognized on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links.\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou, and Changyou Share-based Awards\nConversion Rights\nWe had an operating loss of $117.1 million for 2016, compared to an operating profit of $82.5 million for 2015 and an operating loss of $205.0 million for 2014.\nOther (Expense)/Income\n\nFor our search and search-related business, Sogou is one of the top players in the online search sector in China. We have reinforced our competitive position through cooperation with Tencent, which has helped us build exclusive access to Tencent's social platforms and bring in unique and high-quality content. In 2016, we launched and upgraded a series of vertical channels, including English, Academic and Healthcare. These new services helped us stand out from competing products. By the end of December 2016, Sogou's mobile search traffic grew 70% from the same period in 2015, contributing 75% of aggregate traffic. Mobile search revenues accounted for two-thirds of total search revenues. During 2016, we also made solid progress in artificial intelligence, in particular with voice technology. The daily use of voice input through Sogou Mobile Keyboard more than doubled from a year ago. Due to newly-imposed regulations for online advertising that tightened the scrutiny of advertiser qualifications, Sogou's revenue growth for 2016 decelerated from previous years'.\nSohu\nOther revenues attributable to Changyou are primarily from its cinema advertising business and from IVAS.\nNoncontrolling Interest Recognition\nCost of Online Advertising Revenues\nFixed assets mainly comprise office buildings, computer equipment and hardware, leasehold improvements, office furniture, and vehicles. Fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nFor Changyou's PC game business, the PC game TLBB experienced a relatively large drop in revenue at the beginning of 2016, and Changyou immediately adjusted its operational strategy to focus on user stabilization by cutting down on the number of in-game promotions, improving in-game content and strengthening social functionality. The revenues of TLBB remained stable throughout the year, with slight increases in the third and fourth quarters on a sequential basis. For Changyou's mobile game business, revenues from TLBB 3D declined sequentially mainly due to its natural declining life cycle. In order to extend the game's life span, Changyou will explore new social interactive features that can be added to the game. Overall, Changyou started at the beginning of 2016 to focus on producing high-quality games. This approach and higher testing standards have set the bar high for new games in the pipeline, which had an impact on 2016 revenues. Nevertheless, after a year of hard work, Changyou now has a solid pipeline with a focus on MMORPG games, and supplemented by a number of advanced casual games in 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the PC games and mobile games that Changyou operates had approximately 4.1 million total average monthly active accounts and approximately 1.4 million total active paying accounts.\n \u2022 Sogou Technology. Sogou Technology qualified as an HNTE for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017. \nThe CIT Law and its implementing regulations provide that a \u201cSoftware Enterprise\u201d is entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its first profitable year and a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years. An entity that qualifies as a \u201cKey National Software Enterprise\u201d (a \u201cKNSE\u201d) is entitled to a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10%. Enterprises wishing to enjoy the status of a Software Enterprise or KNSE must perform a self-assessment each year to ensure they meet the criteria for qualification and file required supporting documents with the tax authorities before using the preferential CIT rates. These enterprises will be subject to the tax authorities' assessment each year as to whether they are entitled to use the relevant preferential CIT treatments. If at any time during the preferential tax treatment years an enterprise uses the preferential CIT rates but the relevant authorities determine that it fails to meet applicable criteria for qualification, the relevant authorities may revoke the enterprise's Software Enterprise/KNSE status.\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders was nil for 2016, compared to $11.9 million and $27.7 million, for 2015 and 2014.\nComprehensive Income\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nSohu\nIn determining the fair value of share options granted by Sogou as share-based awards, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. Certain persons who became Sogou employees when Tencent's Soso search-related businesses were transferred to Sogou on September 16, 2013 had been granted restricted share units under Tencent's share award arrangements prior to the transfer of the businesses to Sogou. These Tencent restricted share units will continue to vest under the original Tencent share award arrangements provided the transferred employees continue to be employed by Sogou during the requisite service period. After the transfer of the Soso search-related businesses to Sogou, Sogou applied the guidance in ASC 505-50 to measure the related compensation expense, based on the then-current fair value at each reporting date, as the expense is deemed to have been incurred by Tencent as an investor on Sogou's behalf. To determine the then-current fair value of the Tencent restricted share units granted to these employees, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was applied. Because Sogou is not required to reimburse Tencent for such share-based compensation expense, the related amount was recorded by Sogou as a capital contribution from Tencent.\nIncome tax expense was $21.1 million for 2016, compared to $76.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease mainly resulted from a reversal of PRC income tax expenses of $10.6 million and $6.4 million by Changyou and Sogou, respectively, for the preferential tax rate that Changyou's and Sogou's subsidiaries received in 2016 as KNSEs or Software Enterprises for 2015, as well as a reversal by Sohu of U.S. income tax expense of $5.0 million for the disposal of an equity investment that occurred in 2015 and was determined in 2016 to be nontaxable. The decrease was also attributable to a decline in profit before tax of our tax-paying entities.\nFor investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets, we elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments subsequently at fair value. Changes in fair values are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nAs Changyou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Changyou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting the economic interest in Changyou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cChangyou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, based on their share of the economic interest in Changyou. Changyou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity, adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and adjustment for changes in our ownership in Changyou, are recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCost of Search and Search-related Revenues\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe year-on-year increase for 2016 was $50.8 million, representing year-on-year growth of 13%. The increase mainly consisted of a $73.3 million increase in advertising and promotional expenditures, offset by a $18.0 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, and a $1.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense.\n \u2022 Sohu Media Portal  Revenues from Sohu Media Portal were $181.8 million for 2016, compared to $197.6 million for both 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $15.8 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 8% compared to 2015, while revenues for 2015 were flat compared to 2014. In 2016, while the slowdown in the growth of the economy in China shrank the budgets of brand advertisers, rapid growth in the number of small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers advertising on Sohu Media Portal helped offset the impact to some extent. The number of advertisers for Sohu Media Portal was 4,259 for 2016, compared to 3,471 and 2,673, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $43,000 for 2016, compared to $57,000 and $74,000, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the following principal entities were qualified as HNTEs and were entitled to an income tax rate of 15%.\nSohu Video enters into nonmonetary transactions to exchange online broadcasting rights for purchased video content with other online video broadcasting companies. Under ASC 845, the cost of a nonmonetary asset acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary asset is the fair value of the asset surrendered to obtain the acquired nonmonetary asset, and a gain or loss should be recognized on the exchange. The fair value of the asset received should be used to measure the cost if the fair value of the asset received is more reliable than the fair value of the asset surrendered. We record these nonmonetary exchanges at the fair values of the online broadcasting rights for purchased video content and recognize any net gain or loss from such exchange transactions.\nCost of Revenues\n(ii) additional net income is allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares to bring its basis back;\n\nOther Revenues\nSogou\n (2) Quarterly Aggregate Active Paying Accounts for a given quarter refers to the number of accounts from which game points are used at least once during the quarter. \nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $53.3 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 31%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $22.1 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $14.6 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $7.4 million decrease in facilities expenses, a $6.2 million decrease in professional fees, and a $3.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nWe believe our current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs (net cash used in operating activities), commitments, capital expenditures, and investment activities over the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions and other future developments, or changes in general economic conditions.\nChangyou provides IVAS primarily through software applications for PCs and mobile devices offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser and by RaidCall. Revenues from IVAS are recognized during the period the service rendered or items consumed under the gross method, as Changyou is the principal obligor for provision of the services.\nFor Sohu's Business\nFinancial statements of entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, which is the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders' equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders' equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the year, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate each period's income statement. Differences resulting from translating a foreign currency to the reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\nKey Terms of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares\nBasic net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with performance requirements is not considered before the performance targets are actually met. The computation of diluted net income / (loss) per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net income / (loss) per share. Additionally, for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income / (loss) per share, the net income / (loss) attributable to the Sohu Group is adjusted as follows. The adjustment will not be made if there is an anti-dilutive effect.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nIn 2014, we recognized $52.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisitions. This $52.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for intangible assets related to RaidCall, which was acquired by Changyou in 2013, as Changyou management determined that RaidCall's audio communication technology was not a good fit for Changyou's online games business.\nMobile Games\nThe year-on-year increase for 2015 was $75.0 million, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 46%. The increase mainly consisted of a $58.1 million increase in traffic acquisition costs, a $13.5 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs, and a $3.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of fixed assets is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell the relevant assets and is recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe Sogou Preferred Shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders.\nCost of Online Game Revenues\n \u2022 Gamespace. In 2016, Gamespace was in the third of three years in which it was entitled to a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% as a Software Enterprise. Gamespace will need to re-apply in 2017 for qualification as a Software Enterprise for 2016. \nCPC model\nAs Sogou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Sogou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting economic interests in Sogou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cSogou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Sogou's net income/(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Sogou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity/(deficit) and adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders' investments in Sogou's Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares (collectively, the \u201cSogou Preferred Shares\u201d) and Ordinary Shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in our consolidated balance sheets, as we have the right to reject a redemption requested by the noncontrolling shareholders. These treatments are based on the terms governing investment, and on the terms of the classes of Sogou shares held, by the noncontrolling shareholders in Sogou.\nWe are subject to various taxes in different jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. and the PRC. Management reviews regularly the adequacy of the provisions for taxes as they relate to our income and transactions. In order to assess uncertain tax positions, we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition. For the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement.\nUnder the CPC model, there is no overall fixed price for advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. We charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the advertisements. The unit price for each click is auction-based. We recognize revenue based on qualifying clicks and the unit price.\n\nChangyou is the primary obligor of its self-operated games. Changyou hosts the games on its own servers and is responsible for the sale and marketing of the games as well as customer service. Accordingly, revenues are recorded gross of revenue sharing-payments to third-party developers and/or mobile APP stores, but are net of business tax/VAT and discounts to game card distributors where applicable. Changyou obtains revenues from the sale of in-game virtual items. Revenues are recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased by game players or as the virtual items are consumed. If different assumptions were used in deriving the estimated lives of the virtual items, the timing of the recording of the revenues would be impacted.\n\nCollateral related to Sogou Incentive Shares Trust Arrangements\nCost of Brand Advertising Revenues\nOnline Advertising Revenues\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $224.0 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc. for 2016, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million and $166.7 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc., respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nCost of online game revenues mainly consists of revenue-sharing payments, salary and benefits expense, bandwidth leasing costs, content and license costs, amortization and depreciation expenses, and other direct costs.\nIn its cinema advertising business, Changyou provides clients advertising placements in slots that are shown in theaters before the screening of movies. The rights to place advertisements in such advertising slots are granted under contracts Changyou signs with different theaters. When all the recognition criteria are met, revenues from cinema advertising are recognized based on a percentage of the advertising slots actually delivered or on a straight-line basis over the contract period.\nProduct Development Expenses\nWe treat advertising contracts with multiple deliverable elements as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and recognizes revenue on a periodic basis during the contract period when each deliverable service is provided. Since the contract price is for all deliverables under one advertising contract, we allocate the contract price among all the deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No. 2009-13.We first use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price does not exist, we use third-party evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use management's best estimate of selling price for the deliverables.\nInvestments in debt securities and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values not classified as trading securities or as held-to-maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, and are included in long-term investments. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income or losses in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the period in which the gain or loss is realized. An impairment loss on the available-for-sale securities is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nOperating Expenses\nIn 2015, we recognized $40.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisition. This $40.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $29.6 million goodwill impairment loss and a $8.9 million intangible assets impairment loss related to MoboTap. As the financial performance of the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap was below original expectations, Changyou's management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou's platform channel business.\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10-35, we review the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of long-lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management. An impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nSohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, is a leading Chinese online media, search and game service group providing comprehensive online products and services on PCs and mobile devices in the People's Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d). Our businesses are conducted by Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and VIEs (collectively referred to as the \u201cSohu Group\u201d or the \u201cGroup\u201d). The Sohu Group consists of Sohu, which when referred to in this report, unless the context requires otherwise, excludes the businesses and the corresponding subsidiaries and VIEs of Sogou Inc. (\u201cSogou\u201d) and Changyou.com Limited (\u201cChangyou\u201d), Sogou and Changyou. Sogou and Changyou are indirect controlled subsidiaries of Sohu.com Inc. Sohu is a leading Chinese language online media content and services provider. Sogou is a leading online search, client software and mobile Internet product provider in China. Changyou is a leading online game developer and operator in China as measured by the popularity of its PC game TLBB and its mobile game TLBB 3D, and engages primarily in the development, operation and licensing of online games for PCs and mobile devices. Most of our operations are conducted through our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs.\nRevenue Recognition\nFixed Price model\n (1) Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Sogou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Sogou Preferred Shares and Ordinary Shares, shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if-converted method, and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and is not determined by allocating Sogou's net income /(loss) to Sohu.com Inc. using the methodology for the calculation of net income /(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders.  In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income / (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, the percentage of Sohu.com Inc.'s shareholding in Sogou was calculated by treating convertible preferred shares issued by Sogou as having been converted at the beginning of the period and unvested Sogou share options with the performance targets achieved as well as vested but unexercised Sogou share options as having been exercised during the period. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with a performance requirement was not considered before the performance targets were actually met. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Sogou shares and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted income /(loss) per share. As a result, Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nKey Terms of Sogou Preferred Shares\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $12.1 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 3%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $22.3 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $4.1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses and a $1.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, offset by a $18.8 million increase in content and license costs, and an impairment of purchased video content.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\nPrincipal Entities Qualified as Software Enterprises and KNSE\nDividend Rights\nForeign exchange forward contracts are initially recognized on the date a foreign exchange forward contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Changyou entered into such foreign exchange forward contracts in compliance with its risk management policy for the purpose of eliminating the negative impact on earnings and equity resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. The instruments are marked-to-market at each period-end with the associated changes in fair value recognized in the line item \u201cOther income /(expense), net\u201d in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and \u201cOther short-term liabilities\u201d or \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nBasis of Consolidation\nFunctional Currency and Foreign Currency Translation\nCost of online game revenues was $96.2 million for 2016, compared to $156.3 million and $142.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nEach Sogou Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder. Each Sogou Preferred Share is convertible into such number of Class A Ordinary Shares as is determined, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, by dividing $0.625 by the then-effective conversion price for Series A Preferred Shares, which is initially $0.625, and, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, by dividing $7.267 by the then-effective conversion price for Series B Preferred Shares, which is initially $7.267. The conversion prices of the Sogou Preferred Shares are subject to adjustment on a weighted average basis upon the issuance of additional equity shares, or securities convertible into equity shares, at a price per share less than $0.625, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, or less than $7.267, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, subject to certain customary exceptions, such as shares issued pursuant to the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan. Each Sogou Preferred Share will be automatically converted into Class A Ordinary Shares of Sogou upon the closing of a qualified IPO of Sogou based on the then-effective conversion ratio of such Sogou Preferred Share, which is currently one-for-one for both Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares.\n(ii) additional net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\nRedemption Rights\nAs of December 31, 2016, unrecognized share-based compensation expense for Sohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou and Changyou share-based awards was as follows (in thousands):\nThe year-on-year increase in cost of online game revenues for 2015 was $13.8 million, representing year-on-year growth of 10%. The increase mainly consisted of a $53.8 million increase in revenue-sharing payments to mobile application stores, offset by a $19.0 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $6.1 million decrease in PRC business tax and value-added tax, a $5.8 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $3.8 million decrease in depreciation expenses and a $2.7 million decrease in revenue-sharing payments to third-party developers.\nCompensation Expense Recognition\nGoodwill Impairment and Impairment of Intangibles Acquired as Part of Business Acquisition\nSee Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to China's Regulation Environment - Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our revenues effectively,\u201d \u201c-Our offshore entities may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by the China-based subsidiaries of our subsidiaries Sohu.com Limited, Sogou and Changyou to fund any cash requirements those offshore entities may have. Our offshore entities may not be able to obtain cash from distributions because our subsidiaries and VIEs in China are subject to restrictions imposed by PRC law, and may be subject to future debt covenant restrictions, on paying such dividends or making other payments,\u201d and \u201c- Dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC are subject to PRC profit appropriation and PRC withholding tax,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure - Although the Sohu Group holds substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents is held by Changyou and Sogou, and it can be difficult for Sohu to have access to the portion held by Changyou and Sogou. See also \u201cRestrictions and Limitations on Cash Available to Sohu.com Inc.\u201d below and\nSearch and Search-related Revenues\nIncome Tax Expense\n(v) further net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nCost of online advertising revenues includes cost of revenues from brand advertising services as well as cost of revenues from search and search-related services.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, we report in our financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. If a measurement period adjustment is identified, we recognize the adjustment as part of the acquisition accounting. We increase or decrease the provisional amounts of identifiable assets or liabilities by means of increases or decreases in goodwill for measurement period adjustments.\nInvestments in entities are recorded as equity investments under long-term investments. For entities over which we do not have significant influence, the cost method is applied, as there is no readily determinable fair value; for entities over which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or control, the equity method is applied. For cost method investments, we carry the investment at historical cost after the date of investment. For equity method investments, we adjust the carrying amount of an investment and recognize investment income or loss for our share of the earnings or loss of the investee after the date of investment.\nUnder the e-commerce model, revenues were mainly generated from sales of membership cards which allow potential home buyers to purchase specified properties from real estate developers at a discount greater than the price that Focus charges for the card. Membership fees are refundable until the potential home buyer uses the discounts to purchase properties. Focus recognizes such revenues upon obtaining confirmation that the membership card has been redeemed to purchase a property.\nOther revenues attributable to Sogou are primarily IVAS revenues derived from the operation of Web games and mobile games of third-party developers as well as other services and products that Sogou provides to users.\n (2) Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Changyou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and not by using the percentage held by Sohu.com Inc. of the total economic interest in Changyou, which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share.  In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income/ (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, all of Changyou's existing unvested restricted share units and share options, and vested restricted share units and share options that have not yet been settled, are treated as vested and settled by Changyou under the treasury stock method, causing the percentage of the weighted average number of shares held by Sohu.com Inc. in Changyou to decrease. As a result, Changyou's net income / (loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis decreased accordingly. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Changyou restricted share units and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income /(loss) per share. As a result, Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nVideo Content\nAn entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management's judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency of Sohu.com Inc. is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the U.S., the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries and VIEs in other countries are the national currencies of those counties, rather than the U.S. dollar.\nRecognition\nLiquidity Sources and Balances\nInterest Expense\nOther expense was $10.7 million for 2016, compared to other income of $74.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The changes were mainly due to a disposal gain of $55.1 million recognized by Changyou for its sale of the 7Road business and certain Changyou subsidiaries during the third quarter of 2015, and a $27.8 million one-time expense recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to a donation by Sogou to Tsinghua University related to setting up a joint research institute focusing on artificial intelligence technology.\nBoth pay-for-click services and online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou expand distribution of advertisers' promotional links or advertisements by leveraging traffic on Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties including Web content, software and mobile applications. We recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees we receive from advertisers, as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability. Payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members are included in cost of search and search-related revenues as traffic acquisition costs. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based on either revenue-sharing arrangements, under which we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of their properties, or on a pre-agreed unit price.\n(iv) further net losses are allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nBrand advertising revenues were $448.0 million for 2016, compared to $577.1 million and $541.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $129.1 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $35.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 22% for 2016 and a year-on-year increase of 7% for 2015. The year-on-year fluctuations in brand advertising revenues for 2016 and 2015 were both mainly from Sohu Video.\nRestricted Time Deposits\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $115.0 million for 2016, compared to net income of $108.9 million and a net loss of $171.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.05 billion, and short-term investments of $247.9 million. Of our cash and cash equivalents, $393.9 million was held in financial institutions inside Mainland China and $657.1 million was held in financial institutions outside of Mainland China. Our VIEs held $94.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and $956.1 million was held outside of our VIEs.\n(i) net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou until their basis in Sogou increases to zero;\n \u2022 Wuhan Baina Information. In 2016, Wuhan Baina Information was in the first of two years in which it is entitled to income tax exemption as a Software Enterprise. Wuhan Baina Information will need to apply in 2017 for qualification as a Software Enterprise for 2016.  PRC Withholding Tax on Dividends\nCommencing in 2012, we had, through Changyou, loans from offshore banks secured by RMB deposits in onshore branches of those banks. The loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as short-term bank loans or long-term bank loans based on their repayment period. The rates of interest under the loan agreements with the lending banks were determined based on the prevailing interest rates in the market. The RMB onshore deposits securing the offshore loans are treated as restricted time deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2016, Changyou repaid all of the remaining bank loans, and restricted time deposits that secured these loans were released.\nCost of other revenues mainly consists of payments to theaters and film production companies for pre-film screening advertising slots, content and license costs related to paid subscription services, revenue-sharing payments related to the IVAS business, and revenue-sharing payments related to interactive broadcasting services.\nFor share-based awards for which a grant date has occurred, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the fair value of the related share-based awards on their grant dates. For share-based awards for which the service inception date precedes the grant date, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning on the service inception date and is re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the related share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is charged to the shareholders' equity or noncontrolling interest section in the consolidated balance sheets. The assumptions used in share-based compensation expense recognition represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change or different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different for any period. Moreover, the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes.\nEquity Investments\nWith the accelerated shift in user activities from PCs to mobile devices and an increase in the number of Internet users, the use of various kinds of mobile Internet services continued to increase. As of the end of December 2016, according to China Internet Network Information Center (\u201cCNNIC\u201d), mobile internet users had reached 695 million, an increase of 12% from the end of 2015. At Sohu, we focused our efforts on developing a portfolio of leading mobile products across our business lines that we believed our users would like.\nPRC Value Added Tax\nOnline advertising revenues were $1.05 billion for 2016, compared to $1.12 billion and $899.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $71.5 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $217.6 million, representing a year-on-year decrease rate of 6% for 2016 and a year-on-year growth rate of 24% for 2015.\n \u2022 Sohu Video  Revenues from Sohu Video were $123.1 million for 2016, compared to $212.8 million and $175.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 decreased by $89.7 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 42% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 increased by $37.0 million, representing year-on-year growth of 21% compared to 2014. The changes were mainly attributable to fluctuations both in the number of advertisers and in the average amount spent per advertiser. The number of advertisers on Sohu Video was 455, 587 and 596, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $271,000, $363,000 and $295,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThe following is a summary of some of the key terms of the Sogou Preferred Shares under Sogou's Memorandum and Articles of Association as currently in effect.\nThe increase in revenues from search and search-related services was mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from pay-for-click services.\nOnline Advertising Revenues\nIntangible Assets\nSales and marketing expenses were $434.8 million for 2016, compared to $383.9 million and $526.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from other services were $209.6 million for 2016, compared to $183.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to a $26.0 million increase in revenues from the cinema advertisement business and from interactive broadcasting services. The year-on-year increase for 2015 was mainly due to revenue of $28.7 million from the film \u201cJian Bing Man\u201d that was produced by Sohu Video and released in 2015, and a $20.7 million increase in revenues from Changyou's cinema advertising business compared to 2014.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2016, Sogou had outstanding a combined total of 334,746,495 ordinary shares and preferred shares held as follows:\n(iii) additional net losses are allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares until its basis in Sogou decreases to zero; and\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2016. The data have been derived from our consolidated financial statements and, in our management's opinion, they have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the financial results for the periods presented. This information should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The operating results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidation Rights\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 36% of the outstanding equity capital of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis, assuming for such purpose that all share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised, and that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us. Also as of December 31, 2016, we held over 50% of the total voting power of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis and controlled the election of a majority of the Board of Directors of Sogou, assuming that Tencent's non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares are converted to voting shares, that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us, and that all Sogou share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all Sogou share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised.\n \u2022 Sogou Technology. Sogou Technology performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for KNSE status for 2015. Sogou Technology was qualified as a KNSE after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 10% for 2015. As a result, a reversal of income tax of $3.8 million for the preferential income tax rate was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Same process will be followed in 2017 by Sogou Technology for its preferential income tax treatment as a KNSE for 2016. \nChangyou's online game revenues are generated primarily from its self-operated and licensed-out PC games and mobile games. Prior to the sale of the 7Road business in 2015, Changyou generated online game revenues from Web games, which have been an insignificant part of Changyou's business since the sale. Changyou's online game revenues also include a small amount of revenues generated from online card and board games offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser. All of Changyou's games are operated under the item-based revenue model, where the basic game play functions are free of charge and players are charged for purchases of in-game virtual items, including those with a predetermined expiration time and perpetual virtual items.", "item_7_text": "Foreign exchange forward contracts\nFor brand advertising revenue recognition, prior to entering into contracts, we make a credit assessment of the advertiser. For contracts for which collectability is determined to be reasonably assured, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met. In other cases, we only recognize revenue when the cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n Note (1): Compensation expense for Sogou share-based awards includes compensation expense for Tencent restricted share units that Tencent had granted to employees who transferred to Sogou with the Soso search-related businesses.\nChangyou Share-based Awards\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEffective September 1, 2012, a pilot program (the \u201cPilot Program\u201d) for transition from the imposition of PRC business tax (\u201cBusiness Tax\u201d) to the imposition of VAT for revenues from certain industries was implemented in certain cities and provinces in China, including Beijing and Tianjin. Prior to the Pilot Program, the Group was mainly subject to a 5% PRC business tax and related surcharges on revenues in the PRC. PRC business tax and the related surcharges were recognized when the revenue was earned.\nChangyou Loans from Offshore Banks, Secured by Time Deposits\nChangyou\n(iv) further net income is allocated to holders of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and the holder of Sogou Class B Ordinary Shares to bring their basis back; and\nIn determining the fair value of stock options granted by Sohu (excluding Sohu Video) as share-based awards before 2006, the Black-Scholes valuation model was applied. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates was applied.\nNote (2): The negative amount resulted from re-measured compensation expense based on the then-current fair value of the awards on each reporting date.\nProduct development expenses mainly consist of salary and benefits expenses, content and license expenses, technical service fees, depreciation and amortization expenses, share-based compensation, and facilities expenses. These expenses are incurred for the enhancement and maintenance of our Internet platforms as well as for our products and services, including the development costs of online games prior to the establishment of technological feasibility and maintenance costs after the online games are available for marketing.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nThe carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. We make estimations of the collectability of accounts receivable. Many factors are considered in estimating the general allowance, including reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, performing an aging analysis and a customer credit analysis, and analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends.\nBy virtue of the terms of Sogou Preferred Shares and Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares, Sogou's losses are allocated in the following order:\nOnline Marketing Services on Web Directories Operated by Sogou\nU.S. Corporate Income Tax\nCash Equivalents\nSohu.com Inc. is a Delaware corporation that is subject to U.S. corporate income tax on its taxable income at a rate of up to 35%. To the extent that portions of its U.S. taxable income, such as Subpart F income or a dividend, are determined to be from sources outside of the U.S., subject to certain limitations, Sohu.com Inc. may be able to claim foreign tax credits to offset its U.S. income tax liabilities. Any remaining liabilities are accrued in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and estimated tax payments are made when required by U.S. law.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Changyou\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance, which required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a non-current amount in a classified balance sheet. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Additionally, the new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.\n Note (3): Includes the unrecognized compensation expense for employees who transferred from Tencent with Soso search-related businesses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues by source and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nCost of Revenues\nIn the event of any \u201cLiquidation Event,\u201d such as the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Sogou, a merger or consolidation of Sogou resulting in a change of control, the sale of substantially all of Sogou's assets or similar events, the holders of Series B Preferred Shares are entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) $6.847 plus any unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable if the Series B Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares prior the Liquidation Event, and holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive, after payment to the holders of the Series B Preferred Shares but before any payment to holders of Ordinary Shares, an amount equal to the greater of (i) 1.3 times their original investment in the Series A Preferred Shares plus all accrued but unpaid Accruing Dividends or (ii) such amount per share as would be payable if the Series A Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Liquidation Event.\nVIE Consolidation\nThe CIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax on dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises in the PRC to their immediate holding companies outside Mainland China. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the \u201cAvoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital,\u201d if such holding company is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%.\nCost of Online Game Revenues\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $142.6 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 27%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $113.1 million decrease in advertising and promotional expenditures, which was mainly due to Changyou's reduction in marketing and promotional spending for Changyou's platform channel business, a $18.1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, and a $5.6 million decrease in facility expenses.\nWeb Games\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Under ASC 350-20-35, we have the option to choose whether we will apply a qualitative assessment first and then a quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply a quantitative assessment directly. For reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first, we start the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. For reporting units directly applying the quantitative assessment, we perform the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair value, we perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nNet Loss attributable to Sohu.com Inc.\n Share-based compensation expense recognized for share awards of Sohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou, Changyou and Sohu Video was as follows (in thousands):\nLong-lived assets include fixed assets and intangible assets.\nFor purposes of ASC 718-10-25, as of December 31, 2016, no grant date had occurred, because the broader terms and conditions of the option awards had neither been finalized nor mutually agreed upon with the recipients. Therefore the fair value of the awards was not determinable and could not be accounted for. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, our management determined that the service inception date with respect to vested option awards for the purchase of 4,972,800 shares had preceded the grant date. Therefore, we recognized compensation expense for these vested Sohu Video share-based awards and re-measured, and will re-measure, the compensation expense on each subsequent reporting date based on the then-current fair values of these vested awards until the grant date is established.\n Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nPay-for-click Services\nRevenues from mobile games were $116.8 million for 2016, compared to $203.3 million and $66.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The dominant mobile game operated by Changyou was TLBB 3D. The year-on-year decrease in mobile game revenues for 2016 was $86.5 million, mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB 3D, which is an older mobile game. The year-on-year increase in mobile game revenues for 2015 was $137.1 million, mainly due to revenues from Changyou's primary mobile game TLBB 3D, which was launched in October, 2014.\nCost of other revenues was $102.4 million for 2016, compared to $80.6 million and $71.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase for 2016 was $21.8 million compared to 2015, which was mainly due to a $16.7 million increase in cinema advertising cost. The year-on-year increase for 2015 was $9.1 million compared to 2014, which was mainly due to $5.7 million in film production costs for \u201cJian Bing Man\u201d that were recognized in 2015.\nOther information\nOther Rights\nOn May 1, 2016, the transition from the imposition of Business Tax to the imposition of VAT was expanded to all industries in China, and all of our revenues have been subject to VAT since that date. To record VAT payable, we adopted the net presentation method, which presents the difference between the output VAT (at a rate of 6%) and the available input VAT amount (at the rate applicable to the supplier).\nThe year-on-year increase for 2015 was $75.5 million, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 25%. This increase mainly consisted of a $56.7 million increase in content and license costs, a $8.9 million increase in salary and benefits expenses and a $3.3 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs.\nOnline Game Revenues\n \u2022 AmazGame. AmazGame qualified as a KNSE and enjoyed a preferential income tax rate of 10% for each of 2013 and 2014. AmazGame performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for KNSE status for 2015. AmazGame was qualified as a KNSE after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 10% for 2015. As a result, a reversal of income tax of $10.6 million for the preferential income tax rate was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Same process will be followed in 2017 by AmazGame for its preferential income tax treatment as a KNSE for 2016. \nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future profitability, and tax planning strategies. If events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred. If events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nSohu (excluding Fox Video Limited), Sogou, Changyou, and Fox Video Limited (\u201cSohu Video\u201d) have incentive plans for the granting of share-based awards, including stock options, share options and restricted share units, to members of the boards of directors, management and other key employees.\nLevel 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n \u2022 Sohu New Momentum. In 2016, Sohu New Momentum was in the first of three years in which it is entitled to a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% as a Software Enterprise, subject to a requirement that it file documents in 2017 in order for the qualification to apply to 2016 and the following two years.  For Sogou's Business\nCost of Search and Search-related Revenues\nGeneral and administrative expenses mainly consist of salary and benefits expenses, professional service fees, facility expenses, travel expenses, share-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders\nOur search and search-related gross margin was 51% for 2016, compared to 56% and 54%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in our search and search-related gross margin for 2016 was mainly due to higher traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of search and search-related revenues.\nOur cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $119.8 million for 2016, compared to $173.2 million and $204.3 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nE-commerce model\nCosts and Expenses\nOptions for the purchase of Changyou Class A ordinary shares contractually granted under the Changyou 2014 Share Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Changyou and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair values at the grant date. In determining the fair values of Changyou share options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nProceeds from the self-operation of PC games are collected from players and third-party game card distributors through sales of Changyou's game points on its online payment platform and prepaid game cards.\nOn January 4, 2012, Sohu Video, the holding entity of Sohu's video division, adopted a 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the \u201cVideo 2011 Share Incentive Plan\u201d) which provides for the issuance of up to 25,000,000 ordinary shares of Sohu Video (representing approximately 10% of the outstanding Sohu Video shares on a fully-diluted basis) to management and key employees of the video division and to Sohu management. As of December 31, 2016, grants of options for the purchase of 16,368,200 ordinary shares of Sohu Video had been contractually made, of which options for the purchase of 4,972,800 ordinary shares were vested.\nFor options and restricted share units granted with respect to Sohu (excluding Sohu Video) shares and Changyou shares, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period. For share options granted with respect to Sogou shares, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period during which the service period requirement and performance target will be met. For Tencent restricted share units that Tencent had granted to employees who transferred to Sogou with the Soso search-related businesses, compensation expense is recognized by Sogou on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period, and the fair value of the share-based compensation is re-measured at each reporting date until vesting occurs. The number of share-based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated, and no compensation expense is recorded for the number of awards so estimated.\nOur financial instruments mainly include cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, assets held for sale, prepaid and other current assets, long-term investments (including available-for-sale equity securities), restricted time deposits, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, receipts in advance and deferred revenue, liabilities held for sale, other short-term liabilities and long-term accounts payable.\nCost of brand advertising revenues mainly consists of content and license costs, bandwidth leasing costs, and salary and benefits expense.\nVoting Rights\n \u2022 Sogou Information. Sogou Information qualified as an HNTE for 2015 to 2017, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2018. \nThrough PCs and mobile devices, we provide advertisement placements to our advertisers on different Internet platforms and in different formats, which include banners, links, logos, buttons, full screen, pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll video screens, pause video screens, loading page ads, news feed ads and in-feed video infomercial ads.\nFor self-operated mobile games, Changyou sells game points to its game players via third-party mobile APP stores. The mobile APP stores in turn pay Changyou proceeds after deducting their share of pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts.\nShort-term Investments\nOther Revenues\n Expenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred.\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments from owners and distributions to owners. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented on our consolidated balance sheets, includes a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and an unrealized gain/(loss) on available-for-sale securities.\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nSearch and search-related services primarily include pay-for-click services, as well as online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou.\nSohu Video Share-based Awards\nInterest income was $22.5 million for 2016, compared to $30.6 million and $37.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $45.0 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 11%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $25.6 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $10.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $7.8 million decrease in impairment provision for operating rights for licensed games with technological feasibility, and a $5.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $4.8 million increase in technical service fees.\nFor the E-commerce model, revenues were $54.7 million for 2016, compared to $54.2 million and $41.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 were flat compared to 2015, while year-on-year growth from 2014 to 2015 was 32%. The number of developers with which we had cooperation arrangements was 1,490, 1,015 and 808, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The number of paying subscribers for the membership services was 95,613, 94,149 and 73,232, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nSelf-Operated Games\nSegment Reporting\nBrand Advertising Revenues, Generated by Sohu and Changyou\nIntangible assets mainly comprise purchased video content, operating rights for licensed games, domain names and trademarks, computer software, developed technologies, and cinema advertising slot rights. Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value. Amortization of intangible assets other than purchased video content is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nPurchased video content is stated at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value (\u201cNRV\u201d).\nThe year-on-year decrease in cost of online game revenues for 2016 was $60.1 million. The decrease included a $35.4 million decrease in revenue-sharing payments to mobile APP stores, a $6.4 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $3.4 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $2.4 million decrease in content and license costs, and a $2.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nSelf-operated mobile games are either developed in house or licensed from or jointly developed with third-party developers. For licensed and jointly developed mobile games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to mobile application stores and third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\nThe holders of Sogou Preferred Shares have various other rights typical of preferred share investments.\nResources Analysis\nOur deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting basis and tax basis for our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs, which are subject to corporate income tax in the PRC under the CIT law.\n (1) Average Monthly Active Accounts for a given period refers to the number of registered accounts that were logged in to these games at least once during the period. \n \u2022 Focus  Revenues from Focus were $103.7 million for 2016, compared to $109.6 million and $108.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The revenues for 2016 decreased by $5.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 were generally stable compared to 2014.\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $31.2 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 15%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $23.7 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, which primarily resulted from a reduction in Changyou's workforce, a $12.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, and a $3.1 million decrease in travelling and entertainment expenses, offset by a $3.5 million increase in facility expenses, a $2.5 million increase in professional service fees, and a $2.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nUnder the Fixed Price model, a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided. We recognize revenue based on the contract price and the period of display.\nShare-based compensation expense was recognized in costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, as follows (in thousands):\n (i) Sohu.com Inc.: 131,697,750 Class A Ordinary Shares, of which 4,484,500 shares may be purchased by Sohu management and key employees under an option arrangement; \nFactors and Trends Affecting our Business\nNet income from Sogou is allocated in the following order:\nPC Games\nIn determining the fair value of ordinary shares and restricted share units granted by Changyou as share-based awards in 2008, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in 2009 shortly before Changyou's initial public offering, the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on Changyou's offering price for its initial public offering. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after Changyou's initial public offering, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates was applied.\nUnder the CPM model, the unit price for each qualifying display is fixed, but there is no overall fixed price for the advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. A qualifying display is defined as the appearance of an advertisement, where the advertisement meets criteria specified in the contract. We recognize revenue based on the fees we charge the advertisers, which are based on the unit prices and the number of qualifying displays.\nBrand Advertising Revenues\nPrinciples of Allocation of Sogou's Profit and Loss\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nIn accordance with ASC 920-350-35, if management's expectations of the programming usefulness of a program, series, package, or program segment are revised downward, it may be necessary to write down unamortized cost to estimated NRV. A write-down from unamortized cost to a lower estimated NRV establishes a new cost basis. Accordingly, we measure the video content's impairment loss by comparing its carrying value to its NRV. An impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying value of video content was lower than its NRV. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the NRV of video content exceeds its carrying value.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTaxation\nThe year-on-year increase for 2016 was $51.3 million, representing year-on-year growth of 21%. The increase mainly consisted of a $40.8 million increase in traffic acquisition costs and a $7.0 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs.\nChangyou continued to operate a small portfolio of self-operated Web games after its sale of the 7Road business in 2015. Proceeds from those Web games are collected from players through the sale of game points.\n (iii) Tencent: 6,757,875 Class A Ordinary Shares, 65,431,579 Series B Preferred Shares and 79,368,421 non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares; and \nWeb Games\nOur brand advertising gross margin was 17% for 2016, compared to 34% and 43%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-over-year decrease in our brand advertising gross margin for 2016 was mainly attributable to a decrease in advertising revenues and an increase in video content cost.\n \u2022 Sohu New Momentum. Sohu New Momentum qualified as an HNTE for 2016 to 2018, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2019. \nIn 2016, there was no goodwill impairment or impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are re-measured at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nNet Income /(Loss) per Share\nImpairment of Video Content\nBusiness Model\nGoodwill\nOVERVIEW\nIn February 2013, we deposited $9.0 million in cash into restricted time deposit accounts at a bank as collateral for credit facilities provided by the bank to certain Sogou employees. The facilities were intended to fund the employees' early exercise of Sogou share options and related PRC individual income tax. In the fourth quarter of 2016, all of these credit facilities were repaid to the bank and the $9.0 million restricted time deposit that secured these facilities was released.\nCPM model\nThere was no capitalized share-based compensation expense for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nThe following table presents our operating expenses by nature and by proportion for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nRevenues from the online game business were $395.7 million for 2016, compared to $636.8 million and $652.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of Changyou's older games, and a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015.\nBarter trade transactions in which physical goods or services (other than advertising services) are received in exchange for advertising services are recorded based on the fair values of the goods and services received. For online advertising-for-online advertising barter transactions, no revenue or expense is recognized because the fair value of neither the advertising surrendered nor the advertising received is determinable.\nPC games and Mobile Games\nSogou may not declare or pay dividends on its Class A Ordinary Shares or Class B Ordinary Shares (collectively, \u201cOrdinary Shares\u201d) unless the holders of the Sogou Preferred Shares then outstanding first receive a dividend on each outstanding Preferred Share in an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) the dividends that would have been payable to the holder of such Preferred Share if such share had been converted into Ordinary Shares, at the then-applicable conversion rate, immediately prior to the record date for such dividend, and (ii) all accrued and unpaid Accruing Dividends. \u201cAccruing Dividends\u201d are calculated from the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.0375 per Series A Preferred Share and from the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Shares at the rate per annum of $0.411 per Series B Preferred Share.\nFor Sohu's Business\nProduct development expenses were $353.1 million for 2016, compared to $398.1 million and $409.3 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\n \u2022 17173.com Website  Revenues from the 17173.com Website were $39.4 million for 2016, compared to $57.1 million and $59.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $17.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. The decreases were primarily a result of fewer PC games being marketed on the 17173.com Website. The number of advertisers on the 17173.com Website was 193, 194 and 168, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $204,000, $294,000 and $351,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nSearch and Search-related Revenues, Generated by Sogou\nCost of Online Advertising Revenues\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data for Changyou's PC games and mobile games for the periods indicated:\nRestricted time deposits are valued based on the prevailing interest rates in the market using the discounted cash flow method.\nOptions for the purchase of Sohu common stock contractually granted under the Sohu 2010 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Under ASC 718-10-25, no grant date can be established until a mutual understanding is reached between Sohu and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. In accordance with ASC 718-10-55, as the service inception date preceded the grant date, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date is established, based on the then-current fair value of the awards. The estimate of the awards' fair values will be fixed in the period in which the grant date occurs, and cumulative compensation expense will be adjusted based on the fair value at the grant date. In determining the fair values of the stock options granted, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used, and a binomial valuation model was applied.\nNet (Loss) / Income\nRevenues from PC games were $274.6 million for 2016, compared to $387.6 million and $485.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing 69%, 61% and 74%, respectively, of Changyou's online game revenues for the corresponding years. The dominant PC game operated by Changyou is TLBB. The year-on-year decreases in PC game revenues were $113.0 million and $97.5 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a year-on-year decrease of 29% and 20%. The year-on-year decrease in revenues from PC games was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of TLBB, which is an older PC game. In 2016, the PC game TLBB generated $219.7 million in revenues, accounting for approximately 56% of Changyou's online game revenues, approximately 42% of Changyou's total revenues and approximately 13% of the Sohu Group's total revenues.\nOnline marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou mainly consist of displaying advertisers' promotional links on the Web pages of Web directories. Revenue for online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou is normally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nNoncontrolling Interest for Sogou\nWe have changed the manner in which we classify our deferred tax assets and liabilities retrospectively from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to our early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. As a result of our adoption of this guidance, we reclassified our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 from current assets and liabilities to long-term assets and liabilities.\nFixed Assets\nCost of brand advertising revenues was $371.1 million for 2016, compared to $383.2 million and $307.7 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows generated from our operations. Cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Short-term investments comprise investment instruments issued by commercial banks in China, with a variable interest rate indexed to performance of underlying assets and maturity dates within one year.\nChangyou is a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 69% of the combined total of Changyou's outstanding ordinary shares, and controlled approximately 96% of the total voting power in Changyou.\nChangyou also authorizes third parties to operate its online games. Licensed out games include PC games and mobile games developed in house and mobile games jointly developed with third-party developers. Changyou receives monthly revenue-based royalty payments from all the third-party licensee operators. Changyou receives additional up-front license fees from certain third-party licensee operators who are entitled to an exclusive right to operate Changyou's games in specified geographic areas. Since Changyou is obligated to provide post-sale services, the initial license fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the license period, and the monthly revenue-based royalty payments are recognized when relevant services are delivered, provided that collectability is reasonably assured. Changyou views the third-party licensee operators as Changyou's customers and recognizes revenues on a net basis, as Changyou does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services. Changyou remits to the third-party developers a pre-agreed percentage of revenues from jointly developed and licensed out mobile games, and recognizes revenues on a net basis.\nPrincipal Entities Qualified as HNTEs\n\nChangyou\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2015 was $11.1 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 3%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $6.8 million decrease in content and license expense, a $6.8 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $5.6 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $2.9 million decrease in facility expenses, and a $0.7 million decrease in travelling and entertainment expenses, offset by a $8.4 million increase in impairment charges related to game copyrights of Changyou recognized in 2015 and a $3.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nOnline video services remained one of the most popular Internet applications, and continued to gain viewers from television stations. The video industry continued to be deeply competitive as major online platforms aggressively competed for popular content. The competition led to an escalation in the price of content. During 2016, Sohu Video began to shift our focus to the self-developed content category, which, in our view, will create long-lasting value to our platform and offer better financial returns compared to TV station content. Leveraging our exclusive original content, we also actively explored opportunities with subscription services that we believe will become an important revenue source in addition to traditional advertising revenues. Financially, Sohu Video's revenues for 2016 were affected by the weak economy and a turnover of the video sales team in the middle of the year, and its loss-making widened from 2015.\n \u2022 AmazGame and Gamease. AmazGame and Gamease each qualified as HNTEs for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017. \n \u2022 Sohu Era, Sohu Media and Guangzhou Qianjun. Sohu Era, Sohu Media and Guangzhou Qianjun each qualified as HNTEs for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017.  For Sogou's Business\nFor Changyou's Business\nRevenues from Web games were $4.3 million for 2016, compared to $45.9 million and $100.7 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues from Web games decreased $41.6 million and $54.8 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. The decrease in Web games revenues was mainly due to a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015.\nLicensed-Out Games\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three-tier fair value hierarchy is:\nLevel 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place.\n \u2022 Sohu Internet. Sohu Internet qualified as an HNTE for 2015 to 2017, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2018. \nSales and marketing expenses mainly consist of advertising and promotional expenses, salary and benefits expenses, travel expenses, and facility expenses. Advertising and promotional expenses generally represent the expenses of promotions to create or stimulate a positive image of us or a desire to subscribe for our products and services. Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred.\nOur net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $109.0 million for 2016, compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $146.5 million for 2015, and a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $32.3 million for 2014.\n (iv) Various employees of Sogou and Sohu: 19,490,870 Class A Ordinary Shares.  Sohu's Shareholding in and Control of Sogou\nOnline advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services as well as search and search-related services. We recognize revenue for the amount of fees we receive from our advertisers, after deducting agent rebates and net of value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and related surcharges.\nApplicable Income Tax Rate\nCost of Other Revenues\nThe estimated useful lives of our intangible assets are listed below:\n(iii) additional net income is allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares to bring their basis back;\nCost of Brand Advertising Revenues\nThe CIT Law generally applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises but grants preferential tax treatment to HNTEs. Under this preferential tax treatment, HNTEs can enjoy an income tax rate of 15%, but need to re-apply every three years. During this three-year period, an HNTE must conduct a qualification self-review each year to ensure it meets the HNTE criteria and is eligible for the 15% preferential tax rate for that year. If an HNTE fails to meet the criteria for qualification as an HNTE in any year, the enterprise cannot enjoy the 15% preferential tax rate in that year, and must instead use the regular 25% CIT rate.\nThe Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares have identical rights, except that Class B Ordinary Shares do not have voting rights unless the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares elect, by written notice to Sogou, to convert them into shares with voting rights.\nFor a discussion of changes in the basis of presentation for the periods presented below, see Item 7 \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe $27.7 million deemed dividend for 2014 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 14.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from China Web, and was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu, as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, in an amount equal to the proportionate difference between the price Sogou paid to China Web for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amount of these 14.4 million Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nSales to our five largest advertisers comprised approximately 11% of total brand advertising revenues for 2016, compared to 10% and 8%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $12.3 million, $21.4 million and $24.5 million, respectively, of receipts in advance from advertisers. As of December 31, 2016, we had obligations to provide, and advertisers had obligations to purchase, advertising services under existing contracts in the amount of $10.1 million, which are required to be provided during the year ending December 31, 2017.\nRevenues from Focus were generated through the Fixed Price model and the E-commerce model.\n (ii) Photon Group Limited, an investment vehicle of the Sohu Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Zhang (\u201cPhoton\u201d): 32,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares; \nOperating (Loss) / Profit\nVideo content consists primarily of purchased video content and self-developed video content. Purchased video content is recognized as intangible assets. Amortization of purchased video content is computed based on the trend in viewership accumulation. For self-developed video content, production costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for are expensed as incurred, instead of being recorded as intangible assets.\nFor the Fixed Price model, revenues were $49.0 million for 2016, compared to $55.4 million and $67.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decreases were $6.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for 2016 and 2015, representing a decrease of 12% and 18%, respectively. In the currently soft Chinese macro economy, advertisers from the real estate business are less willing to adopt the Fixed Price model, which caused our revenues from this model to decrease.\n \u2022 Sogou Network. Sogou Network qualified as an HNTE for 2016 to 2018, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2019. \n \u2022 Sogou Network. Sogou Network performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for Software Enterprise status for 2015. Sogou Network was qualified as a Software Enterprise after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 12.5% for 2015. \nFor Sohu Media Portal, we concentrated our focus on content and product design to accelerate the usage of our core mobile products - the Sohu News APP and the Web-based HTML5 Portal m.sohu.com. During 2016, we continued to optimize Sohu News App's design and introduce new features to meet users' appetites. At the same time, we ramped up marketing and promotion activities to accelerate the product's penetration. Daily active users of Sohu News APP continued to gain traction. On the sales front, in 2016 we experienced a modest decline in revenue for Sohu Media Portal as advertising revenues from large brand advertisers were soft due to the sluggish Chinese economy, while solid growth from small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers partially offset the negative impact.\nThe $11.9 million deemed dividend for 2015 resulted from Sogou's repurchase of 6.4 million Sogou Series A Preferred Shares from noncontrolling shareholders in September 2015. The deemed dividend was deemed to have been contributed by Sohu.com Inc., as a holder of ordinary shares of Sogou, representing a portion of the differences between the prices Sogou paid to Photon for the Series A Preferred Shares and the carrying amounts of these Series A Preferred Shares in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues from pay-for-click services accounted for approximately 82% of the total search and search-related revenues for 2016, compared to 82% and 80%, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The growth in revenues from pay-for-click services was principally attributable to an increase in the number of paid clicks, offset by depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Paid clicks increased by approximately 21% and 39%, respectively, driven by growth in mobile search traffic, for 2016 and 2015, compared to the prior year.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThrough the operation of Sohu, Sogou and Changyou, we generate online advertising revenues (including brand advertising revenues and search and search-related revenues), online games revenues and other revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total revenues were approximately $1.65 billion, representing an decrease of 15% compared to 2015, and our gross margin decreased from 56% to 48%. Our online advertising business generated revenues of $1.05 billion, with a 6% annual decline, representing 63% of total revenues. Our online game business generated revenues of $395.7 million, with a 38% annual decline, representing 24% of total revenues. In 2016, our net loss before deducting the noncontrolling interest was $119.3 million, compared to net profit of $108.9 million in 2015. In 2016, our net loss after deducting the noncontrolling interest was $224.0 million, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million in 2015. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. was $5.83 in 2016, compared to a diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. of $1.32 in 2015.\nCurrently we have four main types of pricing models, consisting of the Fixed Price model, the Cost Per Impression (\u201cCPM\u201d) model, the E-commerce model, and the Cost Per click (\u201cCPC\u201d) model.\nRevenues from search and search-related services were $597.1 million for 2016, compared to $539.5 million and $357.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 11% and 51%, respectively, for 2016 and 2015.\nRevenues\nInterest expense was $1.4 million for 2016, compared to $7.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of bank loans. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of our bank loans.\nCost of online advertising revenues was $661.2 million for 2016, compared to $622.1 million and $471.6 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase for 2016 and 2015 was $39.1 million and $150.5 million, respectively, representing year-on-year growth of 6% and 32%.\nCost of search and search-related revenues was $290.2 million for 2016, compared to $238.9 million and $163.9 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nInterest Income\nEach holder of Sogou Preferred Shares is entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of Class A Ordinary Shares into which the Sogou Preferred Shares held by such holder are then convertible.\nSogou's Share Structure\nOur Group's segments are business units that offer different services and are reviewed separately by the chief operating decision maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d), or the decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is Sohu.com Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer.\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate fair value using the income approach or market approach. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, control premium, comparable companies' multipliers, and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Identified below are the accounting policies that reflect our most significant estimates and judgments, and those that we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements.\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video) Share-based Awards\nCost of search and search-related revenues mainly consists of traffic acquisition costs, bandwidth leasing costs, depreciation expenses, as well as salary and benefits expenses. Traffic acquisition costs represent payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based either on revenue-sharing arrangements or on a pre-agreed unit price. Under the revenue-sharing arrangements, we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of the Website Alliance members' properties.\nProduct Development Expenses\nSelf-operated PC games are either developed in house or licensed from third-party developers. For licensed PC games, Changyou remits a pre-agreed percentage of the proceeds to the third-party developers, and keeps the balance pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements. Such revenue-sharing amounts paid to third-party developers are recorded in Changyou's cost of revenues.\n(i) net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and the holder of Sogou Class B Ordinary Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\nOur VIEs are wholly or partially owned by certain of our employees as nominee shareholders. For our consolidated VIEs, management made evaluations of the relationships between us and our VIEs and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of such contractual arrangements, we control the shareholders' voting interests in these VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of our consolidated VIEs.\nCost of Other Revenues\nSogou Share-based Awards\nFor Changyou's Business\nOther revenues attributable to Sohu consist primarily of revenues from paid subscription services, interactive broadcasting services, sub-licensing of purchased video content to third parties, content provided through the platforms of the three main telecommunications operators in China, and the filming business.\nNoncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity of subsidiaries and VIEs which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the controlling shareholder. Currently, the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of noncontrolling interests for Sogou and Changyou.\nOur online game gross margin was 76%, 75% and 78%, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. Gross margin for 2016 was stable compared to 2015, while it decreased by 3% from 2014 to 2015.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOnline Game Revenues Generated by Changyou\nPay-for-click services are services that enable our advertisers' promotional links to be displayed on Sogou search result pages and Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties where the links are relevant to the subject and content of such properties. For pay-for-click services, we introduce Internet users to our advertisers through our auction-based pay-for-click systems and charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links. Revenue for pay-for-click services is recognized on a per-click basis when the users click on the displayed links.\nSohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou, and Changyou Share-based Awards\nConversion Rights\nWe had an operating loss of $117.1 million for 2016, compared to an operating profit of $82.5 million for 2015 and an operating loss of $205.0 million for 2014.\nOther (Expense)/Income\n\nFor our search and search-related business, Sogou is one of the top players in the online search sector in China. We have reinforced our competitive position through cooperation with Tencent, which has helped us build exclusive access to Tencent's social platforms and bring in unique and high-quality content. In 2016, we launched and upgraded a series of vertical channels, including English, Academic and Healthcare. These new services helped us stand out from competing products. By the end of December 2016, Sogou's mobile search traffic grew 70% from the same period in 2015, contributing 75% of aggregate traffic. Mobile search revenues accounted for two-thirds of total search revenues. During 2016, we also made solid progress in artificial intelligence, in particular with voice technology. The daily use of voice input through Sogou Mobile Keyboard more than doubled from a year ago. Due to newly-imposed regulations for online advertising that tightened the scrutiny of advertiser qualifications, Sogou's revenue growth for 2016 decelerated from previous years'.\nSohu\nOther revenues attributable to Changyou are primarily from its cinema advertising business and from IVAS.\nNoncontrolling Interest Recognition\nCost of Online Advertising Revenues\nFixed assets mainly comprise office buildings, computer equipment and hardware, leasehold improvements, office furniture, and vehicles. Fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nFor Changyou's PC game business, the PC game TLBB experienced a relatively large drop in revenue at the beginning of 2016, and Changyou immediately adjusted its operational strategy to focus on user stabilization by cutting down on the number of in-game promotions, improving in-game content and strengthening social functionality. The revenues of TLBB remained stable throughout the year, with slight increases in the third and fourth quarters on a sequential basis. For Changyou's mobile game business, revenues from TLBB 3D declined sequentially mainly due to its natural declining life cycle. In order to extend the game's life span, Changyou will explore new social interactive features that can be added to the game. Overall, Changyou started at the beginning of 2016 to focus on producing high-quality games. This approach and higher testing standards have set the bar high for new games in the pipeline, which had an impact on 2016 revenues. Nevertheless, after a year of hard work, Changyou now has a solid pipeline with a focus on MMORPG games, and supplemented by a number of advanced casual games in 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the PC games and mobile games that Changyou operates had approximately 4.1 million total average monthly active accounts and approximately 1.4 million total active paying accounts.\n \u2022 Sogou Technology. Sogou Technology qualified as an HNTE for 2014 to 2016, and will need to re-apply for HNTE qualification in 2017. \nThe CIT Law and its implementing regulations provide that a \u201cSoftware Enterprise\u201d is entitled to an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its first profitable year and a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years. An entity that qualifies as a \u201cKey National Software Enterprise\u201d (a \u201cKNSE\u201d) is entitled to a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10%. Enterprises wishing to enjoy the status of a Software Enterprise or KNSE must perform a self-assessment each year to ensure they meet the criteria for qualification and file required supporting documents with the tax authorities before using the preferential CIT rates. These enterprises will be subject to the tax authorities' assessment each year as to whether they are entitled to use the relevant preferential CIT treatments. If at any time during the preferential tax treatment years an enterprise uses the preferential CIT rates but the relevant authorities determine that it fails to meet applicable criteria for qualification, the relevant authorities may revoke the enterprise's Software Enterprise/KNSE status.\nDividend or deemed dividend to noncontrolling Sogou Series A Preferred shareholders was nil for 2016, compared to $11.9 million and $27.7 million, for 2015 and 2014.\nComprehensive Income\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nSohu\nIn determining the fair value of share options granted by Sogou as share-based awards, the income approach /discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant. Certain persons who became Sogou employees when Tencent's Soso search-related businesses were transferred to Sogou on September 16, 2013 had been granted restricted share units under Tencent's share award arrangements prior to the transfer of the businesses to Sogou. These Tencent restricted share units will continue to vest under the original Tencent share award arrangements provided the transferred employees continue to be employed by Sogou during the requisite service period. After the transfer of the Soso search-related businesses to Sogou, Sogou applied the guidance in ASC 505-50 to measure the related compensation expense, based on the then-current fair value at each reporting date, as the expense is deemed to have been incurred by Tencent as an investor on Sogou's behalf. To determine the then-current fair value of the Tencent restricted share units granted to these employees, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was applied. Because Sogou is not required to reimburse Tencent for such share-based compensation expense, the related amount was recorded by Sogou as a capital contribution from Tencent.\nIncome tax expense was $21.1 million for 2016, compared to $76.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The decrease mainly resulted from a reversal of PRC income tax expenses of $10.6 million and $6.4 million by Changyou and Sogou, respectively, for the preferential tax rate that Changyou's and Sogou's subsidiaries received in 2016 as KNSEs or Software Enterprises for 2015, as well as a reversal by Sohu of U.S. income tax expense of $5.0 million for the disposal of an equity investment that occurred in 2015 and was determined in 2016 to be nontaxable. The decrease was also attributable to a decline in profit before tax of our tax-paying entities.\nFor investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets, we elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments subsequently at fair value. Changes in fair values are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nAs Changyou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Changyou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting the economic interest in Changyou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cChangyou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, based on their share of the economic interest in Changyou. Changyou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Changyou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity, adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and adjustment for changes in our ownership in Changyou, are recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCost of Search and Search-related Revenues\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe year-on-year increase for 2016 was $50.8 million, representing year-on-year growth of 13%. The increase mainly consisted of a $73.3 million increase in advertising and promotional expenditures, offset by a $18.0 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, and a $1.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense.\n \u2022 Sohu Media Portal  Revenues from Sohu Media Portal were $181.8 million for 2016, compared to $197.6 million for both 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $15.8 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 8% compared to 2015, while revenues for 2015 were flat compared to 2014. In 2016, while the slowdown in the growth of the economy in China shrank the budgets of brand advertisers, rapid growth in the number of small and medium enterprise (\u201cSME\u201d) customers advertising on Sohu Media Portal helped offset the impact to some extent. The number of advertisers for Sohu Media Portal was 4,259 for 2016, compared to 3,471 and 2,673, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $43,000 for 2016, compared to $57,000 and $74,000, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the following principal entities were qualified as HNTEs and were entitled to an income tax rate of 15%.\nSohu Video enters into nonmonetary transactions to exchange online broadcasting rights for purchased video content with other online video broadcasting companies. Under ASC 845, the cost of a nonmonetary asset acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary asset is the fair value of the asset surrendered to obtain the acquired nonmonetary asset, and a gain or loss should be recognized on the exchange. The fair value of the asset received should be used to measure the cost if the fair value of the asset received is more reliable than the fair value of the asset surrendered. We record these nonmonetary exchanges at the fair values of the online broadcasting rights for purchased video content and recognize any net gain or loss from such exchange transactions.\nCost of Revenues\n(ii) additional net income is allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares to bring its basis back;\n\nOther Revenues\nSogou\n (2) Quarterly Aggregate Active Paying Accounts for a given quarter refers to the number of accounts from which game points are used at least once during the quarter. \nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $53.3 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 31%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $22.1 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $14.6 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $7.4 million decrease in facilities expenses, a $6.2 million decrease in professional fees, and a $3.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nWe believe our current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs (net cash used in operating activities), commitments, capital expenditures, and investment activities over the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions and other future developments, or changes in general economic conditions.\nChangyou provides IVAS primarily through software applications for PCs and mobile devices offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser and by RaidCall. Revenues from IVAS are recognized during the period the service rendered or items consumed under the gross method, as Changyou is the principal obligor for provision of the services.\nFor Sohu's Business\nFinancial statements of entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, which is the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average of the exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders' equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders' equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the year, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate each period's income statement. Differences resulting from translating a foreign currency to the reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\nKey Terms of Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares\nBasic net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with performance requirements is not considered before the performance targets are actually met. The computation of diluted net income / (loss) per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net income / (loss) per share. Additionally, for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income / (loss) per share, the net income / (loss) attributable to the Sohu Group is adjusted as follows. The adjustment will not be made if there is an anti-dilutive effect.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nIn 2014, we recognized $52.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisitions. This $52.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for intangible assets related to RaidCall, which was acquired by Changyou in 2013, as Changyou management determined that RaidCall's audio communication technology was not a good fit for Changyou's online games business.\nMobile Games\nThe year-on-year increase for 2015 was $75.0 million, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 46%. The increase mainly consisted of a $58.1 million increase in traffic acquisition costs, a $13.5 million increase in bandwidth leasing costs, and a $3.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of fixed assets is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell the relevant assets and is recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe Sogou Preferred Shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders.\nCost of Online Game Revenues\n \u2022 Gamespace. In 2016, Gamespace was in the third of three years in which it was entitled to a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% as a Software Enterprise. Gamespace will need to re-apply in 2017 for qualification as a Software Enterprise for 2016. \nCPC model\nAs Sogou's controlling shareholder, we consolidate Sogou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting economic interests in Sogou held by shareholders other than us (the \u201cSogou noncontrolling shareholders\u201d). Sogou's net income/(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Sogou's cumulative results of operations attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders' equity/(deficit) and adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders' investments in Sogou's Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares (collectively, the \u201cSogou Preferred Shares\u201d) and Ordinary Shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in our consolidated balance sheets, as we have the right to reject a redemption requested by the noncontrolling shareholders. These treatments are based on the terms governing investment, and on the terms of the classes of Sogou shares held, by the noncontrolling shareholders in Sogou.\nWe are subject to various taxes in different jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. and the PRC. Management reviews regularly the adequacy of the provisions for taxes as they relate to our income and transactions. In order to assess uncertain tax positions, we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition. For the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement.\nUnder the CPC model, there is no overall fixed price for advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. We charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the advertisements. The unit price for each click is auction-based. We recognize revenue based on qualifying clicks and the unit price.\n\nChangyou is the primary obligor of its self-operated games. Changyou hosts the games on its own servers and is responsible for the sale and marketing of the games as well as customer service. Accordingly, revenues are recorded gross of revenue sharing-payments to third-party developers and/or mobile APP stores, but are net of business tax/VAT and discounts to game card distributors where applicable. Changyou obtains revenues from the sale of in-game virtual items. Revenues are recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased by game players or as the virtual items are consumed. If different assumptions were used in deriving the estimated lives of the virtual items, the timing of the recording of the revenues would be impacted.\n\nCollateral related to Sogou Incentive Shares Trust Arrangements\nCost of Brand Advertising Revenues\nOnline Advertising Revenues\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $224.0 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc. for 2016, compared to a net loss of $49.6 million and $166.7 million attributable to Sohu.com Inc., respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nCost of online game revenues mainly consists of revenue-sharing payments, salary and benefits expense, bandwidth leasing costs, content and license costs, amortization and depreciation expenses, and other direct costs.\nIn its cinema advertising business, Changyou provides clients advertising placements in slots that are shown in theaters before the screening of movies. The rights to place advertisements in such advertising slots are granted under contracts Changyou signs with different theaters. When all the recognition criteria are met, revenues from cinema advertising are recognized based on a percentage of the advertising slots actually delivered or on a straight-line basis over the contract period.\nProduct Development Expenses\nWe treat advertising contracts with multiple deliverable elements as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and recognizes revenue on a periodic basis during the contract period when each deliverable service is provided. Since the contract price is for all deliverables under one advertising contract, we allocate the contract price among all the deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No. 2009-13.We first use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price does not exist, we use third-party evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use management's best estimate of selling price for the deliverables.\nInvestments in debt securities and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values not classified as trading securities or as held-to-maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, and are included in long-term investments. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income or losses in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the period in which the gain or loss is realized. An impairment loss on the available-for-sale securities is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nOperating Expenses\nIn 2015, we recognized $40.3 million of goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles acquired as part of business acquisition. This $40.3 million impairment loss consisted primarily of a $29.6 million goodwill impairment loss and a $8.9 million intangible assets impairment loss related to MoboTap. As the financial performance of the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap was below original expectations, Changyou's management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou's platform channel business.\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10-35, we review the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of long-lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management. An impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nSohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, is a leading Chinese online media, search and game service group providing comprehensive online products and services on PCs and mobile devices in the People's Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d). Our businesses are conducted by Sohu.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and VIEs (collectively referred to as the \u201cSohu Group\u201d or the \u201cGroup\u201d). The Sohu Group consists of Sohu, which when referred to in this report, unless the context requires otherwise, excludes the businesses and the corresponding subsidiaries and VIEs of Sogou Inc. (\u201cSogou\u201d) and Changyou.com Limited (\u201cChangyou\u201d), Sogou and Changyou. Sogou and Changyou are indirect controlled subsidiaries of Sohu.com Inc. Sohu is a leading Chinese language online media content and services provider. Sogou is a leading online search, client software and mobile Internet product provider in China. Changyou is a leading online game developer and operator in China as measured by the popularity of its PC game TLBB and its mobile game TLBB 3D, and engages primarily in the development, operation and licensing of online games for PCs and mobile devices. Most of our operations are conducted through our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs.\nRevenue Recognition\nFixed Price model\n (1) Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Sogou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Sogou Preferred Shares and Ordinary Shares, shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if-converted method, and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and is not determined by allocating Sogou's net income /(loss) to Sohu.com Inc. using the methodology for the calculation of net income /(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders.  In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income / (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, the percentage of Sohu.com Inc.'s shareholding in Sogou was calculated by treating convertible preferred shares issued by Sogou as having been converted at the beginning of the period and unvested Sogou share options with the performance targets achieved as well as vested but unexercised Sogou share options as having been exercised during the period. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with a performance requirement was not considered before the performance targets were actually met. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Sogou shares and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted income /(loss) per share. As a result, Sogou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nKey Terms of Sogou Preferred Shares\nThe year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $12.1 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 3%. The decrease mainly consisted of a $22.3 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $4.1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses and a $1.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, offset by a $18.8 million increase in content and license costs, and an impairment of purchased video content.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\nPrincipal Entities Qualified as Software Enterprises and KNSE\nDividend Rights\nForeign exchange forward contracts are initially recognized on the date a foreign exchange forward contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Changyou entered into such foreign exchange forward contracts in compliance with its risk management policy for the purpose of eliminating the negative impact on earnings and equity resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. The instruments are marked-to-market at each period-end with the associated changes in fair value recognized in the line item \u201cOther income /(expense), net\u201d in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and \u201cOther short-term liabilities\u201d or \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nBasis of Consolidation\nFunctional Currency and Foreign Currency Translation\nCost of online game revenues was $96.2 million for 2016, compared to $156.3 million and $142.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nEach Sogou Preferred Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder. Each Sogou Preferred Share is convertible into such number of Class A Ordinary Shares as is determined, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, by dividing $0.625 by the then-effective conversion price for Series A Preferred Shares, which is initially $0.625, and, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, by dividing $7.267 by the then-effective conversion price for Series B Preferred Shares, which is initially $7.267. The conversion prices of the Sogou Preferred Shares are subject to adjustment on a weighted average basis upon the issuance of additional equity shares, or securities convertible into equity shares, at a price per share less than $0.625, in the case of Series A Preferred Shares, or less than $7.267, in the case of Series B Preferred Shares, subject to certain customary exceptions, such as shares issued pursuant to the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan. Each Sogou Preferred Share will be automatically converted into Class A Ordinary Shares of Sogou upon the closing of a qualified IPO of Sogou based on the then-effective conversion ratio of such Sogou Preferred Share, which is currently one-for-one for both Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares.\n(ii) additional net losses are allocated to holders of Sogou Series A Preferred Shares until their basis in Sogou decreased to zero;\nRedemption Rights\nAs of December 31, 2016, unrecognized share-based compensation expense for Sohu (excluding Sohu Video), Sogou and Changyou share-based awards was as follows (in thousands):\nThe year-on-year increase in cost of online game revenues for 2015 was $13.8 million, representing year-on-year growth of 10%. The increase mainly consisted of a $53.8 million increase in revenue-sharing payments to mobile application stores, offset by a $19.0 million decrease in salary and benefits expense, a $6.1 million decrease in PRC business tax and value-added tax, a $5.8 million decrease in bandwidth leasing costs, a $3.8 million decrease in depreciation expenses and a $2.7 million decrease in revenue-sharing payments to third-party developers.\nCompensation Expense Recognition\nGoodwill Impairment and Impairment of Intangibles Acquired as Part of Business Acquisition\nSee Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to China's Regulation Environment - Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our revenues effectively,\u201d \u201c-Our offshore entities may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by the China-based subsidiaries of our subsidiaries Sohu.com Limited, Sogou and Changyou to fund any cash requirements those offshore entities may have. Our offshore entities may not be able to obtain cash from distributions because our subsidiaries and VIEs in China are subject to restrictions imposed by PRC law, and may be subject to future debt covenant restrictions, on paying such dividends or making other payments,\u201d and \u201c- Dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC are subject to PRC profit appropriation and PRC withholding tax,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure - Although the Sohu Group holds substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents is held by Changyou and Sogou, and it can be difficult for Sohu to have access to the portion held by Changyou and Sogou. See also \u201cRestrictions and Limitations on Cash Available to Sohu.com Inc.\u201d below and\nSearch and Search-related Revenues\nIncome Tax Expense\n(v) further net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nCost of online advertising revenues includes cost of revenues from brand advertising services as well as cost of revenues from search and search-related services.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, we report in our financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. If a measurement period adjustment is identified, we recognize the adjustment as part of the acquisition accounting. We increase or decrease the provisional amounts of identifiable assets or liabilities by means of increases or decreases in goodwill for measurement period adjustments.\nInvestments in entities are recorded as equity investments under long-term investments. For entities over which we do not have significant influence, the cost method is applied, as there is no readily determinable fair value; for entities over which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or control, the equity method is applied. For cost method investments, we carry the investment at historical cost after the date of investment. For equity method investments, we adjust the carrying amount of an investment and recognize investment income or loss for our share of the earnings or loss of the investee after the date of investment.\nUnder the e-commerce model, revenues were mainly generated from sales of membership cards which allow potential home buyers to purchase specified properties from real estate developers at a discount greater than the price that Focus charges for the card. Membership fees are refundable until the potential home buyer uses the discounts to purchase properties. Focus recognizes such revenues upon obtaining confirmation that the membership card has been redeemed to purchase a property.\nOther revenues attributable to Sogou are primarily IVAS revenues derived from the operation of Web games and mobile games of third-party developers as well as other services and products that Sogou provides to users.\n (2) Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of Changyou shares held by Sohu.com Inc. represents of the weighted average number of Changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards under the treasury stock method, and not by using the percentage held by Sohu.com Inc. of the total economic interest in Changyou, which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share.  In the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income/ (loss) per share, assuming a dilutive effect, all of Changyou's existing unvested restricted share units and share options, and vested restricted share units and share options that have not yet been settled, are treated as vested and settled by Changyou under the treasury stock method, causing the percentage of the weighted average number of shares held by Sohu.com Inc. in Changyou to decrease. As a result, Changyou's net income / (loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis decreased accordingly. Assuming an anti-dilutive effect, all of these Changyou restricted share units and share options are excluded from the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s diluted net income /(loss) per share. As a result, Changyou's net income /(loss) attributable to Sohu.com Inc. on a diluted basis equals the number used for the calculation of Sohu.com Inc.'s basic net income /(loss) per share.\nVideo Content\nAn entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management's judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency of Sohu.com Inc. is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the U.S., the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries and VIEs in other countries are the national currencies of those counties, rather than the U.S. dollar.\nRecognition\nLiquidity Sources and Balances\nInterest Expense\nOther expense was $10.7 million for 2016, compared to other income of $74.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The changes were mainly due to a disposal gain of $55.1 million recognized by Changyou for its sale of the 7Road business and certain Changyou subsidiaries during the third quarter of 2015, and a $27.8 million one-time expense recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to a donation by Sogou to Tsinghua University related to setting up a joint research institute focusing on artificial intelligence technology.\nBoth pay-for-click services and online marketing services on Web directories operated by Sogou expand distribution of advertisers' promotional links or advertisements by leveraging traffic on Sogou Website Alliance members' Internet properties including Web content, software and mobile applications. We recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees we receive from advertisers, as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability. Payments made to Sogou Website Alliance members are included in cost of search and search-related revenues as traffic acquisition costs. We pay Sogou Website Alliance members based on either revenue-sharing arrangements, under which we pay a percentage of pay-for-click revenues generated from clicks by users of their properties, or on a pre-agreed unit price.\n(iv) further net losses are allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou.\nBrand advertising revenues were $448.0 million for 2016, compared to $577.1 million and $541.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $129.1 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $35.9 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 22% for 2016 and a year-on-year increase of 7% for 2015. The year-on-year fluctuations in brand advertising revenues for 2016 and 2015 were both mainly from Sohu Video.\nRestricted Time Deposits\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $115.0 million for 2016, compared to net income of $108.9 million and a net loss of $171.2 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.05 billion, and short-term investments of $247.9 million. Of our cash and cash equivalents, $393.9 million was held in financial institutions inside Mainland China and $657.1 million was held in financial institutions outside of Mainland China. Our VIEs held $94.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and $956.1 million was held outside of our VIEs.\n(i) net income is allocated between Sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in Sogou until their basis in Sogou increases to zero;\n \u2022 Wuhan Baina Information. In 2016, Wuhan Baina Information was in the first of two years in which it is entitled to income tax exemption as a Software Enterprise. Wuhan Baina Information will need to apply in 2017 for qualification as a Software Enterprise for 2016.  PRC Withholding Tax on Dividends\nCommencing in 2012, we had, through Changyou, loans from offshore banks secured by RMB deposits in onshore branches of those banks. The loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as short-term bank loans or long-term bank loans based on their repayment period. The rates of interest under the loan agreements with the lending banks were determined based on the prevailing interest rates in the market. The RMB onshore deposits securing the offshore loans are treated as restricted time deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2016, Changyou repaid all of the remaining bank loans, and restricted time deposits that secured these loans were released.\nCost of other revenues mainly consists of payments to theaters and film production companies for pre-film screening advertising slots, content and license costs related to paid subscription services, revenue-sharing payments related to the IVAS business, and revenue-sharing payments related to interactive broadcasting services.\nFor share-based awards for which a grant date has occurred, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the fair value of the related share-based awards on their grant dates. For share-based awards for which the service inception date precedes the grant date, share-based compensation expense is recognized as costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning on the service inception date and is re-measured on each subsequent reporting date before the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the related share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is charged to the shareholders' equity or noncontrolling interest section in the consolidated balance sheets. The assumptions used in share-based compensation expense recognition represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change or different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different for any period. Moreover, the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes.\nEquity Investments\nWith the accelerated shift in user activities from PCs to mobile devices and an increase in the number of Internet users, the use of various kinds of mobile Internet services continued to increase. As of the end of December 2016, according to China Internet Network Information Center (\u201cCNNIC\u201d), mobile internet users had reached 695 million, an increase of 12% from the end of 2015. At Sohu, we focused our efforts on developing a portfolio of leading mobile products across our business lines that we believed our users would like.\nPRC Value Added Tax\nOnline advertising revenues were $1.05 billion for 2016, compared to $1.12 billion and $899.0 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year decrease for 2016 was $71.5 million and the year-on-year increase for 2015 was $217.6 million, representing a year-on-year decrease rate of 6% for 2016 and a year-on-year growth rate of 24% for 2015.\n \u2022 Sohu Video  Revenues from Sohu Video were $123.1 million for 2016, compared to $212.8 million and $175.8 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. Revenues for 2016 decreased by $89.7 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 42% compared to 2015. Revenues for 2015 increased by $37.0 million, representing year-on-year growth of 21% compared to 2014. The changes were mainly attributable to fluctuations both in the number of advertisers and in the average amount spent per advertiser. The number of advertisers on Sohu Video was 455, 587 and 596, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average amount spent per advertiser was approximately $271,000, $363,000 and $295,000, respectively, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nThe following is a summary of some of the key terms of the Sogou Preferred Shares under Sogou's Memorandum and Articles of Association as currently in effect.\nThe increase in revenues from search and search-related services was mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from pay-for-click services.\nOnline Advertising Revenues\nIntangible Assets\nSales and marketing expenses were $434.8 million for 2016, compared to $383.9 million and $526.5 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from other services were $209.6 million for 2016, compared to $183.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, for 2015 and 2014. The year-on-year increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to a $26.0 million increase in revenues from the cinema advertisement business and from interactive broadcasting services. The year-on-year increase for 2015 was mainly due to revenue of $28.7 million from the film \u201cJian Bing Man\u201d that was produced by Sohu Video and released in 2015, and a $20.7 million increase in revenues from Changyou's cinema advertising business compared to 2014.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2016, Sogou had outstanding a combined total of 334,746,495 ordinary shares and preferred shares held as follows:\n(iii) additional net losses are allocated to the holder of Sogou Series B Preferred Shares until its basis in Sogou decreases to zero; and\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2016. The data have been derived from our consolidated financial statements and, in our management's opinion, they have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the financial results for the periods presented. This information should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The operating results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidation Rights\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 36% of the outstanding equity capital of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis, assuming for such purpose that all share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised, and that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us. Also as of December 31, 2016, we held over 50% of the total voting power of Sogou on a fully-diluted basis and controlled the election of a majority of the Board of Directors of Sogou, assuming that Tencent's non-voting Class B Ordinary Shares are converted to voting shares, that all of the Sogou Class A Ordinary Shares that Sogou has repurchased are re-issued to shareholders other than us, and that all Sogou share options under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and all Sogou share options under the Sohu Management Sogou Share Option Arrangement are granted and exercised.\n \u2022 Sogou Technology. Sogou Technology performed the self-assessment and filed required supporting documents in 2016 for KNSE status for 2015. Sogou Technology was qualified as a KNSE after the relevant government authorities' assessment and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 10% for 2015. As a result, a reversal of income tax of $3.8 million for the preferential income tax rate was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Same process will be followed in 2017 by Sogou Technology for its preferential income tax treatment as a KNSE for 2016. \nChangyou's online game revenues are generated primarily from its self-operated and licensed-out PC games and mobile games. Prior to the sale of the 7Road business in 2015, Changyou generated online game revenues from Web games, which have been an insignificant part of Changyou's business since the sale. Changyou's online game revenues also include a small amount of revenues generated from online card and board games offered by MoboTap on the Dolphin Browser. All of Changyou's games are operated under the item-based revenue model, where the basic game play functions are free of charge and players are charged for purchases of in-game virtual items,
