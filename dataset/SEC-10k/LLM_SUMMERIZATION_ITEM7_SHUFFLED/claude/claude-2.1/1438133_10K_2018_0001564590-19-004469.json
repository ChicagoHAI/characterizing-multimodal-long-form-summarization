We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our unique consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing, sales and support activities exclusively focus on our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim X2, and our complementary product offerings. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is based on our proprietary technology platform and is the smallest durable insulin pump available. It is the only pump currently available in the United States that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. By delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support, we aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and their healthcare providers.\nWe have commercially launched six insulin pumps in the United States since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Three of these pumps have featured continuous glucose monitoring technology, or CGM. In the past four years, we have shipped approximately 84,000 pumps, over 4,000 of which were in international markets, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer base on the typical four-year reimbursement cycle.\nDomestically, we began commercial sales of our first insulin pump product, t:slim, in August 2012 and subsequently commercialized t:flex in May 2015, t:slim G4 in September 2015, t:slim X2 in October 2016, t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration, or t:slim X2 with G5, in September of 2017 and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in August 2018. The Basal-IQ technology is our first-generation Automated Insulin Delivery, or AID, algorithm. This system uses Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor values to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. In the second quarter of 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, also created a new interoperability designation for integrated continuous glucose monitoring, or iCGM, devices. The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was the first insulin pump to receive approval for iCGM compatibility, which we expect will streamline the regulatory pathway for integration with future iCGM products as they are approved by the FDA. More recently, in early 2019 the FDA classified our t:slim X2 as the first insulin pump in a new device category referred to as Alternative Controller Enabled infusion pumps, or ACE pumps. We expect this new classification of the t:slim X2 will provide us with more flexibility as we make improvements to current products, create new products and collaborate with third-parties in the development of future AID systems. Interoperability with iCGM and other compatible devices will still require development effort and business agreements; however, the regulatory process can be lengthy and unpredictable, so we believe the FDA's designation of iCGM products and ACE pumps will, collectively, reduce the overall timeline to commercialize interoperable devices.\nIn the second half of 2018, we began selling the t:slim X2 with G5, in select geographies outside the United States, including Canada. We have discontinued sales of our original t:slim, t:flex and t:slim G4 pumps, and our t:slim X2 hardware platform now represents 100% of new pump shipments. However, we continue to provide ongoing service and support for our earlier products.\nOur insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to selling insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user's body.\nIn the United States, our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps' software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater provides our in-warranty domestic customers potential access to new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. The first use of our Tandem Device Updater was for our deployment of the latest t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. Since that time, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers in the United States two significant software updates: (i) integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system in September 2017; and (ii) an upgrade to our new Basal-IQ technology and integration with Dexcom's G6 CGM in August 2018. Our Tandem Device Updater positions us to bring future innovations and AID algorithms to t:slim X2 customers, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle. Though we have not utilized our Tandem Device Updater to perform software updates for devices outside the United States, we are currently developing that capability, and intend to do so in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated sales were $183.9 million, $107.6 million, and $84.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net loss was $122.6 million, $73.0 million, and $83.4 million, respectively. Worldwide pump sales accounted for 67%, 66%, and 74% of our total sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, while pump-related supplies and accessories accounted for the remainder in each year. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $600.1 million and $477.6 million, respectively. This included $147.4 million and $56.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation charges and non-cash changes in the fair value of common stock warrants as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn the United States, we have rapidly increased sales since our commercial launch by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing organization, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. More recently, our sales have also rapidly increased following the scaled launch of t:slim X2 in geographies outside the United States. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market both domestically and outside of the United States. We also believe we are well positioned to address consumers' needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers access to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the FDA, and as we develop the capability to offer the Tandem Device Updater outside the United States. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, we are able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In the United States, we are able to leverage a single sales, marketing, and clinical organization, as well as our domestic customer support services. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and customer support infrastructure, both of which benefit from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we have contracted with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform.\nProducts under Development\nOur products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include new AID systems, a next-generation hardware platform, and connected (mobile) health offerings. We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionalities that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.\nOur current products under development include:\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> t:slim X2 with Control IQ Technology: Our second-generation AID system is expected to integrate the t:slim X2 with the technology that we licensed from TypeZero and Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor. The iCGM designation for the system also provides the opportunity for integration development efforts with future iCGM sensors that may become available in the market. With our implementation of TypeZero's inControl AID algorithms, our product is intended to both increase and decrease basal insulin based on a user's predicted blood glucose levels from a compatible iCGM sensor, as well as deliver automated correction boluses. In conjunction with Dexcom and TypeZero, which was acquired by Dexcom in August 2018, we have integrated our technologies into the U.S. portion of the Clinical Acceptance of the Artificial Pancreas, or DCLP3, portion of the International Diabetes Closed Loop, or the IDCL, trial. Enrollment for the 6-month study was completed in October 2018. Our t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology has also been evaluated in several early pediatric studies and we intend to support a pivotal study among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes that will commence in the first half of 2019. Our goal is to commence commercial sales of the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology in the United States in the second half of 2019, followed by an international launch in 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> t:sport Insulin Delivery System: Expected to be half the size of our t:slim X2 pump, the t:sport pump is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump.

Subject to FDA approval, we intend to launch the first generation of our mobile application with a subset of these features in the United States in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information, see the section of this Annual Report under the caption Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nPump Shipments\nSince inception, we have derived nearly all of our sales from the shipment of insulin pumps and associated supplies in the United States. Starting in the third quarter of 2018, we commenced sales of our t:slim X2 insulin pump in select international geographies. We consider the number of units shipped per quarter to be an important metric for managing our business.\nIn 2018, we shipped 34,493 insulin pumps worldwide compared to 17,061 insulin pumps shipped in 2017. In the United States we have shipped more than 79,000 pumps within the four-year period ended December 31, 2018. Pump shipments in the United States by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years (1) - U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPump shipments to international customers by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years (1) - International\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The pump units shipped do not reflect returns or exchanges of pump products that occur in the ordinary course of business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> 2016 and 2017 U.S. shipments do not include approximately 3,300 trade-ins fulfilled under the Technology Upgrade Program (discussed below) related to our commercial launch of t:slim X2.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTechnology Upgrade Program\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017, we offered a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure, as a pathway for certain existing customers to obtain the t:slim X2. Due to the high degree of accounting complexity, the program created unpredictable financial results under U.S. GAAP for the duration of the program. The accounting treatment for the program required us to defer up to 100% of sales at the time of pump shipment and recognize them in a subsequent period, either when the upgrade was fulfilled or at the expiration of the program. We recognized the deferred amount of sales and cost of sales at the earlier of when the obligations under the program were satisfied or upon the expiration of the program. If a customer elected to participate in the program, we recognized any upgrade fees that we received and the associated costs at the time of fulfilling the given obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incremental net sales of $5.0 million with a corresponding increase of $3.1 million in gross profit as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a deferral of sales of $4.3 million and a net decrease in gross profit of $4.6 million as a result of the program. The program expired on September 30, 2017 and, therefore, has no impact on our 2018 financial results.\nTrends Impacting Financial Results\nOverall, we have experienced considerable sales growth since the commercial launch of our first product in the third quarter of 2012, while incurring operating losses since our inception. Our operating results have historically fluctuated on a quarterly or annual basis, particularly in periods surrounding anticipated regulatory approvals, and the commercial launch of products by us and our competitors.\nWe believe that our business condition and financial results, as well as the decision-making process of our customers, has been and will continue to be impacted by a number of general trends and factors, including the following:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> market acceptance of our products and competitive products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seasonality in the United States associated with annual insurance deductibles and coinsurance requirements associated with the medical insurance plans utilized by our customers and the customers of our distributors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of holidays and summer vacations which vary by geography;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the buying patterns of our distributors and other customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing of the commercialization of new products by us or our competitors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in the competitive landscape, including as a result of companies entering or exiting the diabetes therapy market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors, and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the magnitude and timing of any changes to our facilities, manufacturing operations and other infrastructure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> anticipated and actual regulatory approvals of our products and competitive products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn particular, we believe the following specific trends and factors have impacted, and could continue to materially impact our financial results going forward:\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continued increase in demand following the commercial launch of t:slim X2 and the demonstrated success of our Tandem Device Updater, which we expect will positively impact our sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> anticipated new product launches;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased opportunity to achieve customer renewals as customers become eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump at the end of the typical four-year reimbursement cycle;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> opportunity to attract Animas customers, following the announcement by Johnson & Johnson that it discontinued the operations of Animas and will discontinue availability of pump supplies in late 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> designation by UnitedHealthcare of one of our competitors as its preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers age seven and above, and;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expansion in select international geographies, which began in the third quarter of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to working to achieve our sales growth expectations, we intend to continue to leverage our infrastructure investments to realize additional manufacturing, sales, marketing and administration cost efficiencies to improve our operating margins, including costs associated with our international launch plans. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we achieved profitability for the first time. However, this may not be sustained in the near term. We believe we can ultimately achieve sustained profitability by driving incremental sales growth, meeting our pump renewal sales objectives, increasing gross profits from additional sales of infusion sets, maximizing manufacturing efficiencies on increased production volumes and leveraging the investments made in our sales, clinical, marketing and customer support organizations.\nSubsequent Events\nIn January 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for 25,332 square feet of additional general administrative office space located at 10935 Vista Sorrento Parkway, San Diego, California. Subject to limited exceptions, the initial lease term is expected to commence on the later of (i) March 1, 2019, or (ii) the date on which the landlord substantially completes certain specified work related to tenant improvements, such date, the Commencement Date, and will expire 42 months from the first day of the first full month following the Commencement Date. We also have a one-time option to extend the term of the lease for a period of five years by delivering prior written notice to the landlord in accordance with the terms of the lease.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nSales\nWe offer products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We commenced commercial sales of our original t:slim insulin pump platform in the United States in the third quarter of 2012 and continued to launch various iterations of that platform the following years. In October 2016, we began shipping our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 insulin pump. The t:slim X2 hardware platform, which includes remote software update capabilities, now represents 100% of our new pump shipments. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018 we discontinued new sales of all prior platform versions. Our products also include disposable cartridges and infusion sets. In addition, we offer accessories including protective cases, belt clips, and power adapters, although such sales are not significant.\nWe primarily sell our products through national and regional distributors in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. These distributors are generally providers of medical equipment and supplies to individuals with diabetes. Our primary end customers are people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Similar to other durable medical equipment, the primary payor is generally a third-party insurance carrier and the customer is usually responsible for any medical insurance plan copay or coinsurance requirements. We believe our existing sales, clinical, and marketing infrastructure will allow us to continue to increase sales by allowing us to promote our products to a greater number of potential customers, caregivers and healthcare providers.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 with G5 in select international geographies. With the exception of Canada where we intend to market with a direct sales force, we expect that most of our commercial sales outside the United States will initially be to independent distributors who will perform all sales, customer support and training in their respective territories. Historically, we have experienced consistent levels of reimbursement for our products in the United States, but the average sales price will vary in international markets based on a number of factors, such as the nature of the reimbursement environment, government regulations and the extent to which we rely on distributor relationships to provide sales, clinical and marketing support.\nIn general, in the United States we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, product shipments being weighted heavily towards the second half of the year, with the highest percentage of product shipments expected in the fourth quarter of the year due to the nature of the reimbursement environment. Consistent with our historical seasonality, we also expect domestic product shipments from the fourth quarter to the following first quarter to decrease significantly. Internationally, we do not expect this same impact from seasonality. However, the opportunity for the transition of former Animas customers in 2019 may also impact our quarterly sales trends worldwide.\nIn addition, our quarterly sales have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, substantially in the periods surrounding anticipated and actual regulatory approvals and commercial launches of new products by us or our competitors. For instance, customers may defer a purchasing decision if they believe that a new product may be launched in the future. Additionally, upon the announcement of FDA approval or commercial launch of a new product, either by us or one of our competitors, potential new customers may reconsider their purchasing decision or take additional time to consider the anticipated or new approval or product launch in their purchasing decision. However, we are not able to quantify the extent of the impact of these or similar events on future purchasing decisions.\nCost of Sales\nWe manufacture our pumps and disposable cartridges at our manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. Infusion sets and pump accessories are manufactured by third-party suppliers. Cost of sales includes raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses, product training costs, reserves for expected warranty costs, freight, scrap and inventory excess and obsolescence. Manufacturing overhead expenses include expenses relating to quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment, information technology and operations supervision and management. We anticipate that our cost of sales will continue to increase as our products gain broader market acceptance and our product sales increase.\nWe expect our overall gross margin percentage, which for any given period is calculated as sales less cost of sales divided by sales, to improve over the long-term, as our sales increase and our overhead costs are spread over larger production volumes. We expect we will be able to leverage our manufacturing cost structure across our products that utilize the same proprietary technology platform and manufacturing infrastructure, and will be able to further reduce costs with increased automation, process improvements and raw materials cost reductions. Pumps have, and are expected to continue to have, a higher gross margin than our pump-related supplies. Therefore, the percentage of pump sales relative to total sales will have a significant impact on gross margin. We also expect our warranty costs per unit to decrease as we release product features and functionality utilizing the Tandem Device Updater. However, our overall gross margin may fluctuate in future quarterly periods as a result of numerous factors aside from those associated with production volumes and product mix. .\nOther factors impacting our overall gross margin may include, the changing percentage of products sold to distributors versus directly to individual customers, varying levels of reimbursement among third-party payors and in international markets, the timing and success of new regulatory approvals and product launches, the impact of changes in our stock price on non-cash stock-based compensation, warranty and training costs, inventory obsolescence and changes in our manufacturing processes, capacity, costs or output.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses primarily consist of salary, cash-based incentive compensation, fringe benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, marketing, sales, clinical, customer support, technical services, insurance verification, regulatory affairs and other administrative functions. In particular, our sales and clinical organization consisted of approximately 70 territories as of December 31, 2018 and our operations in Canada will be supported by a direct sales force of approximately 10 field representatives. Territories in the United States are maintained by sales representatives and field clinical specialists, and supported by managed care liaisons, additional sales management and other customer support personnel. We expect to modestly increase our number of sales personnel in the near term in order to optimize the coverage of our existing territories. Other significant SG&A expenses include those incurred for product demonstration samples, commercialization activities associated with new product launches, travel, trade shows, outside legal fees, independent auditor fees, outside consultant fees, insurance premiums, facilities costs and information technology costs. Overall, we expect our SG&A expenses, including the cost of our customer support infrastructure, to increase as our customer base grows in the United States and in international geographies. Additionally, we realized a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2018 from the increase in our stock price over the past year. We expect higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be sustained in future quarters as a result of the valuation of certain employee option grants. Our SG&A expenses may also increase due to anticipated costs associated with additional compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development, or R&D, activities primarily consist of engineering and research programs associated with our products under development, as well as activities associated with our core technologies and processes. R&D expenses are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, non-cash stock-based compensation and temporary employee expenses. We also incur R&D expenses for supplies, development prototypes, outside design and testing services, depreciation, allocated facilities and information services, clinical trial costs, payments under our licensing, development and commercialization agreements and other indirect costs. We expect our R&D expenses to increase as we advance our products under development and develop new products and technologies, as well as continue to reflect a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the impact of the increase in our stock price over the past year.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense primarily consists of changes in the fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants issued in our public offering of common stock in October 2017, as well as interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated funds, or CRG. In August 2018, we fully repaid amounts due under the Term Loan Agreement. Prior to that, there was $82.7 million of outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement, which accrued interest at a coupon rate of\n11.5% per annum. As a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018, but there will be no related interest expense or costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future years. Our interest and other income also includes interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. We expect other income and expense to fluctuate from period to period due to revaluations of the outstanding Series A warrants, which expire in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nResults of

For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales were $183.9 million, which included $9.7 million from international sales that commenced in the third quarter of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included incremental net pump sales of $5.0 million as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program in place at that time.\nTotal sales increased $76.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a 102% increase in worldwide pump shipments to 34,493 in the year ended 2018, compared to 17,061 in the year ended 2017. Worldwide pump shipments were positively impacted by strong demand for our products following the August 2018 launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, the August 2017 launch of t:slim X2 with G5 integration, and the commencement of international sales in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, sales from pump-related supplies increased 66% due to the September 2017 launch of infusion set products using the t:lock connector, as well as an overall increase in our installed customer base of customers reordering supplies. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to over 100% in 2018 from 69% in the year ended 2017.\nSales to domestic distributors accounted for 78% and 75% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor. The percentage was particularly impacted in 2018 by the mid-2017 launch of the t:lock connector, which resulted in greater purchases of infusion sets by our independent distributors during the period as compared to the same period during the prior year. Sales to international distributors accounted for 100% of our total international sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2018 was $94.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $89.8 million, compared to $63.5 million of cost of sales and gross profit of $44.1 million in 2017, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nThe gross margin for 2018 was 49%, compared to 41% in 2017. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point.\nThe improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of the increase in pump shipments which have a higher gross margin than pump-related supplies, as well as per-unit cost improvements on all products from increased production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies. As a whole, other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training costs, also reflected improvement.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 22% to $105.2 million in 2018 from $86.4 million in 2017. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $18.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, including an increase of $11.6 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our growing installed customer base. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. Additionally, this included an increase of $6.8 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 41% to $29.2 million in 2018 from $20.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses. This includes a $4.1 million increase in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our product development efforts. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. There was also an increase of $3.1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2018 was $77.9 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2017. Other expense in 2018 primarily consisted of a $66.5 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2018, $7.6 million of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement, as well as a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of our Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Other expense in 2017 consisted primarily of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan Agreement was $82.7 million prior to the repayment and as of December 31, 2017. There will be no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods. Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, for which our average invested balances were significantly higher in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nSales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included the recognition of $5.0 million of pump sales originally deferred in prior periods and upgrade fees received as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales were $84.2 million, reduced by $4.3 million of deferred pump sales as a result of our Technology Upgrade Program.\nSales of insulin pumps were $71.5 million and $62.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of pump-related supplies were $35.6 million, of which $21.4 million were sales of infusion sets and $14.2 million were sales of cartridges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of pump-related supplies were $21.4 million, of which $9.7 million were sales of infusion sets and $11.7 million were sales of cartridges. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approached 100% during December, compared to 31% in 2016. Sales of accessories were not significant in either year.\nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the increase in sales was primarily driven by an increase in sales of infusion sets to our distributors, as well as an increase in the sale of pump-related supplies to our growing customer base. Pump shipments only slightly increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 17,061 from 16,938 in 2016, which we believe was the result of a number of factors including the highly competitive market, the timing of FDA approval of t:slim X2 with G5, and negative perceptions regarding our financial stability compared to that of our competitors.\nSales to distributors accounted for 75% and 74% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2017 was $63.5 million, resulting in gross profit of $44.1 million, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program. Our cost of sales in 2016 was $60.7 million, resulting in gross profit of $23.6 million in 2016, which included a reduction in gross profit of $4.6 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nThe gross margin in 2017 was 41%, compared to 28% in 2016. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point. The net reduction of gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by four percentage points.\nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of per-unit manufacturing cost improvements, including significant raw material cost reductions for pumps and overall manufacturing efficiencies for both pumps and cartridges, as well as contribution from the incremental sales of infusion sets. Other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training, also improved.\nIn addition, in 2016 we recorded a $2.8 million charge for inventory excess and obsolescence as the result of the commercialization of t:slim X2, the launch of the Technology Upgrade Program and the larger than anticipated decrease in t:slim G4 sales in the second half of the year. This inventory excess and obsolescence charge negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by three percentage points.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 4% to $86.4 million in 2017 from $82.8 million in 2016. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $3.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016, including an increase of $0.9 million in salaries and fringe benefits, as well as an increase in cash-based incentive compensation of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation of $0.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% to $20.7 million in 2017 from $18.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses of $1.6 million and $0.9 million in outside consulting expense, including clinical trial costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with supplies and other services.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2017 was $10.1 million, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. Other expense in 2017 and 2016 primarily consisted of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan Agreement were $82.7 million and $81.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In 2017, we also recorded a $1.0 million gain from the change in fair value of the common stock warrants. Other income in 2017 and 2016 was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $129.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing.\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included private placements and public offerings of equity securities, debt financing, and cash collected from product sales. Since the beginning of 2017, we completed the following financings:\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In August 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 4,035,085 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $28.50 per share.

The gross proceeds to us from this financing were approximately $16.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of 8,735,765 outstanding Series A and Series B warrants. As of December 31, 2018, there were Series A warrants to purchase 510,785 shares outstanding and there were no Series B warrants outstanding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 464,108 shares of our common stock under our at the market\u201d program, or the ATM Offering, at prices ranging from $5.64 to $10.54 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were $4.3 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The ATM Offering was terminated in December 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In March 2017, we completed a registered public offering of 1,850,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $23.1 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the development and commercialization of our products and expansion and support of our sales, marketing, clinical and customer support organizations, an increase in our R&D activities, the acquisition of intellectual property, expenditures related to increases in our manufacturing capacity and improvements to our manufacturing efficiency, overall facility expansion, and other working capital needs. Additionally, we have used cash to pay the interest expense associated with our Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance associated with the Term Loan Agreement was fully repaid in August 2018, which will result in no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods.\nWe expect our sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash flow from operations, liquidity position and cash management decisions. Our ability to raise additional financing may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including our recent and projected financial results, recent changes in and volatility of our stock price, perceptions about the dilutive impact of financing transactions, the competitive environment in our industry, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,319\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (66,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (61,173\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,739\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $66.1 million and $61.2 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe decrease in net cash used in operating activities for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily associated with a reduction in the net loss when adjusted for non-cash expenses, particularly the change in the fair value of Series A and Series B warrants, increased stock-based compensation expense, and the loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as net changes in working capital. Our operating loss included $10.8 million and $7.9 million in cash paid for interest in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Working capital changes were due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales, offset by a reduction in inventory and increases in employee related liabilities and deferred revenue. Inventory decreased to $19.9 million at December 31, 2018 from $27.0 at December 31, 2017 due to an increase in pump production and sales demand during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the timing of certain inventory receipts.\nThe increase in net cash used in operating activities for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to changes in working capital, offset by an improvement in our operating loss of $10.5 million. Our operating loss included $7.9 million and $4.4 million in cash paid for interest in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Working capital changes were due to lower cash collections from accounts receivable and a reduction in deferred revenue, offset by increases in employee-related and other liabilities and decreases in prepaid and other current assets.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used by investing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $123.6 million using the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in August of 2018, and $3.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by $35.8 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.5 million offset by $5.7 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $50.0 million offset by the net purchase of $30.6 million in short-term investments and $8.9 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of net proceeds of approximately $172.9 million from the public offerings of our common stock in February 2018 and August 2018, as well as proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of Series A and Series B warrants that were issued in the public offering of common stock in October 2017, offset by the $87.7 million repayment of our term loan and associated financing fees. Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of debt under the Term Loan Agreement in the amount of $50.0 million and $2.3 million in proceeds from participation in our employee stock plans.\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to fluctuation based on a number of factors. In particular, our cash inflows and outflows are principally impacted by the following:\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> our ability to generate sales, the timing of those sales and the collection of receivables generated from those sales from period to period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the timing and amount of any additional financings, including the exercise of warrants and proceeds from employee stock incentive plans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fluctuations in gross margins and operating margins; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> fluctuations in working capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> research and product development efforts, including clinical trial costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> payments under licensing, development and commercialization agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short-term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our particular cash uses or the timing or amount of cash used. In addition, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Any such transaction may require short-term expenditures that may impact our capital needs. If for any reason cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may in the future be required to seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock, or we may elect to borrow amounts under new credit lines or from other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, we may incur significant financing or debt service costs, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIndebtedness\nRepayment of Term Loan Agreement\nIn August 2018, we fully repaid our term loan with CRG pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement. The balance of the outstanding debt at the time of repayment was $82.7 million. The repayment included approximately $1.1 million in accrued interest and $5.0 million in associated financing fees that became due. Therefore, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2018. At the time of repayment, the remaining $5.3 million debt discount balance associated with the financing fees and certain debt issuance costs was accelerated and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $82.7 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 and a $4.1 million liability for financing fees.\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, interest was payable at our option, (i) in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum, or (ii) at a rate of 9.5% of the 11.5% per annum in cash and 2.0% of the 11.5% per annum, or the PIK Loan, to be added to the principal of the loan and subject to accruing interest. Interest-only payments were due quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year of the interest-only payment period, which would have ended on December 31, 2019. The principal balance was due in full at the end of the term of the loan, which was March 31, 2020, or the Maturity Date. We had elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum through September 30, 2015. From October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, we elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 9.5% per annum and for a rate of 2.0% per annum to be added to the principal of the loan. As a result, $2.7 million was added to the principal of the loan during that time period, collectively, the PIK Loans.\nWe entered into a series of amendments to the Term Loan Agreement in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which included the addition of a financing fee payable at the maturity of the term loans, the issuance of warrants to purchase 193,788 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $23.50 per share, or the CRG Warrant, and certain other minimum financing covenants. The CRG Warrant had a term of 10 years from the date of issuance and would have expired on March 7, 2027. The financing fee was applicable to the entire aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding, including total PIK Loans issued.\nContractual Obligations & Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\nrelated to facilities (1)(2)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Firm purchase commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The Barnes Canyon Lease provided for a tenant improvement allowance, or the TI Allowance, of up to approximately $3.4 million to be applied to non-structural improvements to the Barnes Canyon Building, which we fully utilized.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is generated primarily from sales of our insulin pumps, disposable cartridges and infusion sets to individual customers and third-party distributors that resell the product to insulin-dependent diabetes customers. We are paid directly by customers who use the products, distributors and third-party insurance payors.\nIn January 2018, we adopted the Revenue from Contracts with Customers Standard which supersedes existing revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Accordingly, subsequent to January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We elected to implement this new standard utilizing the modified retrospective method. Under this approach, we applied the new standard to all new contracts initiated on or after the effective date, and, for contracts which had remaining obligations as of the effective date, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The accounting for the significant majority of our revenues is not impacted by the new guidance. As a result, on January 1, 2018, we recorded a net reduction to accumulated deficit in the amount of $149,000, reflecting the accounting change.\nPrior to the implementation of this new standard, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, delivery had occurred and title passed, the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured.\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\nWe consider the deliverables in our product offering to be separate performance obligations. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration expected to be received, based either on the stated value in contractual arrangements or the estimated cash to be collected in non-contracted arrangements. We allocate the consideration to the individual performance obligations and recognize the consideration based on when the performance obligation is satisfied, considering whether or not this occurs at a point in time or over time.\nGenerally, insulin pumps, cartridges, infusion sets and accessories are deemed performance obligations that are satisfied upon delivery, while access to the complementary products, such as the t:connect cloud-based data management application and the Tandem Device Updater, are considered performance obligations satisfied over the four-year warranty period of the insulin pumps. There is no standalone value for these complementary products. Therefore, the Company determines their value by applying the expected cost-plus margin approach and then allocates the residual to the insulin pumps.\nProduct Returns\nWe offer a 30-day right of return to our customers from the date of shipment of any of our insulin pumps, provided a physician's confirmation of the medical reason for the return is received. Estimated allowances for sales returns recorded as a reduction in revenue are based on historical returned quantities as compared to pump shipments in those same periods of return. The return rate is then applied to the sales of the current period to establish a reserve at the end of the period. The return rates used in the reserve are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate.\nWarranty Reserve\nWe generally provide a four-year warranty on our insulin pumps to end user customers and may replace any pumps that do not function in accordance with the product specifications. Insulin pumps returned to us may be refurbished and redeployed. Additionally, we offer a six-month warranty on disposable cartridges and infusion sets. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of shipment to cost of sales. Warranty costs are estimated based on the current expected replacement product cost and expected replacement rates based on historical experience. We evaluate the reserve quarterly and make adjustments when appropriate. Changes to the actual replacement rates could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nJumpStart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act)\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2013. Accordingly, 2018 was our fifth year as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As such, we are required to obtain an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act commencing with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 In March 2017, we completed a registered public offering of 1,850,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $23.1 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years (1) - International\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales to distributors accounted for 75% and 74% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor.\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,319\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (66,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (61,173\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,739\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenue is generated primarily from sales of our insulin pumps, disposable cartridges and infusion sets to individual customers and third-party distributors that resell the product to insulin-dependent diabetes customers.

We believe we can ultimately achieve sustained profitability by driving incremental sales growth, meeting our pump renewal sales objectives, increasing gross profits from additional sales of infusion sets, maximizing manufacturing efficiencies on increased production volumes and leveraging the investments made in our sales, clinical, marketing and customer support organizations.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years (1) - U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 designation by UnitedHealthcare of one of our competitors as its preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers age seven and above, and; \n\nInvesting activities. Net cash used by investing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $123.6 million using the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in August of 2018, and $3.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by $35.8 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.5 million offset by $5.7 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $50.0 million offset by the net purchase of $30.6 million in short-term investments and $8.9 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nProducts under Development\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n</td> </tr>\nWe offer a 30-day right of return to our customers from the date of shipment of any of our insulin pumps, provided a physician's confirmation of the medical reason for the return is received. Estimated allowances for sales returns recorded as a reduction in revenue are based on historical returned quantities as compared to pump shipments in those same periods of return. The return rate is then applied to the sales of the current period to establish a reserve at the end of the period. The return rates used in the reserve are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 with G5 in select international geographies. With the exception of Canada where we intend to market with a direct sales force, we expect that most of our commercial sales outside the United States will initially be to independent distributors who will perform all sales, customer support and training in their respective territories. Historically, we have experienced consistent levels of reimbursement for our products in the United States, but the average sales price will vary in international markets based on a number of factors, such as the nature of the reimbursement environment, government regulations and the extent to which we rely on distributor relationships to provide sales, clinical and marketing support.\n \u2022 During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 464,108 shares of our common stock under our at the market\u201d program, or the ATM Offering, at prices ranging from $5.64 to $10.54 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were $4.3 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The ATM Offering was terminated in December 2017. \n \u25cf our ability to generate sales, the timing of those sales and the collection of receivables generated from those sales from period to period; \nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short-term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our particular cash uses or the timing or amount of cash used. In addition, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Any such transaction may require short-term expenditures that may impact our capital needs. If for any reason cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may in the future be required to seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock, or we may elect to borrow amounts under new credit lines or from other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, we may incur significant financing or debt service costs, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nGenerally, insulin pumps, cartridges, infusion sets and accessories are deemed performance obligations that are satisfied upon delivery, while access to the complementary products, such as the t:connect cloud-based data management application and the Tandem Device Updater, are considered performance obligations satisfied over the four-year warranty period of the insulin pumps. There is no standalone value for these complementary products. Therefore, the Company determines their value by applying the expected cost-plus margin approach and then allocates the residual to the insulin pumps.\nIn January 2018, we adopted the Revenue from Contracts with Customers Standard which supersedes existing revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Accordingly, subsequent to January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We elected to implement this new standard utilizing the modified retrospective method. Under this approach, we applied the new standard to all new contracts initiated on or after the effective date, and, for contracts which had remaining obligations as of the effective date, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The accounting for the significant majority of our revenues is not impacted by the new guidance. As a result, on January 1, 2018, we recorded a net reduction to accumulated deficit in the amount of $149,000, reflecting the accounting change.\nIn addition, our quarterly sales have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, substantially in the periods surrounding anticipated and actual regulatory approvals and commercial launches of new products by us or our competitors. For instance, customers may defer a purchasing decision if they believe that a new product may be launched in the future. Additionally, upon the announcement of FDA approval or commercial launch of a new product, either by us or one of our competitors, potential new customers may reconsider their purchasing decision or take additional time to consider the anticipated or new approval or product launch in their purchasing decision. However, we are not able to quantify the extent of the impact of these or similar events on future purchasing decisions.\n\nOther factors impacting our overall gross margin may include, the changing percentage of products sold to distributors versus directly to individual customers, varying levels of reimbursement among third-party payors and in international markets, the timing and success of new regulatory approvals and product launches, the impact of changes in our stock price on non-cash stock-based compensation, warranty and training costs, inventory obsolescence and changes in our manufacturing processes, capacity, costs or output.\nWe manufacture our pumps and disposable cartridges at our manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. Infusion sets and pump accessories are manufactured by third-party suppliers. Cost of sales includes raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses, product training costs, reserves for expected warranty costs, freight, scrap and inventory excess and obsolescence. Manufacturing overhead expenses include expenses relating to quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment, information technology and operations supervision and management. We anticipate that our cost of sales will continue to increase as our products gain broader market acceptance and our product sales increase.\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2013. Accordingly, 2018 was our fifth year as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As such, we are required to obtain an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act commencing with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nThe increase in net cash used in operating activities for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to changes in working capital, offset by an improvement in our operating loss of $10.5 million. Our operating loss included $7.9 million and $4.4 million in cash paid for interest in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Working capital changes were due to lower cash collections from accounts receivable and a reduction in deferred revenue, offset by increases in employee-related and other liabilities and decreases in prepaid and other current assets.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2018 was $77.9 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2017. Other expense in 2018 primarily consisted of a $66.5 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2018, $7.6 million of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement, as well as a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of our Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Other expense in 2017 consisted primarily of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan Agreement was $82.7 million prior to the repayment and as of December 31, 2017. There will be no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods. Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, for which our average invested balances were significantly higher in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of net proceeds of approximately $172.9 million from the public offerings of our common stock in February 2018 and August 2018, as well as proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of Series A and Series B warrants that were issued in the public offering of common stock in October 2017, offset by the $87.7 million repayment of our term loan and associated financing fees. Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of debt under the Term Loan Agreement in the amount of $50.0 million and $2.3 million in proceeds from participation in our employee stock plans.\nPump Shipments\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, interest was payable at our option, (i) in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum, or (ii) at a rate of 9.5% of the 11.5% per annum in cash and 2.0% of the 11.5% per annum, or the PIK Loan, to be added to the principal of the loan and subject to accruing interest. Interest-only payments were due quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year of the interest-only payment period, which would have ended on December 31, 2019. The principal balance was due in full at the end of the term of the loan, which was March 31, 2020, or the Maturity Date. We had elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum through September 30, 2015. From October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, we elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 9.5% per annum and for a rate of 2.0% per annum to be added to the principal of the loan. As a result, $2.7 million was added to the principal of the loan during that time period, collectively, the PIK Loans.\n \u2022 In October 2017, we completed a registered public offering of our common stock, pursuant to which we sold 4,630,000 shares of our common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to 4,630,000 shares of our common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 4,630,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $3.50 per share and accompanying warrants. The gross proceeds to us from this financing were approximately $16.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of 8,735,765 outstanding Series A and Series B warrants. As of December 31, 2018, there were Series A warrants to purchase 510,785 shares outstanding and there were no Series B warrants outstanding. \nOur historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the development and commercialization of our products and expansion and support of our sales, marketing, clinical and customer support organizations, an increase in our R&D activities, the acquisition of intellectual property, expenditures related to increases in our manufacturing capacity and improvements to our manufacturing efficiency, overall facility expansion, and other working capital needs. Additionally, we have used cash to pay the interest expense associated with our Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance associated with the Term Loan Agreement was fully repaid in August 2018, which will result in no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions\nThe gross margin for 2018 was 49%, compared to 41% in 2017. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2017 was $63.5 million, resulting in gross profit of $44.1 million, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program. Our cost of sales in 2016 was $60.7 million, resulting in gross profit of $23.6 million in 2016, which included a reduction in gross profit of $4.6 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nSales\nWarranty Reserve\nOverview\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% to $20.7 million in 2017 from $18.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses of $1.6 million and $0.9 million in outside consulting expense, including clinical trial costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with supplies and other services.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated sales were $183.9 million, $107.6 million, and $84.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net loss was $122.6 million, $73.0 million, and $83.4 million, respectively. Worldwide pump sales accounted for 67%, 66%, and 74% of our total sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, while pump-related supplies and accessories accounted for the remainder in each year. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $600.1 million and $477.6 million, respectively. This included $147.4 million and $56.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation charges and non-cash changes in the fair value of common stock warrants as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn particular, we believe the following specific trends and factors have impacted, and could continue to materially impact our financial results going forward:\nDomestically, we began commercial sales of our first insulin pump product, t:slim, in August 2012 and subsequently commercialized t:flex in May 2015, t:slim G4 in September 2015, t:slim X2 in October 2016, t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration, or t:slim X2 with G5, in September of 2017 and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in August 2018. The Basal-IQ technology is our first-generation Automated Insulin Delivery, or AID, algorithm. This system uses Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor values to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. In the second quarter of 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, also created a new interoperability designation for integrated continuous glucose monitoring, or iCGM, devices. The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was the first insulin pump to receive approval for iCGM compatibility, which we expect will streamline the regulatory pathway for integration with future iCGM products as they are approved by the FDA. More recently, in early 2019 the FDA classified our t:slim X2 as the first insulin pump in a new device category referred to as Alternative Controller Enabled infusion pumps, or ACE pumps. We expect this new classification of the t:slim X2 will provide us with more flexibility as we make improvements to current products, create new products and collaborate with third-parties in the development of future AID systems. Interoperability with iCGM and other compatible devices will still require development effort and business agreements; however, the regulatory process can be lengthy and unpredictable, so we believe the FDA's designation of iCGM products and ACE pumps will, collectively, reduce the overall timeline to commercialize interoperable devices.\nIn the United States, we have rapidly increased sales since our commercial launch by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing organization, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. More recently, our sales have also rapidly increased following the scaled launch of t:slim X2 in geographies outside the United States. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market both domestically and outside of the United States. We also believe we are well positioned to address consumers' needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers access to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the FDA, and as we develop the capability to offer the Tandem Device Updater outside the United States. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, we are able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In the United States, we are able to leverage a single sales, marketing, and clinical organization, as well as our domestic customer support services. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and customer support infrastructure, both of which benefit from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we have contracted with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform.\n \u2022 anticipated new product launches; \n \u2022 opportunity to attract Animas customers, following the announcement by Johnson & Johnson that it discontinued the operations of Animas and will discontinue availability of pump supplies in late 2019; \nOverall, we have experienced considerable sales growth since the commercial launch of our first product in the third quarter of 2012, while incurring operating losses since our inception. Our operating results have historically fluctuated on a quarterly or annual basis, particularly in periods surrounding anticipated regulatory approvals, and the commercial launch of products by us and our competitors.\nTotal sales increased $76.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a 102% increase in worldwide pump shipments to 34,493 in the year ended 2018, compared to 17,061 in the year ended 2017. Worldwide pump shipments were positively impacted by strong demand for our products following the August 2018 launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, the August 2017 launch of t:slim X2 with G5 integration, and the commencement of international sales in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, sales from pump-related supplies increased 66% due to the September 2017 launch of infusion set products using the t:lock connector, as well as an overall increase in our installed customer base of customers reordering supplies. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to over 100% in 2018 from 69% in the year ended 2017.\n \u25cf fluctuations in gross margins and operating margins; and \nIn addition, in 2016 we recorded a $2.8 million charge for inventory excess and obsolescence as the result of the commercialization of t:slim X2, the launch of the Technology Upgrade Program and the larger than anticipated decrease in t:slim G4 sales in the second half of the year. This inventory excess and obsolescence charge negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by three percentage points.\nWe offer products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We commenced commercial sales of our original t:slim insulin pump platform in the United States in the third quarter of 2012 and continued to launch various iterations of that platform the following years. In October 2016, we began shipping our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 insulin pump. The t:slim X2 hardware platform, which includes remote software update capabilities, now represents 100% of our new pump shipments. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018 we discontinued new sales of all prior platform versions. Our products also include disposable cartridges and infusion sets. In addition, we offer accessories including protective cases, belt clips, and power adapters, although such sales are not significant.\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included private placements and public offerings of equity securities, debt financing, and cash collected from product sales. Since the beginning of 2017, we completed the following financings:\n (1) The Barnes Canyon Lease provided for a tenant improvement allowance, or the TI Allowance, of up to approximately $3.4 million to be applied to non-structural improvements to the Barnes Canyon Building, which we fully utilized. The amounts funded by the landlord are subject to an interest accrual at a rate of 8.0% per annum and must be repaid in full during the base term in monthly installments (TI Rent), paid concurrently with the base rent. TI Rent is not included in the table above. TI Rent is expected to be $0.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2023. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include new AID systems, a next-generation hardware platform, and connected (mobile) health offerings. We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionalities that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2017 was $10.1 million, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. Other expense in 2017 and 2016 primarily consisted of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan Agreement were $82.7 million and $81.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In 2017, we also recorded a $1.0 million gain from the change in fair value of the common stock warrants. Other income in 2017 and 2016 was not significant.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and are subject to the safe harbor\u201d created by these sections.

Insulin pumps returned to us may be refurbished and redeployed. Additionally, we offer a six-month warranty on disposable cartridges and infusion sets. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of shipment to cost of sales. Warranty costs are estimated based on the current expected replacement product cost and expected replacement rates based on historical experience. We evaluate the reserve quarterly and make adjustments when appropriate. Changes to the actual replacement rates could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.\n \u2022 anticipated and actual regulatory approvals of our products and competitive products. \n \u25cf research and product development efforts, including clinical trial costs; \n \u2022 changes in the competitive landscape, including as a result of companies entering or exiting the diabetes therapy market; \n \u2022 t:slim X2 with Control IQ Technology: Our second-generation AID system is expected to integrate the t:slim X2 with the technology that we licensed from TypeZero and Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor. The iCGM designation for the system also provides the opportunity for integration development efforts with future iCGM sensors that may become available in the market. With our implementation of TypeZero's inControl AID algorithms, our product is intended to both increase and decrease basal insulin based on a user's predicted blood glucose levels from a compatible iCGM sensor, as well as deliver automated correction boluses. In conjunction with Dexcom and TypeZero, which was acquired by Dexcom in August 2018, we have integrated our technologies into the U.S. portion of the Clinical Acceptance of the Artificial Pancreas, or DCLP3, portion of the International Diabetes Closed Loop, or the IDCL, trial. Enrollment for the 6-month study was completed in October 2018. Our t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology has also been evaluated in several early pediatric studies and we intend to support a pivotal study among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes that will commence in the first half of 2019. Our goal is to commence commercial sales of the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology in the United States in the second half of 2019, followed by an international launch in 2020. \nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the increase in sales was primarily driven by an increase in sales of infusion sets to our distributors, as well as an increase in the sale of pump-related supplies to our growing customer base. Pump shipments only slightly increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 17,061 from 16,938 in 2016, which we believe was the result of a number of factors including the highly competitive market, the timing of FDA approval of t:slim X2 with G5, and negative perceptions regarding our financial stability compared to that of our competitors.\nContractual Obligations & Commitments\nResults of Operations\nWe primarily sell our products through national and regional distributors in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. These distributors are generally providers of medical equipment and supplies to individuals with diabetes. Our primary end customers are people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Similar to other durable medical equipment, the primary payor is generally a third-party insurance carrier and the customer is usually responsible for any medical insurance plan copay or coinsurance requirements. We believe our existing sales, clinical, and marketing infrastructure will allow us to continue to increase sales by allowing us to promote our products to a greater number of potential customers, caregivers and healthcare providers.\nSubsequent Events\nThe decrease in net cash used in operating activities for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily associated with a reduction in the net loss when adjusted for non-cash expenses, particularly the change in the fair value of Series A and Series B warrants, increased stock-based compensation expense, and the loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as net changes in working capital. Our operating loss included $10.8 million and $7.9 million in cash paid for interest in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Working capital changes were due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales, offset by a reduction in inventory and increases in employee related liabilities and deferred revenue. Inventory decreased to $19.9 million at December 31, 2018 from $27.0 at December 31, 2017 due to an increase in pump production and sales demand during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the timing of certain inventory receipts.\nWe expect our sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash flow from operations, liquidity position and cash management decisions. Our ability to raise additional financing may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including our recent and projected financial results, recent changes in and volatility of our stock price, perceptions about the dilutive impact of financing transactions, the competitive environment in our industry, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment.\n \u2022 market acceptance of our products and competitive products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers; \nIn August 2018, we fully repaid our term loan with CRG pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement. The balance of the outstanding debt at the time of repayment was $82.7 million. The repayment included approximately $1.1 million in accrued interest and $5.0 million in associated financing fees that became due. Therefore, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2018. At the time of repayment, the remaining $5.3 million debt discount balance associated with the financing fees and certain debt issuance costs was accelerated and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $82.7 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 and a $4.1 million liability for financing fees.\nSales to domestic distributors accounted for 78% and 75% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor. The percentage was particularly impacted in 2018 by the mid-2017 launch of the t:lock connector, which resulted in greater purchases of infusion sets by our independent distributors during the period as compared to the same period during the prior year. Sales to international distributors accounted for 100% of our total international sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we shipped 34,493 insulin pumps worldwide compared to 17,061 insulin pumps shipped in 2017. In the United States we have shipped more than 79,000 pumps within the four-year period ended December 31, 2018. Pump shipments in the United States by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nWe are a medical device company with an innovative approach to the design, development and commercialization of products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our unique consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing, sales and support activities exclusively focus on our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim X2, and our complementary product offerings. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is based on our proprietary technology platform and is the smallest durable insulin pump available. It is the only pump currently available in the United States that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. By delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support, we aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and their healthcare providers.\nWe believe that our business condition and financial results, as well as the decision-making process of our customers, has been and will continue to be impacted by a number of general trends and factors, including the following:\nIndebtedness\nTrends Impacting Financial Results\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of per-unit manufacturing cost improvements, including significant raw material cost reductions for pumps and overall manufacturing efficiencies for both pumps and cartridges, as well as contribution from the incremental sales of infusion sets. Other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training, also improved.\n \u25cf acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets; and \nWe entered into a series of amendments to the Term Loan Agreement in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which included the addition of a financing fee payable at the maturity of the term loans, the issuance of warrants to purchase 193,788 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $23.50 per share, or the CRG Warrant, and certain other minimum financing covenants. The CRG Warrant had a term of 10 years from the date of issuance and would have expired on March 7, 2027. The financing fee was applicable to the entire aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding, including total PIK Loans issued.\nTechnology Upgrade Program\n \u2022 expansion in select international geographies, which began in the third quarter of 2018. \nPrior to the implementation of this new standard, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, delivery had occurred and title passed, the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured.\nIn general, in the United States we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, product shipments being weighted heavily towards the second half of the year, with the highest percentage of product shipments expected in the fourth quarter of the year due to the nature of the reimbursement environment. Consistent with our historical seasonality, we also expect domestic product shipments from the fourth quarter to the following first quarter to decrease significantly. Internationally, we do not expect this same impact from seasonality. However, the opportunity for the transition of former Animas customers in 2019 may also impact our quarterly sales trends worldwide.\n (1) The pump units shipped do not reflect returns or exchanges of pump products that occur in the ordinary course of business. \nAt December 31, 2018, we had $129.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing.\nSales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included the recognition of $5.0 million of pump sales originally deferred in prior periods and upgrade fees received as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales were $84.2 million, reduced by $4.3 million of deferred pump sales as a result of our Technology Upgrade Program.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nJumpStart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act)\nOther income and expense primarily consists of changes in the fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants issued in our public offering of common stock in October 2017, as well as interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated funds, or CRG. In August 2018, we fully repaid amounts due under the Term Loan Agreement. Prior to that, there was $82.7 million of outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement, which accrued interest at a coupon rate of\n</table>\n \u2022 continued increase in demand following the commercial launch of t:slim X2 and the demonstrated success of our Tandem Device Updater, which we expect will positively impact our sales; \nCost of Sales\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe have commercially launched six insulin pumps in the United States since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Three of these pumps have featured continuous glucose monitoring technology, or CGM. In the past four years, we have shipped approximately 84,000 pumps, over 4,000 of which were in international markets, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer base on the typical four-year reimbursement cycle.\nThe improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of the increase in pump shipments which have a higher gross margin than pump-related supplies, as well as per-unit cost improvements on all products from increased production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies. As a whole, other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training costs, also reflected improvement.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Selected Financial Data\u201d in Part II, Item 6 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, which statements are subject to considerable risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nIn the United States, our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps' software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater provides our in-warranty domestic customers potential access to new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. The first use of our Tandem Device Updater was for our deployment of the latest t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. Since that time, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers in the United States two significant software updates: (i) integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system in September 2017; and (ii) an upgrade to our new Basal-IQ technology and integration with Dexcom's G6 CGM in August 2018. Our Tandem Device Updater positions us to bring future innovations and AID algorithms to t:slim X2 customers, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle. Though we have not utilized our Tandem Device Updater to perform software updates for devices outside the United States, we are currently developing that capability, and intend to do so in the future.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 Connected (Mobile) Health Offerings: We are currently developing a mobile application that is being designed to utilize the capability of the Bluetooth radio to wirelessly upload pump data to t:connect, receive notification of pump alerts and alarms, integrate other health-related information from third party sources, and support future pump-control capabilities for our products under development. Subject to FDA approval, we intend to launch the first generation of our mobile application with a subset of these features in the United States in 2019. \nSales. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales were $183.9 million, which included $9.7 million from international sales that commenced in the third quarter of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included incremental net pump sales of $5.0 million as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program in place at that time.\n \u2022 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors, and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors; \n \u2022 seasonality in the United States associated with annual insurance deductibles and coinsurance requirements associated with the medical insurance plans utilized by our customers and the customers of our distributors; \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 22% to $105.2 million in 2018 from $86.4 million in 2017. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $18.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, including an increase of $11.6 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our growing installed customer base. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. Additionally, this included an increase of $6.8 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\n \u2022 In August 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 4,035,085 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $28.50 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \nSelling, General and Administrative\nWe expect our overall gross margin percentage, which for any given period is calculated as sales less cost of sales divided by sales, to improve over the long-term, as our sales increase and our overhead costs are spread over larger production volumes. We expect we will be able to leverage our manufacturing cost structure across our products that utilize the same proprietary technology platform and manufacturing infrastructure, and will be able to further reduce costs with increased automation, process improvements and raw materials cost reductions. Pumps have, and are expected to continue to have, a higher gross margin than our pump-related supplies. Therefore, the percentage of pump sales relative to total sales will have a significant impact on gross margin. We also expect our warranty costs per unit to decrease as we release product features and functionality utilizing the Tandem Device Updater. However, our overall gross margin may fluctuate in future quarterly periods as a result of numerous factors aside from those associated with production volumes and product mix. .\n \u2022 In February 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 34,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $69.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \n \u25cf payments under licensing, development and commercialization agreements. \nResearch and Development\n \u2022 the magnitude and timing of any changes to our facilities, manufacturing operations and other infrastructure; and \nIn January 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for 25,332 square feet of additional general administrative office space located at 10935 Vista Sorrento Parkway, San Diego, California. Subject to limited exceptions, the initial lease term is expected to commence on the later of (i) March 1, 2019, or (ii) the date on which the landlord substantially completes certain specified work related to tenant improvements, such date, the Commencement Date, and will expire 42 months from the first day of the first full month following the Commencement Date. We also have a one-time option to extend the term of the lease for a period of five years by delivering prior written notice to the landlord in accordance with the terms of the lease.\n \u2022 increased opportunity to achieve customer renewals as customers become eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump at the end of the typical four-year reimbursement cycle; \n \u25cf support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products; \nOur research and development, or R&D, activities primarily consist of engineering and research programs associated with our products under development, as well as activities associated with our core technologies and processes. R&D expenses are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, non-cash stock-based compensation and temporary employee expenses. We also incur R&D expenses for supplies, development prototypes, outside design and testing services, depreciation, allocated facilities and information services, clinical trial costs, payments under our licensing, development and commercialization agreements and other indirect costs. We expect our R&D expenses to increase as we advance our products under development and develop new products and technologies, as well as continue to reflect a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the impact of the increase in our stock price over the past year.\nOur selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses primarily consist of salary, cash-based incentive compensation, fringe benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, marketing, sales, clinical, customer support, technical services, insurance verification, regulatory affairs and other administrative functions. In particular, our sales and clinical organization consisted of approximately 70 territories as of December 31, 2018 and our operations in Canada will be supported by a direct sales force of approximately 10 field representatives. Territories in the United States are maintained by sales representatives and field clinical specialists, and supported by managed care liaisons, additional sales management and other customer support personnel. We expect to modestly increase our number of sales personnel in the near term in order to optimize the coverage of our existing territories. Other significant SG&A expenses include those incurred for product demonstration samples, commercialization activities associated with new product launches, travel, trade shows, outside legal fees, independent auditor fees, outside consultant fees, insurance premiums, facilities costs and information technology costs. Overall, we expect our SG&A expenses, including the cost of our customer support infrastructure, to increase as our customer base grows in the United States and in international geographies. Additionally, we realized a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2018 from the increase in our stock price over the past year. We expect higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be sustained in future quarters as a result of the valuation of certain employee option grants. Our SG&A expenses may also increase due to anticipated costs associated with additional compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $66.1 million and $61.2 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn the second half of 2018, we began selling the t:slim X2 with G5, in select geographies outside the United States, including Canada. We have discontinued sales of our original t:slim, t:flex and t:slim G4 pumps, and our t:slim X2 hardware platform now represents 100% of new pump shipments. However, we continue to provide ongoing service and support for our earlier products.\nPump shipments to international customers by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nItem 7.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2018 was $94.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $89.8 million, compared to $63.5 million of cost of sales and gross profit of $44.1 million in 2017, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\nSince inception, we have derived nearly all of our sales from the shipment of insulin pumps and associated supplies in the United States. Starting in the third quarter of 2018, we commenced sales of our t:slim X2 insulin pump in select international geographies. We consider the number of units shipped per quarter to be an important metric for managing our business.\n\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to fluctuation based on a number of factors. In particular, our cash inflows and outflows are principally impacted by the following:\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 41% to $29.2 million in 2018 from $20.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses. This includes a $4.1 million increase in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our product development efforts. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. There was also an increase of $3.1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 4% to $86.4 million in 2017 from $82.8 million in 2016. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $3.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016, including an increase of $0.9 million in salaries and fringe benefits, as well as an increase in cash-based incentive compensation of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation of $0.7 million.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nFor additional information, see the section of this Annual Report under the caption Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nThe gross margin in 2017 was 41%, compared to 28% in 2016. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point. The net reduction of gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by four percentage points.\n11.5% per annum. As a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018, but there will be no related interest expense or costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future years. Our interest and other income also includes interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. We expect other income and expense to fluctuate from period to period due to revaluations of the outstanding Series A warrants, which expire in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n \u2022 the timing of the commercialization of new products by us or our competitors; \n \u2022 the buying patterns of our distributors and other customers; \n (3) Includes purchase orders that are cancellable under the standard terms of our purchase order agreements. In certain cases, cancelation of outstanding purchase commitments may require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancelation. \nSales of insulin pumps were $71.5 million and $62.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of pump-related supplies were $35.6 million, of which $21.4 million were sales of infusion sets and $14.2 million were sales of cartridges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of pump-related supplies were $21.4 million, of which $9.7 million were sales of infusion sets and $11.7 million were sales of cartridges. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approached 100% during December, compared to 31% in 2016. Sales of accessories were not significant in either year.\n (2) 2016 and 2017 U.S. shipments do not include approximately 3,300 trade-ins fulfilled under the Technology Upgrade Program (discussed below) related to our commercial launch of t:slim X2. \nProduct Returns\n \u2022 t:sport Insulin Delivery System: Expected to be half the size of our t:slim X2 pump, the t:sport pump is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump. We anticipate that t:sport will feature a 200-unit cartridge, an on-pump bolus button, a rechargeable battery, an AID algorithm, and a Bluetooth radio. t:sport is being designed for use with leading U-100 insulins, and we are evaluating the use of insulin concentrates to provide people with greater insulin needs. t:sport will utilize a pumping mechanism that differs from our current Micro-Delivery technology. \n\n \u2022 timing of holidays and summer vacations which vary by geography; \nWe consider the deliverables in our product offering to be separate performance obligations. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration expected to be received, based either on the stated value in contractual arrangements or the estimated cash to be collected in non-contracted arrangements. We allocate the consideration to the individual performance obligations and recognize the consideration based on when the performance obligation is satisfied, considering whether or not this occurs at a point in time or over time.\nOur insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to selling insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user's body.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017, we offered a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure, as a pathway for certain existing customers to obtain the t:slim X2. Due to the high degree of accounting complexity, the program created unpredictable financial results under U.S. GAAP for the duration of the program. The accounting treatment for the program required us to defer up to 100% of sales at the time of pump shipment and recognize them in a subsequent period, either when the upgrade was fulfilled or at the expiration of the program. We recognized the deferred amount of sales and cost of sales at the earlier of when the obligations under the program were satisfied or upon the expiration of the program. If a customer elected to participate in the program, we recognized any upgrade fees that we received and the associated costs at the time of fulfilling the given obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incremental net sales of $5.0 million with a corresponding increase of $3.1 million in gross profit as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a deferral of sales of $4.3 million and a net decrease in gross profit of $4.6 million as a result of the program. The program expired on September 30, 2017 and, therefore, has no impact on our 2018 financial results.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 In March 2017, we completed a registered public offering of 1,850,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $23.1 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \nSales to distributors accounted for 75% and 74% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor.\nOur revenue is generated primarily from sales of our insulin pumps, disposable cartridges and infusion sets to individual customers and third-party distributors that resell the product to insulin-dependent diabetes customers. We are paid directly by customers who use the products, distributors and third-party insurance payors.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n (2) The above table does not include amounts due under the lease of additional administrative office space located at 10935 Vista Sorrento Parkway, San Diego, California, which we entered into in January 2019. Minimum annual lease payments under the new lease will be approximately $0.4 million in 2019, $1.1 million in 2020, $1.2 million in 2021, and $0.8 million in 2022. The Company will also have a one-time option to extend the term of the lease for a period of five years with prior written notice in accordance with the terms of the lease. \nRepayment of Term Loan Agreement\nOur current products under development include:\nIn addition to working to achieve our sales growth expectations, we intend to continue to leverage our infrastructure investments to realize additional manufacturing, sales, marketing and administration cost efficiencies to improve our operating margins, including costs associated with our international launch plans. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we achieved profitability for the first time. However, this may not be sustained in the near term. We believe we can ultimately achieve sustained profitability by driving incremental sales growth, meeting our pump renewal sales objectives, increasing gross profits from additional sales of infusion sets, maximizing manufacturing efficiencies on increased production volumes and leveraging the investments made in our sales, clinical, marketing and customer support organizations.\n \u2022 designation by UnitedHealthcare of one of our competitors as its preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers age seven and above, and; \n\nInvesting activities. Net cash used by investing activities was $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $123.6 million using the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in August of 2018, and $3.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by $35.8 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.5 million offset by $5.7 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments of $50.0 million offset by the net purchase of $30.6 million in short-term investments and $8.9 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nProducts under Development\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n</td> </tr>\nWe offer a 30-day right of return to our customers from the date of shipment of any of our insulin pumps, provided a physician's confirmation of the medical reason for the return is received. Estimated allowances for sales returns recorded as a reduction in revenue are based on historical returned quantities as compared to pump shipments in those same periods of return. The return rate is then applied to the sales of the current period to establish a reserve at the end of the period. The return rates used in the reserve are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 with G5 in select international geographies. With the exception of Canada where we intend to market with a direct sales force, we expect that most of our commercial sales outside the United States will initially be to independent distributors who will perform all sales, customer support and training in their respective territories. Historically, we have experienced consistent levels of reimbursement for our products in the United States, but the average sales price will vary in international markets based on a number of factors, such as the nature of the reimbursement environment, government regulations and the extent to which we rely on distributor relationships to provide sales, clinical and marketing support.\n \u2022 During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 464,108 shares of our common stock under our at the market\u201d program, or the ATM Offering, at prices ranging from $5.64 to $10.54 per share. The gross proceeds to us from the offering were $4.3 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The ATM Offering was terminated in December 2017. \n \u25cf our ability to generate sales, the timing of those sales and the collection of receivables generated from those sales from period to period; \nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short-term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our particular cash uses or the timing or amount of cash used. In addition, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Any such transaction may require short-term expenditures that may impact our capital needs. If for any reason cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may in the future be required to seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock, or we may elect to borrow amounts under new credit lines or from other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, we may incur significant financing or debt service costs, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nGenerally, insulin pumps, cartridges, infusion sets and accessories are deemed performance obligations that are satisfied upon delivery, while access to the complementary products, such as the t:connect cloud-based data management application and the Tandem Device Updater, are considered performance obligations satisfied over the four-year warranty period of the insulin pumps. There is no standalone value for these complementary products. Therefore, the Company determines their value by applying the expected cost-plus margin approach and then allocates the residual to the insulin pumps.\nIn January 2018, we adopted the Revenue from Contracts with Customers Standard which supersedes existing revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Accordingly, subsequent to January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We elected to implement this new standard utilizing the modified retrospective method. Under this approach, we applied the new standard to all new contracts initiated on or after the effective date, and, for contracts which had remaining obligations as of the effective date, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The accounting for the significant majority of our revenues is not impacted by the new guidance. As a result, on January 1, 2018, we recorded a net reduction to accumulated deficit in the amount of $149,000, reflecting the accounting change.\nIn addition, our quarterly sales have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, substantially in the periods surrounding anticipated and actual regulatory approvals and commercial launches of new products by us or our competitors. For instance, customers may defer a purchasing decision if they believe that a new product may be launched in the future. Additionally, upon the announcement of FDA approval or commercial launch of a new product, either by us or one of our competitors, potential new customers may reconsider their purchasing decision or take additional time to consider the anticipated or new approval or product launch in their purchasing decision. However, we are not able to quantify the extent of the impact of these or similar events on future purchasing decisions.\n\nOther factors impacting our overall gross margin may include, the changing percentage of products sold to distributors versus directly to individual customers, varying levels of reimbursement among third-party payors and in international markets, the timing and success of new regulatory approvals and product launches, the impact of changes in our stock price on non-cash stock-based compensation, warranty and training costs, inventory obsolescence and changes in our manufacturing processes, capacity, costs or output.\nWe manufacture our pumps and disposable cartridges at our manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. Infusion sets and pump accessories are manufactured by third-party suppliers. Cost of sales includes raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses, product training costs, reserves for expected warranty costs, freight, scrap and inventory excess and obsolescence. Manufacturing overhead expenses include expenses relating to quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment, information technology and operations supervision and management. We anticipate that our cost of sales will continue to increase as our products gain broader market acceptance and our product sales increase.\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2013. Accordingly, 2018 was our fifth year as an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As such, we are required to obtain an audit of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act commencing with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nThe increase in net cash used in operating activities for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to changes in working capital, offset by an improvement in our operating loss of $10.5 million. Our operating loss included $7.9 million and $4.4 million in cash paid for interest in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Working capital changes were due to lower cash collections from accounts receivable and a reduction in deferred revenue, offset by increases in employee-related and other liabilities and decreases in prepaid and other current assets.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2018 was $77.9 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2017. Other expense in 2018 primarily consisted of a $66.5 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2018, $7.6 million of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement, as well as a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of our Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Other expense in 2017 consisted primarily of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan Agreement was $82.7 million prior to the repayment and as of December 31, 2017. There will be no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods. Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, for which our average invested balances were significantly higher in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of net proceeds of approximately $172.9 million from the public offerings of our common stock in February 2018 and August 2018, as well as proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of Series A and Series B warrants that were issued in the public offering of common stock in October 2017, offset by the $87.7 million repayment of our term loan and associated financing fees. Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of debt under the Term Loan Agreement in the amount of $50.0 million and $2.3 million in proceeds from participation in our employee stock plans.\nPump Shipments\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, interest was payable at our option, (i) in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum, or (ii) at a rate of 9.5% of the 11.5% per annum in cash and 2.0% of the 11.5% per annum, or the PIK Loan, to be added to the principal of the loan and subject to accruing interest. Interest-only payments were due quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year of the interest-only payment period, which would have ended on December 31, 2019. The principal balance was due in full at the end of the term of the loan, which was March 31, 2020, or the Maturity Date. We had elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 11.5% per annum through September 30, 2015. From October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, we elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 9.5% per annum and for a rate of 2.0% per annum to be added to the principal of the loan. As a result, $2.7 million was added to the principal of the loan during that time period, collectively, the PIK Loans.\n \u2022 In October 2017, we completed a registered public offering of our common stock, pursuant to which we sold 4,630,000 shares of our common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to 4,630,000 shares of our common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 4,630,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $3.50 per share and accompanying warrants. The gross proceeds to us from this financing were approximately $16.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of 8,735,765 outstanding Series A and Series B warrants. As of December 31, 2018, there were Series A warrants to purchase 510,785 shares outstanding and there were no Series B warrants outstanding. \nOur historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the development and commercialization of our products and expansion and support of our sales, marketing, clinical and customer support organizations, an increase in our R&D activities, the acquisition of intellectual property, expenditures related to increases in our manufacturing capacity and improvements to our manufacturing efficiency, overall facility expansion, and other working capital needs. Additionally, we have used cash to pay the interest expense associated with our Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance associated with the Term Loan Agreement was fully repaid in August 2018, which will result in no interest expense or other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions\nThe gross margin for 2018 was 49%, compared to 41% in 2017. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2017 was $63.5 million, resulting in gross profit of $44.1 million, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program. Our cost of sales in 2016 was $60.7 million, resulting in gross profit of $23.6 million in 2016, which included a reduction in gross profit of $4.6 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nSales\nWarranty Reserve\nOverview\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% to $20.7 million in 2017 from $18.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses of $1.6 million and $0.9 million in outside consulting expense, including clinical trial costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with supplies and other services.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated sales were $183.9 million, $107.6 million, and $84.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net loss was $122.6 million, $73.0 million, and $83.4 million, respectively. Worldwide pump sales accounted for 67%, 66%, and 74% of our total sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, while pump-related supplies and accessories accounted for the remainder in each year. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $600.1 million and $477.6 million, respectively. This included $147.4 million and $56.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation charges and non-cash changes in the fair value of common stock warrants as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn particular, we believe the following specific trends and factors have impacted, and could continue to materially impact our financial results going forward:\nDomestically, we began commercial sales of our first insulin pump product, t:slim, in August 2012 and subsequently commercialized t:flex in May 2015, t:slim G4 in September 2015, t:slim X2 in October 2016, t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration, or t:slim X2 with G5, in September of 2017 and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in August 2018. The Basal-IQ technology is our first-generation Automated Insulin Delivery, or AID, algorithm. This system uses Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor values to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. In the second quarter of 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, also created a new interoperability designation for integrated continuous glucose monitoring, or iCGM, devices. The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was the first insulin pump to receive approval for iCGM compatibility, which we expect will streamline the regulatory pathway for integration with future iCGM products as they are approved by the FDA. More recently, in early 2019 the FDA classified our t:slim X2 as the first insulin pump in a new device category referred to as Alternative Controller Enabled infusion pumps, or ACE pumps. We expect this new classification of the t:slim X2 will provide us with more flexibility as we make improvements to current products, create new products and collaborate with third-parties in the development of future AID systems. Interoperability with iCGM and other compatible devices will still require development effort and business agreements; however, the regulatory process can be lengthy and unpredictable, so we believe the FDA's designation of iCGM products and ACE pumps will, collectively, reduce the overall timeline to commercialize interoperable devices.\nIn the United States, we have rapidly increased sales since our commercial launch by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing organization, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. More recently, our sales have also rapidly increased following the scaled launch of t:slim X2 in geographies outside the United States. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market both domestically and outside of the United States. We also believe we are well positioned to address consumers' needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers access to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the FDA, and as we develop the capability to offer the Tandem Device Updater outside the United States. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, we are able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In the United States, we are able to leverage a single sales, marketing, and clinical organization, as well as our domestic customer support services. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and customer support infrastructure, both of which benefit from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we have contracted with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform.\n \u2022 anticipated new product launches; \n \u2022 opportunity to attract Animas customers, following the announcement by Johnson & Johnson that it discontinued the operations of Animas and will discontinue availability of pump supplies in late 2019; \nOverall, we have experienced considerable sales growth since the commercial launch of our first product in the third quarter of 2012, while incurring operating losses since our inception. Our operating results have historically fluctuated on a quarterly or annual basis, particularly in periods surrounding anticipated regulatory approvals, and the commercial launch of products by us and our competitors.\nTotal sales increased $76.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by a 102% increase in worldwide pump shipments to 34,493 in the year ended 2018, compared to 17,061 in the year ended 2017. Worldwide pump shipments were positively impacted by strong demand for our products following the August 2018 launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, the August 2017 launch of t:slim X2 with G5 integration, and the commencement of international sales in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, sales from pump-related supplies increased 66% due to the September 2017 launch of infusion set products using the t:lock connector, as well as an overall increase in our installed customer base of customers reordering supplies. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to over 100% in 2018 from 69% in the year ended 2017.\n \u25cf fluctuations in gross margins and operating margins; and \nIn addition, in 2016 we recorded a $2.8 million charge for inventory excess and obsolescence as the result of the commercialization of t:slim X2, the launch of the Technology Upgrade Program and the larger than anticipated decrease in t:slim G4 sales in the second half of the year. This inventory excess and obsolescence charge negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by three percentage points.\nWe offer products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We commenced commercial sales of our original t:slim insulin pump platform in the United States in the third quarter of 2012 and continued to launch various iterations of that platform the following years. In October 2016, we began shipping our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 insulin pump. The t:slim X2 hardware platform, which includes remote software update capabilities, now represents 100% of our new pump shipments. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018 we discontinued new sales of all prior platform versions. Our products also include disposable cartridges and infusion sets. In addition, we offer accessories including protective cases, belt clips, and power adapters, although such sales are not significant.\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included private placements and public offerings of equity securities, debt financing, and cash collected from product sales. Since the beginning of 2017, we completed the following financings:\n (1) The Barnes Canyon Lease provided for a tenant improvement allowance, or the TI Allowance, of up to approximately $3.4 million to be applied to non-structural improvements to the Barnes Canyon Building, which we fully utilized. The amounts funded by the landlord are subject to an interest accrual at a rate of 8.0% per annum and must be repaid in full during the base term in monthly installments (TI Rent), paid concurrently with the base rent. TI Rent is not included in the table above. TI Rent is expected to be $0.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2023. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include new AID systems, a next-generation hardware platform, and connected (mobile) health offerings. We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionalities that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense). Other expense in 2017 was $10.1 million, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. Other expense in 2017 and 2016 primarily consisted of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan Agreement were $82.7 million and $81.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In 2017, we also recorded a $1.0 million gain from the change in fair value of the common stock warrants. Other income in 2017 and 2016 was not significant.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and are subject to the safe harbor\u201d created by these sections.

Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements can be found under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, and elsewhere in this Annual Report. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made.\nOther Income and Expense\n \u25cf fluctuations in working capital. \n \u25cf the timing and amount of any additional financings, including the exercise of warrants and proceeds from employee stock incentive plans; \nWe generally provide a four-year warranty on our insulin pumps to end user customers and may replace any pumps that do not function in accordance with the product specifications. Insulin pumps returned to us may be refurbished and redeployed. Additionally, we offer a six-month warranty on disposable cartridges and infusion sets. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of shipment to cost of sales. Warranty costs are estimated based on the current expected replacement product cost and expected replacement rates based on historical experience. We evaluate the reserve quarterly and make adjustments when appropriate. Changes to the actual replacement rates could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve.\n \u2022 anticipated and actual regulatory approvals of our products and competitive products. \n \u25cf research and product development efforts, including clinical trial costs; \n \u2022 changes in the competitive landscape, including as a result of companies entering or exiting the diabetes therapy market; \n \u2022 t:slim X2 with Control IQ Technology: Our second-generation AID system is expected to integrate the t:slim X2 with the technology that we licensed from TypeZero and Dexcom's G6 CGM sensor. The iCGM designation for the system also provides the opportunity for integration development efforts with future iCGM sensors that may become available in the market. With our implementation of TypeZero's inControl AID algorithms, our product is intended to both increase and decrease basal insulin based on a user's predicted blood glucose levels from a compatible iCGM sensor, as well as deliver automated correction boluses. In conjunction with Dexcom and TypeZero, which was acquired by Dexcom in August 2018, we have integrated our technologies into the U.S. portion of the Clinical Acceptance of the Artificial Pancreas, or DCLP3, portion of the International Diabetes Closed Loop, or the IDCL, trial. Enrollment for the 6-month study was completed in October 2018. Our t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology has also been evaluated in several early pediatric studies and we intend to support a pivotal study among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes that will commence in the first half of 2019. Our goal is to commence commercial sales of the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology in the United States in the second half of 2019, followed by an international launch in 2020. \nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the increase in sales was primarily driven by an increase in sales of infusion sets to our distributors, as well as an increase in the sale of pump-related supplies to our growing customer base. Pump shipments only slightly increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 17,061 from 16,938 in 2016, which we believe was the result of a number of factors including the highly competitive market, the timing of FDA approval of t:slim X2 with G5, and negative perceptions regarding our financial stability compared to that of our competitors.\nContractual Obligations & Commitments\nResults of Operations\nWe primarily sell our products through national and regional distributors in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. These distributors are generally providers of medical equipment and supplies to individuals with diabetes. Our primary end customers are people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Similar to other durable medical equipment, the primary payor is generally a third-party insurance carrier and the customer is usually responsible for any medical insurance plan copay or coinsurance requirements. We believe our existing sales, clinical, and marketing infrastructure will allow us to continue to increase sales by allowing us to promote our products to a greater number of potential customers, caregivers and healthcare providers.\nSubsequent Events\nThe decrease in net cash used in operating activities for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily associated with a reduction in the net loss when adjusted for non-cash expenses, particularly the change in the fair value of Series A and Series B warrants, increased stock-based compensation expense, and the loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as net changes in working capital. Our operating loss included $10.8 million and $7.9 million in cash paid for interest in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Working capital changes were due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales, offset by a reduction in inventory and increases in employee related liabilities and deferred revenue. Inventory decreased to $19.9 million at December 31, 2018 from $27.0 at December 31, 2017 due to an increase in pump production and sales demand during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the timing of certain inventory receipts.\nWe expect our sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash flow from operations, liquidity position and cash management decisions. Our ability to raise additional financing may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including our recent and projected financial results, recent changes in and volatility of our stock price, perceptions about the dilutive impact of financing transactions, the competitive environment in our industry, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment.\n \u2022 market acceptance of our products and competitive products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers; \nIn August 2018, we fully repaid our term loan with CRG pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement. The balance of the outstanding debt at the time of repayment was $82.7 million. The repayment included approximately $1.1 million in accrued interest and $5.0 million in associated financing fees that became due. Therefore, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2018. At the time of repayment, the remaining $5.3 million debt discount balance associated with the financing fees and certain debt issuance costs was accelerated and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $82.7 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 and a $4.1 million liability for financing fees.\nSales to domestic distributors accounted for 78% and 75% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor. The percentage was particularly impacted in 2018 by the mid-2017 launch of the t:lock connector, which resulted in greater purchases of infusion sets by our independent distributors during the period as compared to the same period during the prior year. Sales to international distributors accounted for 100% of our total international sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we shipped 34,493 insulin pumps worldwide compared to 17,061 insulin pumps shipped in 2017. In the United States we have shipped more than 79,000 pumps within the four-year period ended December 31, 2018. Pump shipments in the United States by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nWe are a medical device company with an innovative approach to the design, development and commercialization of products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our unique consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing, sales and support activities exclusively focus on our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim X2, and our complementary product offerings. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is based on our proprietary technology platform and is the smallest durable insulin pump available. It is the only pump currently available in the United States that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. By delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support, we aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and their healthcare providers.\nWe believe that our business condition and financial results, as well as the decision-making process of our customers, has been and will continue to be impacted by a number of general trends and factors, including the following:\nIndebtedness\nTrends Impacting Financial Results\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\nExcluding the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, the improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of per-unit manufacturing cost improvements, including significant raw material cost reductions for pumps and overall manufacturing efficiencies for both pumps and cartridges, as well as contribution from the incremental sales of infusion sets. Other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training, also improved.\n \u25cf acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets; and \nWe entered into a series of amendments to the Term Loan Agreement in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which included the addition of a financing fee payable at the maturity of the term loans, the issuance of warrants to purchase 193,788 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $23.50 per share, or the CRG Warrant, and certain other minimum financing covenants. The CRG Warrant had a term of 10 years from the date of issuance and would have expired on March 7, 2027. The financing fee was applicable to the entire aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding, including total PIK Loans issued.\nTechnology Upgrade Program\n \u2022 expansion in select international geographies, which began in the third quarter of 2018. \nPrior to the implementation of this new standard, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, delivery had occurred and title passed, the price was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured.\nIn general, in the United States we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, product shipments being weighted heavily towards the second half of the year, with the highest percentage of product shipments expected in the fourth quarter of the year due to the nature of the reimbursement environment. Consistent with our historical seasonality, we also expect domestic product shipments from the fourth quarter to the following first quarter to decrease significantly. Internationally, we do not expect this same impact from seasonality. However, the opportunity for the transition of former Animas customers in 2019 may also impact our quarterly sales trends worldwide.\n (1) The pump units shipped do not reflect returns or exchanges of pump products that occur in the ordinary course of business. \nAt December 31, 2018, we had $129.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing.\nSales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included the recognition of $5.0 million of pump sales originally deferred in prior periods and upgrade fees received as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales were $84.2 million, reduced by $4.3 million of deferred pump sales as a result of our Technology Upgrade Program.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nJumpStart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act)\nOther income and expense primarily consists of changes in the fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants issued in our public offering of common stock in October 2017, as well as interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated funds, or CRG. In August 2018, we fully repaid amounts due under the Term Loan Agreement. Prior to that, there was $82.7 million of outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement, which accrued interest at a coupon rate of\n</table>\n \u2022 continued increase in demand following the commercial launch of t:slim X2 and the demonstrated success of our Tandem Device Updater, which we expect will positively impact our sales; \nCost of Sales\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe have commercially launched six insulin pumps in the United States since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Three of these pumps have featured continuous glucose monitoring technology, or CGM. In the past four years, we have shipped approximately 84,000 pumps, over 4,000 of which were in international markets, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer base on the typical four-year reimbursement cycle.\nThe improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of the increase in pump shipments which have a higher gross margin than pump-related supplies, as well as per-unit cost improvements on all products from increased production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies. As a whole, other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training costs, also reflected improvement.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Selected Financial Data\u201d in Part II, Item 6 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, which statements are subject to considerable risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nIn the United States, our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps' software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater provides our in-warranty domestic customers potential access to new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. The first use of our Tandem Device Updater was for our deployment of the latest t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. Since that time, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers in the United States two significant software updates: (i) integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system in September 2017; and (ii) an upgrade to our new Basal-IQ technology and integration with Dexcom's G6 CGM in August 2018. Our Tandem Device Updater positions us to bring future innovations and AID algorithms to t:slim X2 customers, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle. Though we have not utilized our Tandem Device Updater to perform software updates for devices outside the United States, we are currently developing that capability, and intend to do so in the future.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u2022 Connected (Mobile) Health Offerings: We are currently developing a mobile application that is being designed to utilize the capability of the Bluetooth radio to wirelessly upload pump data to t:connect, receive notification of pump alerts and alarms, integrate other health-related information from third party sources, and support future pump-control capabilities for our products under development. Subject to FDA approval, we intend to launch the first generation of our mobile application with a subset of these features in the United States in 2019. \nSales. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales were $183.9 million, which included $9.7 million from international sales that commenced in the third quarter of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included incremental net pump sales of $5.0 million as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program in place at that time.\n \u2022 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors, and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors; \n \u2022 seasonality in the United States associated with annual insurance deductibles and coinsurance requirements associated with the medical insurance plans utilized by our customers and the customers of our distributors; \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 22% to $105.2 million in 2018 from $86.4 million in 2017. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $18.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, including an increase of $11.6 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our growing installed customer base. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. Additionally, this included an increase of $6.8 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\n \u2022 In August 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 4,035,085 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $28.50 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \nSelling, General and Administrative\nWe expect our overall gross margin percentage, which for any given period is calculated as sales less cost of sales divided by sales, to improve over the long-term, as our sales increase and our overhead costs are spread over larger production volumes. We expect we will be able to leverage our manufacturing cost structure across our products that utilize the same proprietary technology platform and manufacturing infrastructure, and will be able to further reduce costs with increased automation, process improvements and raw materials cost reductions. Pumps have, and are expected to continue to have, a higher gross margin than our pump-related supplies. Therefore, the percentage of pump sales relative to total sales will have a significant impact on gross margin. We also expect our warranty costs per unit to decrease as we release product features and functionality utilizing the Tandem Device Updater. However, our overall gross margin may fluctuate in future quarterly periods as a result of numerous factors aside from those associated with production volumes and product mix. .\n \u2022 In February 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 34,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $69.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. \n \u25cf payments under licensing, development and commercialization agreements. \nResearch and Development\n \u2022 the magnitude and timing of any changes to our facilities, manufacturing operations and other infrastructure; and \nIn January 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for 25,332 square feet of additional general administrative office space located at 10935 Vista Sorrento Parkway, San Diego, California. Subject to limited exceptions, the initial lease term is expected to commence on the later of (i) March 1, 2019, or (ii) the date on which the landlord substantially completes certain specified work related to tenant improvements, such date, the Commencement Date, and will expire 42 months from the first day of the first full month following the Commencement Date. We also have a one-time option to extend the term of the lease for a period of five years by delivering prior written notice to the landlord in accordance with the terms of the lease.\n \u2022 increased opportunity to achieve customer renewals as customers become eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump at the end of the typical four-year reimbursement cycle; \n \u25cf support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products; \nOur research and development, or R&D, activities primarily consist of engineering and research programs associated with our products under development, as well as activities associated with our core technologies and processes. R&D expenses are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, non-cash stock-based compensation and temporary employee expenses. We also incur R&D expenses for supplies, development prototypes, outside design and testing services, depreciation, allocated facilities and information services, clinical trial costs, payments under our licensing, development and commercialization agreements and other indirect costs. We expect our R&D expenses to increase as we advance our products under development and develop new products and technologies, as well as continue to reflect a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the impact of the increase in our stock price over the past year.\nOur selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses primarily consist of salary, cash-based incentive compensation, fringe benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, marketing, sales, clinical, customer support, technical services, insurance verification, regulatory affairs and other administrative functions. In particular, our sales and clinical organization consisted of approximately 70 territories as of December 31, 2018 and our operations in Canada will be supported by a direct sales force of approximately 10 field representatives. Territories in the United States are maintained by sales representatives and field clinical specialists, and supported by managed care liaisons, additional sales management and other customer support personnel. We expect to modestly increase our number of sales personnel in the near term in order to optimize the coverage of our existing territories. Other significant SG&A expenses include those incurred for product demonstration samples, commercialization activities associated with new product launches, travel, trade shows, outside legal fees, independent auditor fees, outside consultant fees, insurance premiums, facilities costs and information technology costs. Overall, we expect our SG&A expenses, including the cost of our customer support infrastructure, to increase as our customer base grows in the United States and in international geographies. Additionally, we realized a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2018 from the increase in our stock price over the past year. We expect higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be sustained in future quarters as a result of the valuation of certain employee option grants. Our SG&A expenses may also increase due to anticipated costs associated with additional compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.\nOperating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $66.1 million and $61.2 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn the second half of 2018, we began selling the t:slim X2 with G5, in select geographies outside the United States, including Canada. We have discontinued sales of our original t:slim, t:flex and t:slim G4 pumps, and our t:slim X2 hardware platform now represents 100% of new pump shipments. However, we continue to provide ongoing service and support for our earlier products.\nPump shipments to international customers by fiscal quarter were as follows:\nItem 7.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Our cost of sales in 2018 was $94.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $89.8 million, compared to $63.5 million of cost of sales and gross profit of $44.1 million in 2017, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program.\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\nSince inception, we have derived nearly all of our sales from the shipment of insulin pumps and associated supplies in the United States. Starting in the third quarter of 2018, we commenced sales of our t:slim X2 insulin pump in select international geographies. We consider the number of units shipped per quarter to be an important metric for managing our business.\n\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to fluctuation based on a number of factors. In particular, our cash inflows and outflows are principally impacted by the following:\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses increased 41% to $29.2 million in 2018 from $20.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of employee-related expenses. This includes a $4.1 million increase in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our product development efforts. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. There was also an increase of $3.1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 4% to $86.4 million in 2017 from $82.8 million in 2016. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $3.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016, including an increase of $0.9 million in salaries and fringe benefits, as well as an increase in cash-based incentive compensation of $2.1 million and stock-based compensation of $0.7 million.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nFor additional information, see the section of this Annual Report under the caption Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nThe gross margin in 2017 was 41%, compared to 28% in 2016. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point. The net reduction of gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program negatively affected our gross margin for 2016 by four percentage points.\n11.5% per annum. As a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018, but there will be no related interest expense or costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement in future years. Our interest and other income also includes interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. We expect other income and expense to fluctuate from period to period due to revaluations of the outstanding Series A warrants, which expire in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n \u2022 the timing of the commercialization of new products by us or our competitors; \n \u2022 the buying patterns of our distributors and other customers; \n (3) Includes purchase orders that are cancellable under the standard terms of our purchase order agreements. In certain cases, cancelation of outstanding purchase commitments may require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancelation. \nSales of insulin pumps were $71.5 million and $62.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of pump-related supplies were $35.6 million, of which $21.4 million were sales of infusion sets and $14.2 million were sales of cartridges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of pump-related supplies were $21.4 million, of which $9.7 million were sales of infusion sets and $11.7 million were sales of cartridges. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approached 100% during December, compared to 31% in 2016. Sales of accessories were not significant in either year.\n (2) 2016 and 2017 U.S. shipments do not include approximately 3,300 trade-ins fulfilled under the Technology Upgrade Program (discussed below) related to our commercial launch of t:slim X2. \nProduct Returns\n \u2022 t:sport Insulin Delivery System: Expected to be half the size of our t:slim X2 pump, the t:sport pump is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump. We anticipate that t:sport will feature a 200-unit cartridge, an on-pump bolus button, a rechargeable battery, an AID algorithm, and a Bluetooth radio. t:sport is being designed for use with leading U-100 insulins, and we are evaluating the use of insulin concentrates to provide people with greater insulin needs. t:sport will utilize a pumping mechanism that differs from our current Micro-Delivery technology. \n\n \u2022 timing of holidays and summer vacations which vary by geography; \nWe consider the deliverables in our product offering to be separate performance obligations. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration expected to be received, based either on the stated value in contractual arrangements or the estimated cash to be collected in non-contracted arrangements. We allocate the consideration to the individual performance obligations and recognize the consideration based on when the performance obligation is satisfied, considering whether or not this occurs at a point in time or over time.\nOur insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to selling insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user's body.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017, we offered a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure, as a pathway for certain existing customers to obtain the t:slim X2. Due to the high degree of accounting complexity, the program created unpredictable financial results under U.S. GAAP for the duration of the program. The accounting treatment for the program required us to defer up to 100% of sales at the time of pump shipment and recognize them in a subsequent period, either when the upgrade was fulfilled or at the expiration of the program. We recognized the deferred amount of sales and cost of sales at the earlier of when the obligations under the program were satisfied or upon the expiration of the program. If a customer elected to participate in the program, we recognized any upgrade fees that we received and the associated costs at the time of fulfilling the given obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incremental net sales of $5.0 million with a corresponding increase of $3.1 million in gross profit as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a deferral of sales of $4.3 million and a net decrease in gross profit of $4.6 million as a result of the program. The program expired on September 30, 2017 and, therefore, has no impact on our 2018 financial results.", "item_7_tables": "Table 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Pump Units Shipped for Each of the
