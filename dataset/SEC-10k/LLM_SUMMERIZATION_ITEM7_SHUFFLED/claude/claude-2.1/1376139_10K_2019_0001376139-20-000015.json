The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the Petroleum Segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the Petroleum Segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the Petroleum Segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the renewable fuel standards ( RFS\u201d) of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $100 to $110 million for 2020.\n2019 Market Conditions\nNYMEX WTI crude oil is an industry wide benchmark that is utilized in the market pricing of a barrel of crude oil. Other crude oils that are compared to WTI, known as differentials, show how the market for other crude oils such as WCS, White Cliffs ( Condensate\u201d), Brent Crude ( Brent\u201d), and Midland WTI ( Midland\u201d) are trending. During 2019, there were price fluctuations within these differentials due to the continued curtailments imposed by the Alberta government, therefore, tightening the WCS to WTI differential. Additionally, there have been start-up and line fill of new pipelines from West Texas to the Gulf Coast further tightening the domestic differentials against WTI.\nAs a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we utilize the NYMEX and the Mid-Continent crack spreads. These crack spreads are a measure of the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in refining margins. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread is calculated using two barrels of WTI producing one barrel of NYMEX RBOB Gasoline ( RBOB\u201d) and one barrel of NYMEX NY Harbor ULSD ( HO\u201d). The Mid-Continent 2-1-1 crack spread is calculated using two barrels of WTI crude oil producing one barrel of Group 3 gasoline and one barrel of Group 3 diesel.\nNYMEX 2-1-1 crack spreads increased during 2019 compared to 2018 while the Mid-Continent 2-1-1 crack spreads showed a reduction. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread averaged $19.93 per barrel in 2019 compared to $19.42 per barrel in 2018. The Mid-Continent 2-1-1 crack spread averaged $18.22 per barrel in 2019 compared to $18.63 per barrel in 2018.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 43\nThe tables below are presented, on a per barrel basis, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)For December 2019, the average differentials for Midland and Condensate were $0.97 and $(0.15), respectively.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 44\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the charts above, is illustrated below.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in $/bbl) </td> <td>Average 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average December 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average December 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average December 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(3)Information used within these charts was obtained from MarketView.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nWithin the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization rates, and operating costs and expenses, including pet coke and natural gas feedstock costs.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\n2019 Market Conditions\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve should continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S. over the longer term.\nDuring 2019, weather significantly impacted the demand for UAN and ammonia due to lack of extended dry conditions required for planting, caused by excessive rain delaying planting of corn and soybean crops. However, as a result of this delay, there was additional demand for UAN and ammonia due to the catch up from the late start to 2019 application season, but the fall season also had excessive moisture, which limited the ability to apply nitrogen. Consistent with the past 18 months,\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 45\ncustomers have been purchasing fertilizers more ratably and the expectations that harvest will be later than normal has led customers to stage their buying. Weather (i.e., heavy rains, flooding, etc.) is going to dictate the timing of harvest and the available window for ammonia application.\nCorn and soybean are two major crops planted by farmers in the U.S. Corn crop has shown to deplete the amount of nitrogen and ammonia within the soil it is grown in, which in turn, results in a need for these nutrients to be replenished after each growing cycle. Unlike corn, soybean is able to obtain its own nitrogen through a process known as N fixation\u201d. As such, upon harvesting of soybean, the soil retains a certain amount of nitrogen which results in lower demand for nitrogen for the pursuing corn planting cycle. Due to these factors, nitrogen fertilizer consumers generally follow a balanced corn-soybean rotational planting cycle as evident through the chart presented below for 2018 and 2017. Due to the significant weather conditions discussed above, the 2019 planting cycle relied more heavily on corn planting to obtain sufficient crop harvests, which slightly adjusted this balance.\nThe relationship between the total acres planted for both corn and soybean has a direct impact on the overall demand for UAN and ammonia products. As the number of corn\u201d acres increases, the market and demand for UAN and ammonia also increases. Correspondingly, as the number of soybean\u201d acres increases the market and demand for UAN and ammonia decreases.\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment by month through December 31, 2019:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Information used within this chart was obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 46\n(2)Information used within these charts was obtained from various third-party sources including Green Markets (a Bloomberg Company), Pace Petroleum Coke Quarterly, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d), amongst others.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined within the previous sections of this Part II, Item 7, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating income and net income were $574 million and $559 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases of $30 million and $48 million, respectively, are driven primarily by higher refining margins when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Refining margin was $1,203 million, or $15.26 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,178 million, or $15.18 per throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in refining margin of $25 million is primarily due to increased throughput volumes and lower RINs expense due to a reduction in market prices. Further, there was a gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal of $9 million (occurred in the second quarter of 2019), positively impacting the Petroleum Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment net sales increased by $53 million to $404\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 47\nmillion as a result of favorable pricing and higher volumes. The increase in volumes was primarily attributable to a shift in demand from the fourth quarter 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 due to inclement weather.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $129 million, or 26.2% of income before income taxes, as compared to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $79 million, or 17.8% of income before income taxes. The fluctuation in income tax expense was due primarily to the decrease in non-controlling interest from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in non-controlling interest is due to the Company's January 29, 2019 purchase of all issued and outstanding CVR Refining common units not already owned by the Company. Refer to Note 1 ( Organization and Nature of Business\u201d) for a further discussion of this transaction. The effective income tax rate varies from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of the decrease in non-controlling interest and the benefits of state income tax credits.\nSegment Financial Highlights and Results of Operations\nPetroleum Segment\nThe Petroleum Segment utilizes certain inputs within its refining operations. These inputs include crude oil, butanes, natural gasoline, ethanol, and bio-diesel (these are also known as throughputs\u201d).\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery\nTable 71:

year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate prices. However, the Petroleum Segment's EBITDA improved by $40 million from 2018 mainly due to decreased raw materials costs and favorable inventory impact.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nRefining Margin - Refining margin was $1,203 million, or $15.26 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,178 million, or $15.18 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased throughput volumes and lower RINs expense resulting from a reduction in market prices, partially offset by decreased gains on derivatives in the current period. Total throughput averaged 215,971 bpd for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 212,595 bpd for the same period in 2018. Derivative gains decreased by $127 million during 2019 compared to 2018.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 50\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDirect Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) - Direct operating expenses on a total throughput barrel basis decreased to $4.56 per barrel from $4.62 per barrel largely due to the increased throughput volumes. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $359 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of approximately $3 million was primarily due to increased personnel costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of net additions during the current year. Capitalization of turnaround expense along with adoption of ASC 842 also contributed to this increase.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other was $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $14 million decrease was primarily a result of a $9 million gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal in the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease in project write-offs in 2019 compared to 2018.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nThe following tables summarize the ammonia utilization at the Coffeyville and East Dubuque facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity adjusted for planned maintenance and turnarounds.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 51\nThe presentation of our utilization is on a two-year rolling average which takes into account the impact of our planned and unplanned outages on any specific period. We believe the two-year rolling average is a more useful presentation of the long-term utilization performance of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's facilities.\nUtilization is presented solely on ammonia production, rather than each nitrogen product, as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of facility configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on ammonia upgrade capabilities, we believe this measure provides a meaningful view of how well we operate.\nOn a consolidated basis, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's utilization decreased 2% to 93% for the two years ended December 31, 2019 compared to the two years ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily a result of ammonia storage capacity constraints at the East Dubuque Facility in the first quarter of 2019 due to inclement weather impacting customers' ability to apply ammonia and the turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure comparable across the fertilizer industry.\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced, that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.

This increase was primarily due to favorable pricing conditions which contributed $49 million in higher revenues coupled with increased sales volumes contributing $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Urea sales. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net sales included $33 million and $34 million in freight revenues, respectively, and $8 million and $8 million in other revenue, respectively.\nThe following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales, excluding freight, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in UAN and ammonia sales pricing for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a shift in the timing of demand from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, as customers delayed receipt of nitrogen products due to continued inclement weather. As a result, customer demand for ammonia increased in the second quarter of 2019 as customers attempted to make up for the missed application. In addition, the aforementioned ammonia application, coupled with freezing temperatures and flooding throughout the Midwest and Southern Plains in 2019, shifted the demand for ammonia, resulting in increased sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Urea sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the turnaround at our East Dubuque Facility.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 54\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nCost of Materials and Other - Cost of materials and other for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $94 million, compared to $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $6 million increase was comprised primarily of a $5 million increase in pet coke costs at our Coffeyville Facility and a $6 million increase related to a draw in our ammonia and UAN inventories offset by decreased natural gas costs at our East Dubuque facility contributing $5 million.\nDirect Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $174 million as compared to $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $15 million increase was primarily due to increased turnaround costs of $3 million, increased repairs and maintenance costs of $1 million, and an inventory draw contributing $10 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of accelerated depreciation of certain assets, coupled with additions to property, plant, and equipment during the current year.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other increased approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to asset write offs in the period contributing $3 million, coupled with increased personnel costs contributing $1 million.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 55\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company revised its accounting policy method for the costs of planned major maintenance activities (turnarounds) specific to the Petroleum Segment from being expensed as incurred (the direct expensing method) to the deferral method. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d) for a further discussion of the impacts of this change in accounting policy. As a result of this change in accounting policy, the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Petroleum Adjusted EBITDA, Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Direct Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel net of Turnaround Expense are no longer being presented.\nThe following are non-GAAP measures we present for the year ended December 31, 2019:\nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nRefining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other.\nRefining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\nRefining Margin and Refining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts, per Throughput Barrel - Refining Margin divided by the total throughput barrels during period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d included herein for reconciliation of these amounts.

Changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices decrease. The inventory valuation impact is calculated based upon inventory values at the beginning of the accounting period and at the end of the accounting period. In order to derive the inventory valuation impact per total throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for the inventory valuation impact and divide by the number of total throughput barrels for the period.\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Total Throughput Barrels\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying dividends to our stockholders, as further discussed below.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under CVR Partners' AB Credit Facility and CVR Refining's Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future operational performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations, and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe Company, and its subsidiaries, were in compliance with all covenants under their respective debt instruments as of December 31, 2019, as applicable.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 59\nCash Balances and Other Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $652 million, $393 million available under CVR Refining's Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility and $50 million available under CVR Partners' AB Credit Facility.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Partners:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9.25% Senior Secured Notes due June 2023\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due April 2021\n</td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Partners debt\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Refining:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022 (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance cost\n</td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Refining debt </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,126 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)On January 27, 2020, the Company redeemed all of the 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022 for a redemption price equal to 101.083%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redeemed notes.\nCVR Partners\nThe Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has a 9.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, 6.50% Senior Notes due 2021, and an AB Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes.

Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses.

For example, we may experience unexpected changes in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer facilities. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nIn the Petroleum Segment, we capitalized $38 million and $8 million of turnaround expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The next planned major turnaround within the Petroleum Segment is at the Coffeyville refinery commencing in the first quarter of 2020 with total estimated expenditures of $145 million to $155 million, of which $130 million to $140 million is expected to be incurred and capitalized in the spring of 2020. As to the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment, the East Dubuque facility began a major scheduled turnaround on September 14, 2019, which was completed in October. We incurred $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to this turnaround.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nIEP, through its ownership of the Company's common shares, is entitled to receive dividends that are declared and paid by the Company based on the number of shares held at each record date.

While the Stock Repurchase Program currently has a duration of four years, it does not obligate the Company to acquire any stock and may be terminated by the Company's Board of Directors at any time. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(121) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(276) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(642) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(254) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe change in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $152 million, partially offset by a reduction in operating results, excluding non-cash items, of $22 million and unfavorable changes in non-current assets and liabilities of $11 million.\nInvesting Activities\nThe change in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to the receipt of $36 million of proceeds from the sale of Cushing assets net of carrying value of inventory sold as part of the divestment. These net proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of $19 million and an increase in turnaround expenditures of $30 million primarily relating to preparations in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 62\nCoffeyville refinery turnaround scheduled for completion in 2020 and completion of the Wynnewood refinery turnaround in the second quarter of 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to $301 million in funds used to acquire the remaining CVR Refining common units not otherwise owned by us, along with increases in CVR Energy dividends and CVR Partners distributions paid to public unitholders of $68 million and $30 million, respectively, compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in distributions to CVR Refining public unitholders of $93 million.\nLong-Term Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations.

This increase was primarily due to favorable pricing conditions which contributed $49 million in higher revenues coupled with increased sales volumes contributing $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Urea sales. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net sales included $33 million and $34 million in freight revenues, respectively, and $8 million and $8 million in other revenue, respectively.\n \nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\n \nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total throughput barrels per day </td> <td>215,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218,181 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days in the period </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total throughput barrels\n</td> <td>78,829,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,597,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,636,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we utilize the NYMEX and the Mid-Continent crack spreads. These crack spreads are a measure of the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in refining margins. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread is calculated using two barrels of WTI producing one barrel of NYMEX RBOB Gasoline ( RBOB\u201d) and one barrel of NYMEX NY Harbor ULSD ( HO\u201d).

The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the Petroleum Segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the Petroleum Segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the Petroleum Segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nCVR Energy\n(2)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(121) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(276) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(642) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(254) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $129 million, or 26.2% of income before income taxes, as compared to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $79 million, or 17.8% of income before income taxes. The fluctuation in income tax expense was due primarily to the decrease in non-controlling interest from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in non-controlling interest is due to the Company's January 29, 2019 purchase of all issued and outstanding CVR Refining common units not already owned by the Company.

However, the Petroleum Segment's EBITDA improved by $40 million from 2018 mainly due to decreased raw materials costs and favorable inventory impact.\nThe increase in UAN and ammonia sales pricing for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a shift in the timing of demand from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, as customers delayed receipt of nitrogen products due to continued inclement weather. As a result, customer demand for ammonia increased in the second quarter of 2019 as customers attempted to make up for the missed application. In addition, the aforementioned ammonia application, coupled with freezing temperatures and flooding throughout the Midwest and Southern Plains in 2019, shifted the demand for ammonia, resulting in increased sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Urea sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the turnaround at our East Dubuque Facility.\n \nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nStrategy and Goals\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2019 Actual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 Estimate (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Maintenance </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating income and net income were $574 million and $559 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases of $30 million and $48 million, respectively, are driven primarily by higher refining margins when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Refining margin was $1,203 million, or $15.26 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,178 million, or $15.18 per throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in refining margin of $25 million is primarily due to increased throughput volumes and lower RINs expense due to a reduction in market prices. Further, there was a gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal of $9 million (occurred in the second quarter of 2019), positively impacting the Petroleum Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment net sales increased by $53 million to $404\nPetroleum Segment\nMission and Core Values\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nOur core values are driven by our people, inform the way we do business each and every day and enhance our ability to accomplish our mission and related strategic objectives.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2) </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations (3) </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations (4) </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (5) </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (6) </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2019 | 52\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividends Paid (in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related Period </td> <td> </td> <td>Date Paid </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>IEP </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 -

However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future operational performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nUtilization is presented solely on ammonia production, rather than each nitrogen product, as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of facility configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on ammonia upgrade capabilities, we believe this measure provides a meaningful view of how well we operate.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined within the previous sections of this Part II, Item 7, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\n\n(1)The feedstock natural gas shown above does not include natural gas used for fuel.

We are focusing on improvements in day-to-day plant operations, identifying alternative sources for plant inputs to reduce lost\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 48\nDecember 31, 2019 | 45\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company revised its accounting policy method for the costs of planned major maintenance activities (turnarounds) specific to the Petroleum Segment from being expensed as incurred (the direct expensing method) to the deferral method. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d) for a further discussion of the impacts of this change in accounting policy. As a result of this change in accounting policy, the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Petroleum Adjusted EBITDA, Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Direct Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel net of Turnaround Expense are no longer being presented.\nWe divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment by month through December 31, 2019:\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced, that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.

Environmental liabilities represents our estimated payments required by federal and/or state environmental agencies. See Part I, Item 1, Environmental Matters.\u201d\n\n \nThe change in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $152 million, partially offset by a reduction in operating results, excluding non-cash items, of $22 million and unfavorable changes in non-current assets and liabilities of $11 million.\n \nAchievements\nDuring 2019, weather significantly impacted the demand for UAN and ammonia due to lack of extended dry conditions required for planting, caused by excessive rain delaying planting of corn and soybean crops. However, as a result of this delay, there was additional demand for UAN and ammonia due to the catch up from the late start to 2019 application season, but the fall season also had excessive moisture, which limited the ability to apply nitrogen. Consistent with the past 18 months,\n \nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d), of this Report for a discussion of these, and other, accounting policies.\n \n\u2022Inventory finished goods valuation; and\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Partnership recognized a $6 million business interruption insurance recovery associated with an outage at its Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility during 2017.

We understand our obligation to the environment and that it's our duty to protect it.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nOn October 23, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program (the Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). The Stock Repurchase Program would enable the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company's common stock. Repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Program may be made from time-to-time through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing, price and amount of repurchases (if any) will be made at the discretion of management and are subject to market conditions as well as corporate, regulatory and other considerations. While the Stock Repurchase Program currently has a duration of four years, it does not obligate the Company to acquire any stock and may be terminated by the Company's Board of Directors at any time. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2019 Market Conditions\nLong-Term Commitments\n\n(4)The amount includes (i) commitments for petroleum products storage and petroleum transportation, (ii) electricity supply agreement, (iii) a product supply agreement, (iv) a pet coke supply agreement, (v) commitments related to our biofuels blending obligation, and (vi) various agreements for gas and gas transportation.\n(2)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the charts above, is illustrated below.\n\u2022Impairment of long-lived assets;\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Total Throughput Barrels\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate.

Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity adjusted for planned maintenance and turnarounds.\nCoffeyville Refinery - During the fourth quarter of 2019, our Coffeyville Refinery incurred costs of $15 million related to preparations for the planned turnaround scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2020. During the first quarter of 2018, our Coffeyville Refinery experienced an outage with its fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCCU\u201d) lasting 48 days. The FCCU outage had a significant negative impact on production and sales during that period.\nCoffeyville Fertilizer Facility - During 2018, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 15 days and incurred approximately $6 million in turnaround expense in the second quarter of 2018. During 2017, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility's third-party air separation unit experienced a shut down. Paired with this shut down and subsequent operational challenges, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility experienced unplanned UAN downtime of 11 days during the second quarter of 2017.\nThe Partnership did not pay distributions during the year ended December 31, 2018, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, it paid a distribution of $0.02 per common unit, or $2 million. Of this distribution, CVR Energy received $1 million.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 63\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve should continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S. over the longer term.\nThe Petroleum Segment utilizes certain inputs within its refining operations. These inputs include crude oil, butanes, natural gasoline, ethanol, and bio-diesel (these are also known as throughputs\u201d).\nOn February 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 to the Company's stockholders of $0.80 per share, or $80 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be paid on March 9, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2020. IEP will receive approximately $57 million in respect of its ownership interest in the Company's shares.\n\u2022Income taxes;\nSegment Financial Highlights and Results of Operations\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document.\n \nDecember 31, 2019 | 59\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of net additions during the current year. Capitalization of turnaround expense along with adoption of ASC 842 also contributed to this increase.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA\n\nThe change in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to $301 million in funds used to acquire the remaining CVR Refining common units not otherwise owned by us, along with increases in CVR Energy dividends and CVR Partners distributions paid to public unitholders of $68 million and $30 million, respectively, compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in distributions to CVR Refining public unitholders of $93 million.\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 46\n(1)For December 2019, the average differentials for Midland and Condensate were $0.97 and $(0.15), respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid dividends totaling $2.50 and $2.00 per common unit, or $238 million and $174 million, respectively. Of these dividends, IEP received $179 million and $142 million, respectively, for the same periods.\nmillion as a result of favorable pricing and higher volumes. The increase in volumes was primarily attributable to a shift in demand from the fourth quarter 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 due to inclement weather.\nOur estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope, and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience unexpected changes in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer facilities. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 42\nPetroleum Segment\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other increased approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to asset write offs in the period contributing $3 million, coupled with increased personnel costs contributing $1 million.\n\n(1)Total 2020 estimated capitalized costs include approximately $45 to 55 million of growth related projects that will require additional approvals before commencement.\nCash Flows\nDecember 31, 2019 | 60\n\u2022Derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments;\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2019 relating to contractual obligations and other commercial commitments for the five-year period following December 31, 2019 and thereafter.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 62\n \nRefining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\n(3)Information used within these charts was obtained from MarketView.\nThis discussion and analysis generally discusses the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between such periods. The discussions of the year ended December 31, 2017 and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 12, 2019, and such discussion are incorporated by reference into this Report.\n \nWe successfully executed a number of achievements in support of our strategic objectives shown below through the date of this filing:\nWe have outlined the following strategic objectives to drive the accomplishment of our mission:\nIn the Petroleum Segment, we capitalized $38 million and $8 million of turnaround expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The next planned major turnaround within the Petroleum Segment is at the Coffeyville refinery commencing in the first quarter of 2020 with total estimated expenditures of $145 million to $155 million, of which $130 million to $140 million is expected to be incurred and capitalized in the spring of 2020. As to the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment, the East Dubuque facility began a major scheduled turnaround on September 14, 2019, which was completed in October. We incurred $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to this turnaround.\n \n\nThe following are non-GAAP measures we present for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n(1)On January 27, 2020, the Company redeemed all of the 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022 for a redemption price equal to 101.083%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redeemed notes.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 50\n \nOperating Activities\n \nThe presentation of our utilization is on a two-year rolling average which takes into account the impact of our planned and unplanned outages on any specific period. We believe the two-year rolling average is a more useful presentation of the long-term utilization performance of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's facilities.\n(5)Interest payments for our long-term debt outstanding and finance lease obligations as of December 31, 2019 and commitment fees on the unutilized commitments of the AB Credit Facility.\nDistributions to CVR Partners' Unitholders\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Refining Margin Adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impact per Total Throughput Barrel\nDecember 31, 2019 | 54\n(1)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d), of this Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations, and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 44\nDecember 31, 2019 | 47\nDividends, if any, including the payment, amount and timing thereof, are subject to change at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $652 million, $393 million available under CVR Refining's Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility and $50 million available under CVR Partners' AB Credit Facility.\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Refining Margin per Total Throughput Barrel\nFeedstock - Our Coffeyville Facility utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas in its production of ammonia. The table below presents these feedstocks for both facilities within the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n(2)Information used within these charts was obtained from various third-party sources including Green Markets (a Bloomberg Company), Pace Petroleum Coke Quarterly, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d), amongst others.\n2019 Market Conditions\n Liquid volume yield 97.1 % 97.3 % 96.9 % \nFinancing Activities\nDecember 31, 2019 | 55\n \nRefining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 58\nDirect Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) - For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $174 million as compared to $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $15 million increase was primarily due to increased turnaround costs of $3 million, increased repairs and maintenance costs of $1 million, and an inventory draw contributing $10 million.\nFinancial Discipline - We strive to be as efficient as possible by maintaining low operating costs and a disciplined deployment of capital.\n \nDecember 31, 2019 | 53\n \nDecember 31, 2019 | 57\nStrategic Objectives\n \n\n(1)Information used within this chart was obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service.\n \nDirect Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) - Direct operating expenses on a total throughput barrel basis decreased to $4.56 per barrel from $4.62 per barrel largely due to the increased throughput volumes. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were $359 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of approximately $3 million was primarily due to increased personnel costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In order to apply these principles, management must make judgments, assumptions, and estimates based on the best available information at the time.

The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread averaged $19.93 per barrel in 2019 compared to $19.42 per barrel in 2018. The Mid-Continent 2-1-1 crack spread averaged $18.22 per barrel in 2019 compared to $18.63 per barrel in 2018.\nIEP, through its ownership of the Company's common shares, is entitled to receive dividends that are declared and paid by the Company based on the number of shares held at each record date. The following presents dividends paid to the Company's stockholders, including IEP, during the years ended December 31, 2019:\nThe change in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to the receipt of $36 million of proceeds from the sale of Cushing assets net of carrying value of inventory sold as part of the divestment. These net proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of $19 million and an increase in turnaround expenditures of $30 million primarily relating to preparations in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the\nCVR Partners\ncustomers have been purchasing fertilizers more ratably and the expectations that harvest will be later than normal has led customers to stage their buying. Weather (i.e., heavy rains, flooding, etc.) is going to dictate the timing of harvest and the available window for ammonia application.\n(2)We lease railcars, pipelines, storage, real estate, and other assets.\n\nWynnewood Refinery - During the first quarter of 2017, the Wynnewood Refinery underwent a turnaround on its hydrocracking unit at a cost of $13 million. In addition, the first phase of its planned facility turnaround was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a cost of $43 million. The second phase of this turnaround was completed in the first quarter of 2019 at a cost of $24 million.\n\u2022Goodwill impairment;\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\n(1)Consists of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, and excluded from the table above, the Company issued the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes and redeemed the 2022 Notes. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6 ( Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d) for further discussion of the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes and the associated redemption of the 2022 Notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \nOur total capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, along with our estimated expenditures for 2020, by segment, are as follows:\nCorn and soybean are two major crops planted by farmers in the U.S. Corn crop has shown to deplete the amount of nitrogen and ammonia within the soil it is grown in, which in turn, results in a need for these nutrients to be replenished after each growing cycle. Unlike corn, soybean is able to obtain its own nitrogen through a process known as N fixation\u201d. As such, upon harvesting of soybean, the soil retains a certain amount of nitrogen which results in lower demand for nitrogen for the pursuing corn planting cycle. Due to these factors, nitrogen fertilizer consumers generally follow a balanced corn-soybean rotational planting cycle as evident through the chart presented below for 2018 and 2017. Due to the significant weather conditions discussed above, the 2019 planting cycle relied more heavily on corn planting to obtain sufficient crop harvests, which slightly adjusted this balance.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results\n(1)The Petroleum Segment's basis for determining inventory value under GAAP is First-In, First-Out ( FIFO\u201d). Changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices decrease. The inventory valuation impact is calculated based upon inventory values at the beginning of the accounting period and at the end of the accounting period. In order to derive the inventory valuation impact per total throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for the inventory valuation impact and divide by the number of total throughput barrels for the period.\nNYMEX WTI crude oil is an industry wide benchmark that is utilized in the market pricing of a barrel of crude oil. Other crude oils that are compared to WTI, known as differentials, show how the market for other crude oils such as WCS, White Cliffs ( Condensate\u201d), Brent Crude ( Brent\u201d), and Midland WTI ( Midland\u201d) are trending. During 2019, there were price fluctuations within these differentials due to the continued curtailments imposed by the Alberta government, therefore, tightening the WCS to WTI differential. Additionally, there have been start-up and line fill of new pipelines from West Texas to the Gulf Coast further tightening the domestic differentials against WTI.\n \n\n \nCVR Refining\nCapital Structure\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other was $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $14 million decrease was primarily a result of a $9 million gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal in the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease in project write-offs in 2019 compared to 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment Net Loss to EBITDA\n \nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the renewable fuel standards ( RFS\u201d) of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $100 to $110 million for 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of accelerated depreciation of certain assets, coupled with additions to property, plant, and equipment during the current year.\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery", "item_7_text": "results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. Our accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Our critical accounting policies, which are listed below, could materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Sales - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net sales increased by $53 million to $404 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to favorable pricing conditions which contributed $49 million in higher revenues coupled with increased sales volumes contributing $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Urea sales. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net sales included $33 million and $34 million in freight revenues, respectively, and $8 million and $8 million in other revenue, respectively.\n \nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\n \n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nAs a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we utilize the NYMEX and the Mid-Continent crack spreads. These crack spreads are a measure of the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in refining margins. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread is calculated using two barrels of WTI producing one barrel of NYMEX RBOB Gasoline ( RBOB\u201d) and one barrel of NYMEX NY Harbor ULSD ( HO\u201d). The Mid-Continent 2-1-1 crack spread is calculated using two barrels of WTI crude oil producing one barrel of Group 3 gasoline and one barrel of Group 3 diesel.\n \nThe following table presents distributions paid by CVR Partners to CVR Partners' unitholders, including amounts received by the Company, as of December 31, 2019.\n \n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nPetroleum Segment\nThe relationship between the total acres planted for both corn and soybean has a direct impact on the overall demand for UAN and ammonia products. As the number of corn\u201d acres increases, the market and demand for UAN and ammonia also increases. Correspondingly, as the number of soybean\u201d acres increases the market and demand for UAN and ammonia decreases.\n\n\ntime due to third-party operational constraints, and optimizing our commercial and marketing functions to maintain plant operations at their highest level.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section above for discussion of the changes made to the Company's definition of certain non-GAAP measures.\nOn January 27, 2020, CVR Energy issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025, (the 2025 Notes\u201d), which mature on February 15, 2025, and $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d), which mature on February 15, 2028. A portion of the net proceeds from the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes were used to fund the redemption of the 2022 Notes. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding (i) acquisitions, (ii) capital projects, and/or (iii) share repurchases or other distributions to our stockholders. Refer to Note 6 ( Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d) for further discussion of the issuance of these new notes and the redemption of the 2022 Notes.\n\u2022Integrity - We require high business ethics. We comply with the law and practice sound corporate governance. We only conduct business one way-the right way with integrity.\nIndustry Factors and Market Conditions\nThe earnings and cash flows of the Petroleum Segment are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into refined products. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the Petroleum Segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the Petroleum Segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the Petroleum Segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nCVR Energy\n(2)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $129 million, or 26.2% of income before income taxes, as compared to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $79 million, or 17.8% of income before income taxes. The fluctuation in income tax expense was due primarily to the decrease in non-controlling interest from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in non-controlling interest is due to the Company's January 29, 2019 purchase of all issued and outstanding CVR Refining common units not already owned by the Company. Refer to Note 1 ( Organization and Nature of Business\u201d) for a further discussion of this transaction. The effective income tax rate varies from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of the decrease in non-controlling interest and the benefits of state income tax credits.\nOverview - Petroleum Segment operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $574 million and $559 million, a $30 million and $48 million increase respectively over the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by higher refining margins and increased throughput volumes.\nNet sales for the Petroleum Segment decreased by $812 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate prices. However, the Petroleum Segment's EBITDA improved by $40 million from 2018 mainly due to decreased raw materials costs and favorable inventory impact.\nThe increase in UAN and ammonia sales pricing for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a shift in the timing of demand from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, as customers delayed receipt of nitrogen products due to continued inclement weather. As a result, customer demand for ammonia increased in the second quarter of 2019 as customers attempted to make up for the missed application. In addition, the aforementioned ammonia application, coupled with freezing temperatures and flooding throughout the Midwest and Southern Plains in 2019, shifted the demand for ammonia, resulting in increased sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Urea sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the turnaround at our East Dubuque Facility.\n \nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nStrategy and Goals\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating income and net income were $574 million and $559 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases of $30 million and $48 million, respectively, are driven primarily by higher refining margins when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Refining margin was $1,203 million, or $15.26 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,178 million, or $15.18 per throughput barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in refining margin of $25 million is primarily due to increased throughput volumes and lower RINs expense due to a reduction in market prices. Further, there was a gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal of $9 million (occurred in the second quarter of 2019), positively impacting the Petroleum Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment net sales increased by $53 million to $404\nPetroleum Segment\nMission and Core Values\n \nOur core values are driven by our people, inform the way we do business each and every day and enhance our ability to accomplish our mission and related strategic objectives.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 52\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report.

We foster accountability under a performance-driven culture that supports creative thinking, teamwork and personal development so that employees can realize their maximum potential. We use defined work practices for consistency, efficiency and to create value across the organization.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 51\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Petroleum Segment had a 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) and an Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. As discussed above, the Company redeemed all of the 2022 Notes in January 2020. Refer to Note 6 ( Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d) for further discussion.\nRefining Margin - Refining margin was $1,203 million, or $15.26 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,178 million, or $15.18 per throughput barrel, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased throughput volumes and lower RINs expense resulting from a reduction in market prices, partially offset by decreased gains on derivatives in the current period. Total throughput averaged 215,971 bpd for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 212,595 bpd for the same period in 2018. Derivative gains decreased by $127 million during 2019 compared to 2018.\nWithin the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization rates, and operating costs and expenses, including pet coke and natural gas feedstock costs.\n Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Petroleum coke used in production (thousand tons) 535 463 488 Petroleum coke (dollars per ton) $ 37.47 $ 28.41 $ 16.56 Natural gas used in production (thousands of MMBtu) (1) 6,856 7,933 7,620 Natural gas used in production (dollars per MMBtu) (1) $ 2.88 $ 3.28 $ 3.24 Natural gas cost of materials and other (thousands of MMBtu) (1) 6,961 7,122 8,052 Natural gas cost of materials and other (dollars per MMBtu) (1) $ 3.08 $ 3.15 $ 3.26 \nWe believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under CVR Partners' AB Credit Facility and CVR Refining's Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future operational performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nUtilization is presented solely on ammonia production, rather than each nitrogen product, as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of facility configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on ammonia upgrade capabilities, we believe this measure provides a meaningful view of how well we operate.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined within the previous sections of this Part II, Item 7, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\n\n(1)The feedstock natural gas shown above does not include natural gas used for fuel.

We are good neighbors and know that it's a privilege we can't take for granted. We seek to make a positive economic and social impact through our financial donations and the contributions of time, knowledge and talent of our employees to the places where we live and work.\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Gross Profit to Refining Margin and Refining Margin Adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impact\n \nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements\u201d as such term is defined within the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nReliability - Our goal is to achieve industry-leading utilization factors at our facilities through safe and reliable operations. We are focusing on improvements in day-to-day plant operations, identifying alternative sources for plant inputs to reduce lost\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 48\nDecember 31, 2019 | 45\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company revised its accounting policy method for the costs of planned major maintenance activities (turnarounds) specific to the Petroleum Segment from being expensed as incurred (the direct expensing method) to the deferral method. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d) for a further discussion of the impacts of this change in accounting policy. As a result of this change in accounting policy, the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Petroleum Adjusted EBITDA, Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Direct Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel net of Turnaround Expense are no longer being presented.\nWe divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment by month through December 31, 2019:\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced, that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.

The foundation of how we operate is built on five core values:\nOur principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying dividends to our stockholders, as further discussed below.\n(6)The amount includes environmental liabilities. Environmental liabilities represents our estimated payments required by federal and/or state environmental agencies. See Part I, Item 1, Environmental Matters.\u201d\n\n \nThe change in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $152 million, partially offset by a reduction in operating results, excluding non-cash items, of $22 million and unfavorable changes in non-current assets and liabilities of $11 million.\n \nAchievements\nDuring 2019, weather significantly impacted the demand for UAN and ammonia due to lack of extended dry conditions required for planting, caused by excessive rain delaying planting of corn and soybean crops. However, as a result of this delay, there was additional demand for UAN and ammonia due to the catch up from the late start to 2019 application season, but the fall season also had excessive moisture, which limited the ability to apply nitrogen. Consistent with the past 18 months,\n \nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 ( Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d), of this Report for a discussion of these, and other, accounting policies.\n \n\u2022Inventory finished goods valuation; and\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Partnership recognized a $6 million business interruption insurance recovery associated with an outage at its Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility during 2017.

If it's not safe, then we don't do it.\nThe tables below are presented, on a per barrel basis, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Direct Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel\nEast Dubuque Fertilizer Facility - During 2019, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 32 days and cost approximately $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. During 2017, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 14 days and incurred approximately $3 million in turnaround expense in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility experienced unplanned downtime totaling 12 days.\n \n \n\n\n\u2022Environment - We care for our environment. Complying with all regulations and minimizing any environmental impact from our operations is essential. We understand our obligation to the environment and that it's our duty to protect it.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nOn October 23, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program (the Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). The Stock Repurchase Program would enable the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company's common stock. Repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Program may be made from time-to-time through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing, price and amount of repurchases (if any) will be made at the discretion of management and are subject to market conditions as well as corporate, regulatory and other considerations. While the Stock Repurchase Program currently has a duration of four years, it does not obligate the Company to acquire any stock and may be terminated by the Company's Board of Directors at any time. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2019 Market Conditions\nLong-Term Commitments\n\n(4)The amount includes (i) commitments for petroleum products storage and petroleum transportation, (ii) electricity supply agreement, (iii) a product supply agreement, (iv) a pet coke supply agreement, (v) commitments related to our biofuels blending obligation, and (vi) various agreements for gas and gas transportation.\n(2)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the charts above, is illustrated below.\n\u2022Impairment of long-lived assets;\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Total Throughput Barrels\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure comparable across the fertilizer industry.\n(1)See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown below.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 43\nThe Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has a 9.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, 6.50% Senior Notes due 2021, and an AB Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 6 ( Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d) for further discussion.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 41\nThe following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales, excluding freight, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:\nThe following tables summarize the ammonia utilization at the Coffeyville and East Dubuque facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity adjusted for planned maintenance and turnarounds.\nCoffeyville Refinery - During the fourth quarter of 2019, our Coffeyville Refinery incurred costs of $15 million related to preparations for the planned turnaround scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2020. During the first quarter of 2018, our Coffeyville Refinery experienced an outage with its fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCCU\u201d) lasting 48 days. The FCCU outage had a significant negative impact on production and sales during that period.\nCoffeyville Fertilizer Facility - During 2018, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 15 days and incurred approximately $6 million in turnaround expense in the second quarter of 2018. During 2017, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility's third-party air separation unit experienced a shut down. Paired with this shut down and subsequent operational challenges, the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility experienced unplanned UAN downtime of 11 days during the second quarter of 2017.\nThe Partnership did not pay distributions during the year ended December 31, 2018, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, it paid a distribution of $0.02 per common unit, or $2 million. Of this distribution, CVR Energy received $1 million.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 63\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve should continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S. over the longer term.\nThe Petroleum Segment utilizes certain inputs within its refining operations. These inputs include crude oil, butanes, natural gasoline, ethanol, and bio-diesel (these are also known as throughputs\u201d).\nOn February 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 to the Company's stockholders of $0.80 per share, or $80 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be paid on March 9, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2020. IEP will receive approximately $57 million in respect of its ownership interest in the Company's shares.\n\u2022Income taxes;\nSegment Financial Highlights and Results of Operations\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document.\n \nDecember 31, 2019 | 59\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of net additions during the current year. Capitalization of turnaround expense along with adoption of ASC 842 also contributed to this increase.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA\n\nThe change in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to $301 million in funds used to acquire the remaining CVR Refining common units not otherwise owned by us, along with increases in CVR Energy dividends and CVR Partners distributions paid to public unitholders of $68 million and $30 million, respectively, compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in distributions to CVR Refining public unitholders of $93 million.\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 46\n(1)For December 2019, the average differentials for Midland and Condensate were $0.97 and $(0.15), respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid dividends totaling $2.50 and $2.00 per common unit, or $238 million and $174 million, respectively. Of these dividends, IEP received $179 million and $142 million, respectively, for the same periods.\nmillion as a result of favorable pricing and higher volumes. The increase in volumes was primarily attributable to a shift in demand from the fourth quarter 2018 to the second quarter of 2019 due to inclement weather.\nOur estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope, and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience unexpected changes in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer facilities. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 42\nPetroleum Segment\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other increased approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to asset write offs in the period contributing $3 million, coupled with increased personnel costs contributing $1 million.\n\n(1)Total 2020 estimated capitalized costs include approximately $45 to 55 million of growth related projects that will require additional approvals before commencement.\nCash Flows\nDecember 31, 2019 | 60\n\u2022Derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments;\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2019 relating to contractual obligations and other commercial commitments for the five-year period following December 31, 2019 and thereafter.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 62\n \nRefining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\n(3)Information used within these charts was obtained from MarketView.\nThis discussion and analysis generally discusses the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between such periods.

The next planned major turnaround within the Petroleum Segment is at the Coffeyville refinery commencing in the first quarter of 2020 with total estimated expenditures of $145 million to $155 million, of which $130 million to $140 million is expected to be incurred and capitalized in the spring of 2020. As to the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment, the East Dubuque facility began a major scheduled turnaround on September 14, 2019, which was completed in October. We incurred $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to this turnaround.\n \n\nThe following are non-GAAP measures we present for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n(1)On January 27, 2020, the Company redeemed all of the 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022 for a redemption price equal to 101.083%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redeemed notes.\nDecember 31, 2019 | 50\n \nOperating Activities\n \nThe presentation of our utilization is on a two-year rolling average which takes into account the impact of our planned and unplanned outages on any specific period.

Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6 ( Long-Term Debt and Finance Lease Obligations\u201d) for further discussion of the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes and the associated redemption of the 2022 Notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \nOur total capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, along with our estimated expenditures for 2020, by segment, are as follows:\nCorn and soybean are two major crops planted by farmers in the U.S. Corn crop has shown to deplete the amount of nitrogen and ammonia within the soil it is grown in, which in turn, results in a need for these nutrients to be replenished after each growing cycle. Unlike corn, soybean is able to obtain its own nitrogen through a process known as N fixation\u201d. As such, upon harvesting of soybean, the soil retains a certain amount of nitrogen which results in lower demand for nitrogen for the pursuing corn planting cycle. Due to these factors, nitrogen fertilizer consumers generally follow a balanced corn-soybean rotational planting cycle as evident through the chart presented below for 2018 and 2017. Due to the significant weather conditions discussed above, the 2019 planting cycle relied more heavily on corn planting to obtain sufficient crop harvests, which slightly adjusted this balance.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results\n(1)The Petroleum Segment's basis for determining inventory value under GAAP is First-In, First-Out ( FIFO\u201d). Changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices decrease. The inventory valuation impact is calculated based upon inventory values at the beginning of the accounting period and at the end of the accounting period. In order to derive the inventory valuation impact per total throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for the inventory valuation impact and divide by the number of total throughput barrels for the period.\nNYMEX WTI crude oil is an industry wide benchmark that is utilized in the market pricing of a barrel of crude oil. Other crude oils that are compared to WTI, known as differentials, show how the market for other crude oils such as WCS, White Cliffs ( Condensate\u201d), Brent Crude ( Brent\u201d), and Midland WTI ( Midland\u201d) are trending. During 2019, there were price fluctuations within these differentials due to the continued curtailments imposed by the Alberta government, therefore, tightening the WCS to WTI differential. Additionally, there have been start-up and line fill of new pipelines from West Texas to the Gulf Coast further tightening the domestic differentials against WTI.\n \n\n \nCVR Refining\nCapital Structure\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses, and Other - Selling, general and administrative expenses and other was $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $14 million decrease was primarily a result of a $9 million gain on the sale of the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil terminal in the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease in project write-offs in 2019 compared to 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment Net Loss to EBITDA\n \nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the renewable fuel standards ( RFS\u201d) of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $100 to $110 million for 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense - Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of accelerated depreciation of certain assets, coupled with additions to property, plant, and equipment during the current year.\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery", "item_7_tables": "Table 94:

"summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- The Petroleum Segment had higher operating income and net income in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by higher refining margins and increased throughput volumes. \n- The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment had a $15 million decrease in net loss and a $21 million increase in operating income in 2019 compared to 2018, due to increased sales volumes and pricing.\n\nPetroleum Segment\n- Refining margin was $1,203 million in 2019 compared to $1,178 million in 2018. Increase was due to higher throughput volumes and lower RINs expense.\n- Total throughput averaged 215,971 barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 compared to 212,595 bpd in 2018.\n\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment  \n- Net sales increased by $53 million to $404 million in 2019, due to favorable pricing conditions ($49 million) and increased sales volumes ($8 million).\n\nCapital Expenditures\n- Total capital expenditures were $114 million in 2019. Estimated expenditures are $133-150 million for 2020.\n\nCash Flows  \n- Cash from operations was $747 million in 2019 compared to $628 million in 2018. Increase was mainly due to favorable changes in working capital.\n\nFinancing\n- Cash used in financing activities was $642 million in 2019 compared to $334 million in 2018, primarily due to acquisition of CVR Refining common units, higher dividends, and CVR Partners distributions.\n\nThat's a high-level summary of some of the key operating and financial results and metrics covered in the report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
