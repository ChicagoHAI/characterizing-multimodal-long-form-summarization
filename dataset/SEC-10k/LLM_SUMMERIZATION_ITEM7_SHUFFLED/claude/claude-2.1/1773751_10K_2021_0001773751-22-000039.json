Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021, 2020, and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2021 to 2020 and 2020 to 2019. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in, or incorporated by reference into, the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date hereof or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.\nOverview\nHims & Hers, formerly known as Oaktree Acquisition Corp. ( OAC\u201d), is a direct-to-customer telehealth company incorporated in Delaware. Our mission is to make healthcare accessible, affordable, and convenient for everyone. Our proprietary websites, telehealth platform, electronic medical records system, and pharmacy integration combine to provide customers with a seamless, easy-to-use, digital-first experience. We are leading the transformation in healthcare by becoming the digital front door for healthcare consumers.\nWe believe the future of healthcare will be driven by consumer brands that empower people and give them full control over their healthcare. We have endeavored to build a healthcare model that squarely focuses on the needs of the healthcare consumer. To further our mission, we offer a range of health and wellness products and services available for purchase directly by customers on our websites and mobile application, and through wholesale partners.\nRevenue and Key Business Metrics\nOur management monitors two financial results, Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue (both defined below), to track our total revenue generation.\nOnline Revenue\u201d represents the sales of products and services on our platform, net of refunds, credits, and chargebacks, and includes revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), primarily relating to deferred revenue and returns reserve. Online Revenue is generated by selling directly to consumers through our websites. Our Online Revenue consists of products and services purchased by customers directly through our online platform. The majority of our Online Revenue is subscription-based, where customers agree to be billed on a recurring basis to have products and services automatically delivered to them.\nWholesale Revenue\u201d represents non-prescription product sales to retailers through wholesale purchasing agreements. We sell only non-prescription products to wholesale partners. In addition to being revenue generative and profitable, wholesale partnerships have the added benefit of generating brand awareness with new customers in physical environments.\nSubscriptions\u201d are defined as the number of customer agreements where the customer has agreed to be automatically billed on a recurring basis at a defined cadence. The billing cadence is typically defined as a number of months (for example, billed every month or every three months). Subscriptions are excluded from our reporting when payment has not occurred at the contracted billing cadence. Subscription billing is preferred by many of our customers because most of the products and services we make available treat chronic conditions and these product and service offerings are most effective when taken consistently and continuously. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and services and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products and services.\nNet Orders\u201d are defined as the number of online customer orders minus transactions related to refunds, credits, chargebacks, and other negative adjustments. Net Orders represent transactions made on our platform during a defined period of time and exclude revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP.\nAverage Order Value ( AOV\u201d) is defined as Online Revenue divided by Net Orders.\nWe monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe the following metrics are useful in evaluating our business. The table below provides a breakdown of total revenue between Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, as well as key metrics that drive Online Revenue (i.e., Net Orders, AOV, and Subscriptions), and the dollar and percentage change between such periods (in thousands, except for AOV):\nTable 6: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Revenue </td> <td>12,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,558 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Orders </td> <td>3,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AOV </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriptions </td> <td>609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>312 </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>190 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n(*)Not meaningful\nWe generated $259.2 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $118.4 million, or 84%, as compared to $140.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by growth in Subscriptions, AOV, Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL, which contributed $12.1 million of incremental revenue from the dates of their respective acquisitions. We generated $140.7 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $58.4 million, or 71%, compared to $82.3 million for year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by growth in Subscriptions and AOV. Although Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, this was more than offset by an increase in AOV, resulting in an overall increase in Online Revenue.\nWe generated $12.7 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.7 million, or 58%, as compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due to the addition of new retail partners in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased the overall volume of wholesale orders. We generated $8.0 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.8 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, we began selling to a large retailer, who continues to be a wholesale partner today.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, AOV was $74, an increase of 19% compared to $62 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As described further below, AOV growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by higher price points from larger product bundles and multi-month Subscriptions (which allow customers to receive two to twelve months of product in one order). For the year ended December 31, 2020, AOV was $62, an increase of 88% compared to $33 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in AOV was driven by an increased uptake of higher AOV offerings by customers, targeted acquisition of higher AOV new customers from marketing, and a reduction in discounts offered to customers.\nWe continuously test and optimize the online experience and offerings to improve the customer experience, maximize sales, and improve gross margin. In our subscription arrangements, customers select a cadence at which they wish to receive product shipments. In addition to a monthly cadence, we offer customers the ability to select from a range of shipment cadences, from every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed upon each shipment. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions at any time. In addition, our customers can purchase product bundles or defined product kits, either consisting of non-prescription over-the-counter products or non-prescription products together with prescription medications, for a single all-inclusive price. Such offerings and their uptake by customers have contributed to the expansion of AOV over time. Additionally, the uptake of these offerings have resulted in higher gross profits and gross margins. For example, for multi-month subscriptions, we may incur shipping and fulfillment expenses two or four times per year (for six-month and three-month subscription cadences, respectively) versus twelve times per year for monthly subscriptions. The customer uptake of multi-month subscriptions results in lower recurring costs and higher gross margins as compared to monthly subscriptions.\nSubscriptions grew 95% to approximately 609,000 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 312,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2020. Subscriptions grew 64% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately 190,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2019. Growth in Subscriptions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was driven by increased customer conversion rates from improved onsite and customer onboarding experiences, increased customer engagement with our marketing campaigns, increased retention rates of existing subscribers (also referred to as members\u201d), and in 2021, increased marketing expenses and the addition of Subscriptions from the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. As a result of growth in Subscriptions, we generated approximately 3.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 54% as compared to approximately 2.3 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 9% as compared to approximately 2.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due, in part, to the implementation of a strategy beginning in the third quarter of 2019 to acquire higher value and higher AOV customers and to enhance the customer experience with new offerings and subscription options. As we implemented this strategy, we reduced marketing expenses, and as a result, Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nKey Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges.\nNew customer acquisition\nOur ability to attract new customers is a key factor for our future growth. To date, we have successfully acquired new customers through marketing and the development of our brands and, recently, through acquisitions. As a result, revenue has increased each year since our launch. If we are unable to acquire enough new customers in the future, revenue might decline. New customer acquisition could be negatively impacted if our marketing efforts are less effective in the future. Increases in advertising rates could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers. Consumer tastes, preferences, and sentiment for our brands may also change and result in decreased demand for our products and services. Changes in law or regulatory enforcement could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers.\nRetention of customers\nOur ability to retain customers is a key factor in our ability to generate revenue. Most of our customers purchase products and services through subscription-based plans, where customers are billed and sent products and/or receive services on a recurring basis. The recurring nature of this revenue provides us with a certain amount of predictability for future revenue if past customer behavior stays consistent in the future. If customer behavior changes, and customer retention decreases in the future, then future revenue will be negatively impacted. The ability of our customers to continue to pay for our products and services will impact the future results of our operations.\nInvestments in growth\nWe expect to continue to focus on long-term growth through investments in product offerings and customer experience. We are working to enhance our offerings and expand the breadth of products and services offered on our websites. This includes near term investments in the ability to accept insurance on our platform for certain products or services and further development of\nmobile phone technology, including our recently launched mobile application. We expect to make significant investments in marketing to acquire new customers and we intend to continue to invest in our fulfillment and operating capabilities, including our own affiliated pharmacies and warehousing facilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in web and mobile technology to improve the customer experience on our platform. In the short term, we expect these investments to increase our operating expenses; however, in the long term, we anticipate that these investments will positively impact our results of operations. If we are unsuccessful at improving our offerings or are unable to generate additional demand for our offerings, we may not recover the financial investments we make into the business and revenue may not increase in the future.\nExpansion into new categories\nWe expect to expand into new categories with our offerings. Category expansion allows us to increase the number of customers for whom we can provide products and services. It also allows us to offer access to treatment of additional conditions that may already affect our current customers. Expanding into new categories will require financial investments in additional headcount, marketing and customer acquisition expenses, additional operational capabilities, and may require the purchase of new inventory. If we are unable to generate sufficient demand in new categories, we may not recover the financial investments we make into new categories and revenue may not increase in the future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance.\nHowever, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review net loss and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as net loss before depreciation and amortization, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of liabilities, one-time Merger bonuses and warrant expense, and acquisition-related costs, which include professional services and consideration paid for employee equity with vesting requirements incurred directly as a result of acquisitions.\nThe following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 7: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(107,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,114) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(72,064) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>4,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,136) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>(390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,901) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>67,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,802) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(951) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger bonuses </td> <td> </td> <td>5,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant expense in connection with Merger </td> <td> </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>8,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,114) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,099) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSome of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the U.S. GAAP items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not a substitute for, other financial performance measures, including our net loss and other U.S. GAAP results.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist, and we are closely monitoring its impact on all aspects of our business. We have a remote-first policy that permits most of our employees to work remotely should their particular positions allow, and we have taken measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing additional safety policies and procedures for employees working in our warehouse and Affiliated Pharmacies; suspending employee travel and in-person meetings prior to vaccination; and actively managing our fulfillment operations and inventory levels. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stockholders.\nOur financial condition and results of operations to date have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken by the federal, state, or local authorities (including vaccine mandates) and businesses affected, supply chain impacts, and the resulting economic impact may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial positions as well as our customers, suppliers, and partners. Widespread supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic have impacted businesses across multiple industries, including those in which we operate. If we experience delays or other challenges in obtaining supplies necessary for the production, fulfillment, or distribution of the products or services we offer, it could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our obligations to customers and maintain our operations in a cost-efficient manner and have a material adverse effect on our business. We will continue to monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its related resurgences and variants, and adjust our strategy accordingly.\nBasis of Presentation\nCurrently, we conduct business through one operating segment. Substantially all our long-lived assets are maintained in, and our losses are attributable to, the United States of America. Foreign operations are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. The variable interest entities are: (i) professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed healthcare providers that engage licensed clinical professionals to provide consultation services (i.e., the Affiliated Medical Groups); and (ii) XeCare and Apostrophe Pharmacy, each of which is a licensed mail order pharmacy providing prescription fulfillment services solely to our customers (i.e., the Affiliated Pharmacies). We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and the Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect these entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses. Under the variable interest entity model, we present the results of operations and the financial position of the entities as part of our consolidated financial statements as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, revenue is generated through wholesale arrangements.\nFor information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly attributable to the products shipped and services rendered, including product costs, packaging materials, shipping costs, and labor costs directly related to revenue generating activities. Costs related to free products, where there is no expectation of future purchases from a customer, are considered to be SG&A (as defined below) and are excluded from cost of revenue.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less our total cost of revenue, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the prices we charge for our products and services, the costs we incur from our vendors for certain components of our cost of revenues, the mix of the various products and services we sell in a period, the mix of Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue in a period, and our ability to sell our inventory. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period depending on these and other factors.\nMarketing expenses\nThe largest component of our marketing expenses consists of our discretionary customer acquisition costs. Customer acquisition costs are the advertising and media costs associated with our efforts to acquire new customers, promote our brands, and build awareness for our products and services. Customer acquisition costs include advertising in digital media, social media, television, radio, out-of-home media, and various other media outlets. Marketing expenses also include overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel; agency, contractor, and consulting expenses; content production, software, and other marketing operating costs. Marketing is an important driver of growth and we intend to continue to make significant investments in customer acquisition and our marketing organization. As a result, we\nexpect our marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future, although our marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period due to the timing and discretionary nature of these expenses.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) include the salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel for our executive, engineering, finance, supply chain management, and other administrative functions. SG&A also includes general operating expenses for professional services, third-party software and hosting, facilities, warehousing and fulfillment, customer service, payment processing, depreciation and amortization, and acquisition-related expenses. We expect SG&A to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase headcount with the growth of our business. We also expect SG&A to increase in the near term as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; and an increase in legal, audit, insurance, investor relations, professional services, and other administrative expenses. In addition, SG&A increases when we incur acquisition costs related to purchasing businesses. However, we anticipate SG&A to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the timing and amount of these expenses.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) primarily consists of the change in fair value of warrant and earn-out liabilities, as well as interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and investment accounts. Additionally, other income (expense) includes non-operating and one-time charges classified outside of operating expenses, and interest expense related to our past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution, which have been paid in full.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nThe income tax benefit (provision) primarily consists of a partial release in valuation allowance in 2021, as well as state taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates.\nResults of Operations\nComparisons for the years ended

of $123.1 million, or 83%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. Revenue was $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $66.2 million, or 80%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. For detailed discussion of these increases, refer to -Revenue and Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nCost of revenue was $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $28.1 million, or 71%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 94%, increased shipping costs of 54%, and increased costs associated with medical consultation services of 43%. The product, packaging, and shipping costs increases were due to overall increased business activity, growth of Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. Costs associated with medical consultation services are a product of the number of consultations and the cost per consultation. While the number of consultations increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced the cost per consultation during that year by implementing more efficient payment programs, resulting in a decrease in medical consultation services costs in relation to overall revenue growth.\nCost of revenue was $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.4 million, or 4%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 27%, which were offset by decreased costs associated with medical consultation services of 18% and decreased shipping costs of 5%. The number of consultations and the cost per consultation both declined for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGross profit was $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $95.0 million or 87%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from higher growth in revenue as compared to growth in variable costs, such as shipping costs and those associated with medical consultation services, partially offset by the impact of the operations of Apostrophe and HHL.\nGross profit was $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.8 million or 145%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of a proportionately lower increase in cost of revenue than the increase in revenue.\nMarketing expenses\nMarketing expenses were $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $76.9 million or 130%. The most significant component of marketing expenses is customer acquisition costs, which increased to $99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $55.1 million or 125%. The increase in customer acquisition costs was partially a result of management's decision to increase investment in display, search, and television marketing, as we continue to identify opportunities to drive new customer growth, as well as the customer acquisition costs we incurred following the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL.\nMarketing expenses were $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.2 million or 7%. Customer acquisition costs decreased to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $7.6 million or 15%. Management decided to reduce customer acquisition costs in 2020 in order to focus on acquiring higher AOV customers for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other marketing expenses, such as salaries and wages, and related benefits due to an increase in marketing-related headcount.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses were $183.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $118.0 million or 180%. The largest single component of the increase in SG&A was an increase in stock-based compensation expense to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.9 million. Most of the increase in stock-based compensation was a result of expenses related to the earn-out consideration issued as part of the Merger, as well as the recognition of expense related to stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer and vesting of restricted stock units, both of which were contingent upon the achievement of a liquidity event that was satisfied upon the closing of the Merger. All of these resulted in either one-time expenses or cumulative catch-up expense as a result of the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred $5.2 million of bonus expense as a result of the previously disclosed one-time transaction bonuses related to the Merger.\nExcluding stock-based compensation and Merger bonuses, employee compensation expense was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $22.1 million or 115%. Furthermore, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in SG&A was due to an $8.5 million increase in professional services as a result of overall increased business activity and compliance requirements associated with being a public company, a $7.5 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and technology costs, a $7.1 million increase in insurance premiums as a result of becoming a public entity, $6.9 million of fees incurred for acquisitions, a $6.0 million increase in order fulfillment, warehouse, selling, and processing costs, and $1.6 million of product development costs.\nSG&A expenses were $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.7 million or 17%. The increase in SG&A was driven by an increase in salaries and wages, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation expense to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, in 2020, consulting expenses related to professional services increased to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the Merger. In July 2020, we ceased use of our headquarters office facility and other offices, recording a lease termination fee of $1.4 million. In January 2020, we also entered into a new operating lease arrangement for a warehouse space in New Albany, Ohio, which contributed to an increase in rent expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense), net, was $4.2 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $7.1 million. The change was driven primarily by a gain from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3.8 million compared to a loss from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.1 million.\nOther income (expense), net, was $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.4 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $5.3 million. The change was driven primarily by a 2020 increase in the fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability as compared to a 2019 decrease in the fair value of this liability.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nThe benefit for income taxes was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in tax expense was primarily due to the partial release of valuation allowance totaling $3.1 million as a result of the tax liability recorded for the Apostrophe acquisition, serving as a source of income for existing tax assets.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily attributable to state taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through the Merger, we financed our operations primarily from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $71.8 million, which are invested in money market funds and government bonds, and investments in the amount of $175.5 million, which are invested in corporate, government, and asset-backed bonds.\nWe have historically incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses at least for the next 12 months due to the investments that we intend to make in our business. We believe our existing cash resources and funds raised from the closing of the Merger are sufficient to support planned operations for the next 12 months. As a result, management believes that our current financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the number of orders we receive, the size of our customer base, the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales, marketing and development activities, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We completed two acquisitions in 2021, and expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed. In order to support the growth of our business, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or seek capital through new equity or debt financings, which sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flow data (in thousands):\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34,412) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,479) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74,867) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(156,268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,701) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,299) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>235,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,318 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nOur largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities includes costs of revenue, marketing expenses and personnel-related expenditures to support the growth of our business.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $107.7 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $67.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, net amortization on securities of $2.2 million, non-cash operating lease cost of $1.5 million, and non-cash acquisition-related costs of $1.2 million. Non-cash expense was partially offset by non-cash income of $3.8 million related to the change in fair value of liabilities and benefit for deferred taxes of $3.4 million. In addition, a net cash inflow totaling $3.5 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $10.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $3.2 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.4 million. This inflow was partially offset by an increase in inventory of $9.6 million and a change in operating lease liabilities of $1.5 million since adoption of the new lease standard. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in cash used in operating activities reflects investment in business growth, including investment in direct marketing, personnel-related expenditures, and supply chain management.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $18.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $5.8 million, non-cash losses for change in fair value of preferred stock warrants totaling $3.1 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $1.1 million, lease termination costs of $0.8 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.3 million. In addition, a cash inflow totaling $4.2 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.2 million, a decrease in inventory of $0.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million, and an increase in other long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the improving leverage, after excluding certain non-cash expenses, from increased revenues, while reducing cost of revenue and marketing expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The most significant component of our cash used during this period was a net loss of $72.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $8.0 million and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.3 million. This was partially offset by non-cash gains for change in fair value of Series C preferred stock warrants totaling $1.0 million and non-cash other income totaling $0.2 million. In addition, a cash outflow totaling $9.9 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.4 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.4 million, an increase in other long-term assets of $0.8 million, and an increase in inventory of $0.5 million. This outflow was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $0.2 million.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our treasury operations of investing in available-for-sale investments, as well as investment in acquisitions, website development, and internal-use software and purchase of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $156.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $104.8 million, as well as acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $46.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $4.2 million including investment in our mobile technology, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $0.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $39.7 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $35.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $2.5 million, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $1.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $39.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $37.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $1.5 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $0.3 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $235.0 million, which was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock as a result of the Merger of $197.7 million, proceeds from the PIPE Investment (as defined in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $75.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options of $2.0 million, and proceeds received from employee repayment of promissory notes of $1.2 million. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments related to pre-closing stock repurchase of $22.0 million, Merger transaction costs of $12.9 million, and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $6.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $47.7 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $51.9 million. Proceeds from exercise of warrants and stock options provided cash inflow totaling $0.7 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by Merger transaction costs of $3.4 million and term loan repayments of $1.5 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.3 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $102.6 million, and term loan borrowings of $2.1 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by term loan repayments of $9.1 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any borrowing arrangements and there are no outstanding borrowings. All past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution have been paid in full. Refer to Note 13 - Borrowing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of past borrowing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commitments include earn-out payables and earn-out liabilities related to acquisitions, operating leases, and non-cancelable purchase obligations primarily related to cloud-based software contracts used in operations. Total contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 were $53.6 million, of which $46.2 million was payable within 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider forming a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are the policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue recognition\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products and services through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, we offer a range of health and wellness products through wholesale partners.\nFor Online Revenue, we define our customer as an individual who purchases products or services through websites. For Wholesale Revenue, we define our customer as a wholesale partner. The transaction price in our contracts with customers is the total amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer.\nOur contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation include two performance obligations: access to (i) products and (ii) consultation services. Our contracts for prescription refills and contracts that do not contain prescription products have a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product to the customer and, in contracts that contain services, by the provision of consultation services to the customer. We satisfy our performance obligation for products at a point in time, which is upon delivery of the products to a third-party carrier. We satisfy our performance obligation for services over the period of the consultation service, which is typically a few days. The customer obtains control of the products and services upon our completion of our performance obligations.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price is based on the prices at which we separately sell the products and services, as well as market and cost-plus estimates.\nTo fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include professional medical consultations, we maintain relationships with various Affiliated Medical Groups, which are professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and mental health providers; collectively referred to as Providers\u201d or individually, a Provider\u201d) to provide consultation services. We account for service revenue as a principal in the arrangement with our customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) we determine which Affiliated Medical Group and Provider provides the consultation to the customer; (ii) we are primarily responsible for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the services; (iii) we incur costs for consultation services even for visits that do not result in a prescription and the sale of products; and (iv) we, at our sole discretion, set all listed prices charged on our websites for products and services.\nAdditionally, to fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include sale of prescription products, we maintain relationships with certain affiliated and third-party pharmacies ( Partner Pharmacies\u201d or individually, a Partner Pharmacy\u201d) to fill prescriptions that are ordered by our customers for fulfillment through our websites. We account for prescription product revenue as a principal in the arrangement with our customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) we have sole discretion in determining which Partner Pharmacy fills a customer's prescription; (ii) Partner Pharmacies fill the prescription based on fulfillment instructions provided by us, including using our branded packaging for generic products; (iii) we are primarily responsible to the customer for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the order; (iv) we are responsible for refunds of the prescription medication after transfer of control to the customer; and (v) we, at our sole discretion, set all listed prices charged on our websites for products and services.\nWe estimate refunds using the expected value method based on historical refunds granted to customers. We update our estimate at the end of each reporting period and recognize the estimated amount as contra-revenue with a corresponding refund liability. Sales, value-added, and other taxes are excluded from the transaction price and, therefore, from revenue.\nWe account for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control of a product has been transferred to the customer, in cost of revenue.\nFor online sales, payment for prescription medication and non-prescription products is typically collected from the customer a few days in advance of product shipment. Contract liabilities are recorded when payments have been received from the customer for undelivered products or services and are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are later satisfied. Contract liabilities consisting of balances related to customer prepayments are recognized as current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets since the associated revenue will be primarily recognized within the following month. For wholesale arrangements, payments are collected in accordance with contract terms.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities\nU.S. GAAP requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if an entity is the primary beneficiary. Under the variable interest model, the primary beneficiary is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the variable interest entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.\nWe determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses.\nWe perform ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies would cause our consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the variable interest entities with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP.\nBusiness combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is attributed to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nWhen we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders, we evaluate whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company's stockholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions, and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, we may engage a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations.", "item_7_truncated": "The following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the dollar and percentage change

relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021, 2020, and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2021 to 2020 and 2020 to 2019. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in, or incorporated by reference into, the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date hereof or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.\nWe generated $12.7 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.7 million, or 58%, as compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due to the addition of new retail partners in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased the overall volume of wholesale orders. We generated $8.0 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.8 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, we began selling to a large retailer, who continues to be a wholesale partner today.\n\nWe monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe the following metrics are useful in evaluating our business. The table below provides a breakdown of total revenue between Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, as well as key metrics that drive Online Revenue (i.e., Net Orders, AOV, and Subscriptions), and the dollar and percentage change between such periods (in thousands, except for AOV):\nTable 7: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(107,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,114) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(72,064) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>4,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,136) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>(390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,901) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>67,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,802) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(951) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger bonuses </td> <td> </td> <td>5,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warrant expense in connection with Merger </td> <td> </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>8,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,114) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,099) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to retain customers is a key factor in our ability to generate revenue. Most of our customers purchase products and services through subscription-based plans, where customers are billed and sent products and/or receive services on a recurring basis. The recurring nature of this revenue provides us with a certain amount of predictability for future revenue if past customer behavior stays consistent in the future. If customer behavior changes, and customer retention decreases in the future, then future revenue will be negatively impacted. The ability of our customers to continue to pay for our products and services will impact the future results of our operations.\nFrom inception through the Merger, we financed our operations primarily from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $71.8 million, which are invested in money market funds and government bonds, and investments in the amount of $175.5 million, which are invested in corporate, government, and asset-backed bonds.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nBusiness combinations\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(90) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(41) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (provision) for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include professional medical consultations, we maintain relationships with various Affiliated Medical Groups, which are professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and mental health providers; collectively referred to as Providers\u201d or individually, a Provider\u201d) to provide consultation services.

The largest single component of the increase in SG&A was an increase in stock-based compensation expense to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.9 million. Most of the increase in stock-based compensation was a result of expenses related to the earn-out consideration issued as part of the Merger, as well as the recognition of expense related to stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer and vesting of restricted stock units, both of which were contingent upon the achievement of a liquidity event that was satisfied upon the closing of the Merger. All of these resulted in either one-time expenses or cumulative catch-up expense as a result of the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred $5.2 million of bonus expense as a result of the previously disclosed one-time transaction bonuses related to the Merger.\nWe determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist, and we are closely monitoring its impact on all aspects of our business. We have a remote-first policy that permits most of our employees to work remotely should their particular positions allow, and we have taken measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing additional safety policies and procedures for employees working in our warehouse and Affiliated Pharmacies; suspending employee travel and in-person meetings prior to vaccination; and actively managing our fulfillment operations and inventory levels. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stockholders.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $18.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $5.8 million, non-cash losses for change in fair value of preferred stock warrants totaling $3.1 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $1.1 million, lease termination costs of $0.8 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.3 million. In addition, a cash inflow totaling $4.2 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.2 million, a decrease in inventory of $0.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million, and an increase in other long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the improving leverage, after excluding certain non-cash expenses, from increased revenues, while reducing cost of revenue and marketing expenses.\nOnline Revenue\u201d represents the sales of products and services on our platform, net of refunds, credits, and chargebacks, and includes revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), primarily relating to deferred revenue and returns reserve. Online Revenue is generated by selling directly to consumers through our websites. Our Online Revenue consists of products and services purchased by customers directly through our online platform. The majority of our Online Revenue is subscription-based, where customers agree to be billed on a recurring basis to have products and services automatically delivered to them.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, AOV was $74, an increase of 19% compared to $62 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As described further below, AOV growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by higher price points from larger product bundles and multi-month Subscriptions (which allow customers to receive two to twelve months of product in one order). For the year ended December 31, 2020, AOV was $62, an increase of 88% compared to $33 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in AOV was driven by an increased uptake of higher AOV offerings by customers, targeted acquisition of higher AOV new customers from marketing, and a reduction in discounts offered to customers.\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly attributable to the products shipped and services rendered, including product costs, packaging materials, shipping costs, and labor costs directly related to revenue generating activities. Costs related to free products, where there is no expectation of future purchases from a customer, are considered to be SG&A (as defined below) and are excluded from cost of revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The most significant component of our cash used during this period was a net loss of $72.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $8.0 million and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.3 million. This was partially offset by non-cash gains for change in fair value of Series C preferred stock warrants totaling $1.0 million and non-cash other income totaling $0.2 million. In addition, a cash outflow totaling $9.9 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.4 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.4 million, an increase in other long-term assets of $0.8 million, and an increase in inventory of $0.5 million. This outflow was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $0.2 million.\nWe expect to expand into new categories with our offerings. Category expansion allows us to increase the number of customers for whom we can provide products and services. It also allows us to offer access to treatment of additional conditions that may already affect our current customers. Expanding into new categories will require financial investments in additional headcount, marketing and customer acquisition expenses, additional operational capabilities, and may require the purchase of new inventory. If we are unable to generate sufficient demand in new categories, we may not recover the financial investments we make into new categories and revenue may not increase in the future.\nAdditionally, to fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include sale of prescription products, we maintain relationships with certain affiliated and third-party pharmacies ( Partner Pharmacies\u201d or individually, a Partner Pharmacy\u201d) to fill prescriptions that are ordered by our customers for fulfillment through our websites. We account for prescription product revenue as a principal in the arrangement with our customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) we have sole discretion in determining which Partner Pharmacy fills a customer's prescription; (ii) Partner Pharmacies fill the prescription based on fulfillment instructions provided by us, including using our branded packaging for generic products; (iii) we are primarily responsible to the customer for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the order; (iv) we are responsible for refunds of the prescription medication after transfer of control to the customer; and (v) we, at our sole discretion, set all listed prices charged on our websites for products and services.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our treasury operations of investing in available-for-sale investments, as well as investment in acquisitions, website development, and internal-use software and purchase of property and equipment.\nNet Orders\u201d are defined as the number of online customer orders minus transactions related to refunds, credits, chargebacks, and other negative adjustments. Net Orders represent transactions made on our platform during a defined period of time and exclude revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP.\nAverage Order Value ( AOV\u201d) is defined as Online Revenue divided by Net Orders.\nWe believe the future of healthcare will be driven by consumer brands that empower people and give them full control over their healthcare. We have endeavored to build a healthcare model that squarely focuses on the needs of the healthcare consumer. To further our mission, we offer a range of health and wellness products and services available for purchase directly by customers on our websites and mobile application, and through wholesale partners.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor online sales, payment for prescription medication and non-prescription products is typically collected from the customer a few days in advance of product shipment. Contract liabilities are recorded when payments have been received from the customer for undelivered products or services and are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are later satisfied. Contract liabilities consisting of balances related to customer prepayments are recognized as current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets since the associated revenue will be primarily recognized within the following month. For wholesale arrangements, payments are collected in accordance with contract terms.\nCost of revenue was $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $28.1 million, or 71%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 94%, increased shipping costs of 54%, and increased costs associated with medical consultation services of 43%. The product, packaging, and shipping costs increases were due to overall increased business activity, growth of Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. Costs associated with medical consultation services are a product of the number of consultations and the cost per consultation. While the number of consultations increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced the cost per consultation during that year by implementing more efficient payment programs, resulting in a decrease in medical consultation services costs in relation to overall revenue growth.\nOur largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities includes costs of revenue, marketing expenses and personnel-related expenditures to support the growth of our business.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWhen we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders, we evaluate whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company's stockholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price is based on the prices at which we separately sell the products and services, as well as market and cost-plus estimates.\nGross profit was $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $95.0 million or 87%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from higher growth in revenue as compared to growth in variable costs, such as shipping costs and those associated with medical consultation services, partially offset by the impact of the operations of Apostrophe and HHL.\nOther income (expense)\nMarketing expenses were $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.2 million or 7%. Customer acquisition costs decreased to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $7.6 million or 15%. Management decided to reduce customer acquisition costs in 2020 in order to focus on acquiring higher AOV customers for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other marketing expenses, such as salaries and wages, and related benefits due to an increase in marketing-related headcount.\nmobile phone technology, including our recently launched mobile application. We expect to make significant investments in marketing to acquire new customers and we intend to continue to invest in our fulfillment and operating capabilities, including our own affiliated pharmacies and warehousing facilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in web and mobile technology to improve the customer experience on our platform. In the short term, we expect these investments to increase our operating expenses; however, in the long term, we anticipate that these investments will positively impact our results of operations. If we are unsuccessful at improving our offerings or are unable to generate additional demand for our offerings, we may not recover the financial investments we make into the business and revenue may not increase in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any borrowing arrangements and there are no outstanding borrowings. All past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution have been paid in full. Refer to Note 13 - Borrowing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of past borrowing arrangements.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flow data (in thousands):\nCost of revenue was $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.4 million, or 4%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 27%, which were offset by decreased costs associated with medical consultation services of 18% and decreased shipping costs of 5%. The number of consultations and the cost per consultation both declined for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther income (expense), net, was $4.2 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $7.1 million. The change was driven primarily by a gain from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3.8 million compared to a loss from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.1 million.\nIn addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nRevenue\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $47.7 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $51.9 million. Proceeds from exercise of warrants and stock options provided cash inflow totaling $0.7 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by Merger transaction costs of $3.4 million and term loan repayments of $1.5 million.\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less our total cost of revenue, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the prices we charge for our products and services, the costs we incur from our vendors for certain components of our cost of revenues, the mix of the various products and services we sell in a period, the mix of Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue in a period, and our ability to sell our inventory. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period depending on these and other factors.\nWe generated $259.2 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $118.4 million, or 84%, as compared to $140.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by growth in Subscriptions, AOV, Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL, which contributed $12.1 million of incremental revenue from the dates of their respective acquisitions. We generated $140.7 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $58.4 million, or 71%, compared to $82.3 million for year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by growth in Subscriptions and AOV. Although Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, this was more than offset by an increase in AOV, resulting in an overall increase in Online Revenue.\nOther income (expense), net, was $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.4 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $5.3 million. The change was driven primarily by a 2020 increase in the fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability as compared to a 2019 decrease in the fair value of this liability.\nWe have historically incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses at least for the next 12 months due to the investments that we intend to make in our business. We believe our existing cash resources and funds raised from the closing of the Merger are sufficient to support planned operations for the next 12 months. As a result, management believes that our current financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe largest component of our marketing expenses consists of our discretionary customer acquisition costs. Customer acquisition costs are the advertising and media costs associated with our efforts to acquire new customers, promote our brands, and build awareness for our products and services. Customer acquisition costs include advertising in digital media, social media, television, radio, out-of-home media, and various other media outlets. Marketing expenses also include overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel; agency, contractor, and consulting expenses; content production, software, and other marketing operating costs. Marketing is an important driver of growth and we intend to continue to make significant investments in customer acquisition and our marketing organization. As a result, we\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $156.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $104.8 million, as well as acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $46.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $4.2 million including investment in our mobile technology, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $0.8 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $107.7 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $67.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, net amortization on securities of $2.2 million, non-cash operating lease cost of $1.5 million, and non-cash acquisition-related costs of $1.2 million. Non-cash expense was partially offset by non-cash income of $3.8 million related to the change in fair value of liabilities and benefit for deferred taxes of $3.4 million. In addition, a net cash inflow totaling $3.5 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $10.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $3.2 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.4 million. This inflow was partially offset by an increase in inventory of $9.6 million and a change in operating lease liabilities of $1.5 million since adoption of the new lease standard. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in cash used in operating activities reflects investment in business growth, including investment in direct marketing, personnel-related expenditures, and supply chain management.\nWholesale Revenue\u201d represents non-prescription product sales to retailers through wholesale purchasing agreements. We sell only non-prescription products to wholesale partners. In addition to being revenue generative and profitable, wholesale partnerships have the added benefit of generating brand awareness with new customers in physical environments.\nSome of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the U.S. GAAP items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not a substitute for, other financial performance measures, including our net loss and other U.S. GAAP results.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe expect to continue to focus on long-term growth through investments in product offerings and customer experience. We are working to enhance our offerings and expand the breadth of products and services offered on our websites. This includes near term investments in the ability to accept insurance on our platform for certain products or services and further development of\nCash Flows\nKey Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nCost of revenue and gross profit\n(*)Not meaningful\nOverview\nThe following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\nSubscriptions\u201d are defined as the number of customer agreements where the customer has agreed to be automatically billed on a recurring basis at a defined cadence. The billing cadence is typically defined as a number of months (for example, billed every month or every three months). Subscriptions are excluded from our reporting when payment has not occurred at the contracted billing cadence. Subscription billing is preferred by many of our customers because most of the products and services we make available treat chronic conditions and these product and service offerings are most effective when taken consistently and continuously. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and services and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products and services.\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products and services through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, we offer a range of health and wellness products through wholesale partners.\nSG&A expenses were $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.7 million or 17%. The increase in SG&A was driven by an increase in salaries and wages, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation expense to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, in 2020, consulting expenses related to professional services increased to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the Merger. In July 2020, we ceased use of our headquarters office facility and other offices, recording a lease termination fee of $1.4 million. In January 2020, we also entered into a new operating lease arrangement for a warehouse space in New Albany, Ohio, which contributed to an increase in rent expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nHims & Hers, formerly known as Oaktree Acquisition Corp. ( OAC\u201d), is a direct-to-customer telehealth company incorporated in Delaware. Our mission is to make healthcare accessible, affordable, and convenient for everyone. Our proprietary websites, telehealth platform, electronic medical records system, and pharmacy integration combine to provide customers with a seamless, easy-to-use, digital-first experience. We are leading the transformation in healthcare by becoming the digital front door for healthcare consumers.\nGross profit was $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.8 million or 145%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of a proportionately lower increase in cost of revenue than the increase in revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented:\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $39.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $37.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $1.5 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $0.3 million.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions, and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, we may engage a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations.\nNew customer acquisition\nU.S. GAAP requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if an entity is the primary beneficiary. Under the variable interest model, the primary beneficiary is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the variable interest entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.\n\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nOur ability to attract new customers is a key factor for our future growth. To date, we have successfully acquired new customers through marketing and the development of our brands and, recently, through acquisitions. As a result, revenue has increased each year since our launch. If we are unable to acquire enough new customers in the future, revenue might decline. New customer acquisition could be negatively impacted if our marketing efforts are less effective in the future. Increases in advertising rates could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers. Consumer tastes, preferences, and sentiment for our brands may also change and result in decreased demand for our products and services. Changes in law or regulatory enforcement could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers.\nExpansion into new categories\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n______________\nOther income (expense)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as net loss before depreciation and amortization, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of liabilities, one-time Merger bonuses and warrant expense, and acquisition-related costs, which include professional services and consideration paid for employee equity with vesting requirements incurred directly as a result of acquisitions.\nIndebtedness\nCash flows from operating activities\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n ______________\n\n(*)Not meaningful\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the number of orders we receive, the size of our customer base, the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales, marketing and development activities, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We completed two acquisitions in 2021, and expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed. In order to support the growth of our business, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or seek capital through new equity or debt financings, which sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nMarketing expenses\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, revenue is generated through wholesale arrangements.\nWe continuously test and optimize the online experience and offerings to improve the customer experience, maximize sales, and improve gross margin. In our subscription arrangements, customers select a cadence at which they wish to receive product shipments. In addition to a monthly cadence, we offer customers the ability to select from a range of shipment cadences, from every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed upon each shipment. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions at any time. In addition, our customers can purchase product bundles or defined product kits, either consisting of non-prescription over-the-counter products or non-prescription products together with prescription medications, for a single all-inclusive price. Such offerings and their uptake by customers have contributed to the expansion of AOV over time. Additionally, the uptake of these offerings have resulted in higher gross profits and gross margins. For example, for multi-month subscriptions, we may incur shipping and fulfillment expenses two or four times per year (for six-month and three-month subscription cadences, respectively) versus twelve times per year for monthly subscriptions. The customer uptake of multi-month subscriptions results in lower recurring costs and higher gross margins as compared to monthly subscriptions.\nCurrently, we conduct business through one operating segment. Substantially all our long-lived assets are maintained in, and our losses are attributable to, the United States of America. Foreign operations are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. The variable interest entities are: (i) professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed healthcare providers that engage licensed clinical professionals to provide consultation services (i.e., the Affiliated Medical Groups); and (ii) XeCare and Apostrophe Pharmacy, each of which is a licensed mail order pharmacy providing prescription fulfillment services solely to our customers (i.e., the Affiliated Pharmacies). We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and the Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect these entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses. Under the variable interest entity model, we present the results of operations and the financial position of the entities as part of our consolidated financial statements as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are the policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is attributed to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) include the salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel for our executive, engineering, finance, supply chain management, and other administrative functions. SG&A also includes general operating expenses for professional services, third-party software and hosting, facilities, warehousing and fulfillment, customer service, payment processing, depreciation and amortization, and acquisition-related expenses. We expect SG&A to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase headcount with the growth of our business. We also expect SG&A to increase in the near term as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; and an increase in legal, audit, insurance, investor relations, professional services, and other administrative expenses. In addition, SG&A increases when we incur acquisition costs related to purchasing businesses. However, we anticipate SG&A to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the timing and amount of these expenses.\nOur financial condition and results of operations to date have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken by the federal, state, or local authorities (including vaccine mandates) and businesses affected, supply chain impacts, and the resulting economic impact may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial positions as well as our customers, suppliers, and partners. Widespread supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic have impacted businesses across multiple industries, including those in which we operate. If we experience delays or other challenges in obtaining supplies necessary for the production, fulfillment, or distribution of the products or services we offer, it could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our obligations to customers and maintain our operations in a cost-efficient manner and have a material adverse effect on our business. We will continue to monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its related resurgences and variants, and adjust our strategy accordingly.\nRevenue was $271.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $123.1 million, or 83%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. Revenue was $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $66.2 million, or 80%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. For detailed discussion of these increases, refer to -Revenue and Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nGross profit and gross margin\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.3 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $102.6 million, and term loan borrowings of $2.1 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by term loan repayments of $9.1 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million.\nRetention of customers\nSubscriptions grew 95% to approximately 609,000 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 312,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2020. Subscriptions grew 64% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately 190,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2019. Growth in Subscriptions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was driven by increased customer conversion rates from improved onsite and customer onboarding experiences, increased customer engagement with our marketing campaigns, increased retention rates of existing subscribers (also referred to as members\u201d), and in 2021, increased marketing expenses and the addition of Subscriptions from the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. As a result of growth in Subscriptions, we generated approximately 3.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 54% as compared to approximately 2.3 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 9% as compared to approximately 2.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due, in part, to the implementation of a strategy beginning in the third quarter of 2019 to acquire higher value and higher AOV customers and to enhance the customer experience with new offerings and subscription options. As we implemented this strategy, we reduced marketing expenses, and as a result, Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nComparisons for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nWe account for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control of a product has been transferred to the customer, in cost of revenue.\nexpect our marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future, although our marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period due to the timing and discretionary nature of these expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nInvestments in growth\nFor information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation include two performance obligations: access to (i) products and (ii) consultation services. Our contracts for prescription refills and contracts that do not contain prescription products have a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product to the customer and, in contracts that contain services, by the provision of consultation services to the customer. We satisfy our performance obligation for products at a point in time, which is upon delivery of the products to a third-party carrier. We satisfy our performance obligation for services over the period of the consultation service, which is typically a few days. The customer obtains control of the products and services upon our completion of our performance obligations.\nWe perform ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies would cause our consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the variable interest entities with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP.\nOur contractual obligations and commitments include earn-out payables and earn-out liabilities related to acquisitions, operating leases, and non-cancelable purchase obligations primarily related to cloud-based software contracts used in operations. Total contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 were $53.6 million, of which $46.2 million was payable within 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily attributable to state taxes.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nOther income (expense) primarily consists of the change in fair value of warrant and earn-out liabilities, as well as interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and investment accounts. Additionally, other income (expense) includes non-operating and one-time charges classified outside of operating expenses, and interest expense related to our past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution, which have been paid in full.\nRevenue recognition\nMarketing expenses\nBasis of Presentation\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $235.0 million, which was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock as a result of the Merger of $197.7 million, proceeds from the PIPE Investment (as defined in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $75.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options of $2.0 million, and proceeds received from employee repayment of promissory notes of $1.2 million. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments related to pre-closing stock repurchase of $22.0 million, Merger transaction costs of $12.9 million, and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $6.0 million.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $39.7 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $35.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $2.5 million, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $1.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nHowever, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review net loss and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe income tax benefit (provision) primarily consists of a partial release in valuation allowance in 2021, as well as state taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates.\nFor Online Revenue, we define our customer as an individual who purchases products or services through websites. For Wholesale Revenue, we define our customer as a wholesale partner. The transaction price in our contracts with customers is the total amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider forming a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur management monitors two financial results, Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue (both defined below), to track our total revenue generation.\nExcluding stock-based compensation and Merger bonuses, employee compensation expense was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $22.1 million or 115%. Furthermore, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in SG&A was due to an $8.5 million increase in professional services as a result of overall increased business activity and compliance requirements associated with being a public company, a $7.5 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and technology costs, a $7.1 million increase in insurance premiums as a result of becoming a public entity, $6.9 million of fees incurred for acquisitions, a $6.0 million increase in order fulfillment, warehouse, selling, and processing costs, and $1.6 million of product development costs.\nMarketing expenses were $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $76.9 million or 130%. The most significant component of marketing expenses is customer acquisition costs, which increased to $99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $55.1 million or 125%. The increase in customer acquisition costs was partially a result of management's decision to increase investment in display, search, and television marketing, as we continue to identify opportunities to drive new customer growth, as well as the customer acquisition costs we incurred following the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL.\nThe benefit for income taxes was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in tax expense was primarily due to the partial release of valuation allowance totaling $3.1 million as a result of the tax liability recorded for the Apostrophe acquisition, serving as a source of income for existing tax assets.\nRevenue", "item_7_text": "The following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the dollar and percentage change between the three periods (dollars in thousands):\nResults of Operations\n\nRevenue and Key Business Metrics\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021, 2020, and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2021 to 2020 and 2020 to 2019. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in, or incorporated by reference into, the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date hereof or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.\nWe generated $12.7 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.7 million, or 58%, as compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due to the addition of new retail partners in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased the overall volume of wholesale orders. We generated $8.0 million in Wholesale Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.8 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, we began selling to a large retailer, who continues to be a wholesale partner today.\n\nWe monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe the following metrics are useful in evaluating our business. The table below provides a breakdown of total revenue between Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, as well as key metrics that drive Online Revenue (i.e., Net Orders, AOV, and Subscriptions), and the dollar and percentage change between such periods (in thousands, except for AOV):\nOur ability to retain customers is a key factor in our ability to generate revenue. Most of our customers purchase products and services through subscription-based plans, where customers are billed and sent products and/or receive services on a recurring basis. The recurring nature of this revenue provides us with a certain amount of predictability for future revenue if past customer behavior stays consistent in the future. If customer behavior changes, and customer retention decreases in the future, then future revenue will be negatively impacted. The ability of our customers to continue to pay for our products and services will impact the future results of our operations.\nFrom inception through the Merger, we financed our operations primarily from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $71.8 million, which are invested in money market funds and government bonds, and investments in the amount of $175.5 million, which are invested in corporate, government, and asset-backed bonds.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nBusiness combinations\nTo fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include professional medical consultations, we maintain relationships with various Affiliated Medical Groups, which are professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and mental health providers; collectively referred to as Providers\u201d or individually, a Provider\u201d) to provide consultation services. We account for service revenue as a principal in the arrangement with our customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) we determine which Affiliated Medical Group and Provider provides the consultation to the customer; (ii) we are primarily responsible for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the services; (iii) we incur costs for consultation services even for visits that do not result in a prescription and the sale of products; and (iv) we, at our sole discretion, set all listed prices charged on our websites for products and services.\nCost of revenue\nWe estimate refunds using the expected value method based on historical refunds granted to customers. We update our estimate at the end of each reporting period and recognize the estimated amount as contra-revenue with a corresponding refund liability. Sales, value-added, and other taxes are excluded from the transaction price and, therefore, from revenue.\nSG&A expenses were $183.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $118.0 million or 180%. The largest single component of the increase in SG&A was an increase in stock-based compensation expense to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.9 million. Most of the increase in stock-based compensation was a result of expenses related to the earn-out consideration issued as part of the Merger, as well as the recognition of expense related to stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer and vesting of restricted stock units, both of which were contingent upon the achievement of a liquidity event that was satisfied upon the closing of the Merger. All of these resulted in either one-time expenses or cumulative catch-up expense as a result of the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we also incurred $5.2 million of bonus expense as a result of the previously disclosed one-time transaction bonuses related to the Merger.\nWe determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist, and we are closely monitoring its impact on all aspects of our business. We have a remote-first policy that permits most of our employees to work remotely should their particular positions allow, and we have taken measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing additional safety policies and procedures for employees working in our warehouse and Affiliated Pharmacies; suspending employee travel and in-person meetings prior to vaccination; and actively managing our fulfillment operations and inventory levels. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stockholders.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $18.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $5.8 million, non-cash losses for change in fair value of preferred stock warrants totaling $3.1 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $1.1 million, lease termination costs of $0.8 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.3 million. In addition, a cash inflow totaling $4.2 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.2 million, a decrease in inventory of $0.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.5 million, and an increase in other long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the improving leverage, after excluding certain non-cash expenses, from increased revenues, while reducing cost of revenue and marketing expenses.\nOnline Revenue\u201d represents the sales of products and services on our platform, net of refunds, credits, and chargebacks, and includes revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), primarily relating to deferred revenue and returns reserve. Online Revenue is generated by selling directly to consumers through our websites. Our Online Revenue consists of products and services purchased by customers directly through our online platform. The majority of our Online Revenue is subscription-based, where customers agree to be billed on a recurring basis to have products and services automatically delivered to them.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, AOV was $74, an increase of 19% compared to $62 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As described further below, AOV growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by higher price points from larger product bundles and multi-month Subscriptions (which allow customers to receive two to twelve months of product in one order). For the year ended December 31, 2020, AOV was $62, an increase of 88% compared to $33 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in AOV was driven by an increased uptake of higher AOV offerings by customers, targeted acquisition of higher AOV new customers from marketing, and a reduction in discounts offered to customers.\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly attributable to the products shipped and services rendered, including product costs, packaging materials, shipping costs, and labor costs directly related to revenue generating activities. Costs related to free products, where there is no expectation of future purchases from a customer, are considered to be SG&A (as defined below) and are excluded from cost of revenue.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The most significant component of our cash used during this period was a net loss of $72.1 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $8.0 million and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.3 million. This was partially offset by non-cash gains for change in fair value of Series C preferred stock warrants totaling $1.0 million and non-cash other income totaling $0.2 million. In addition, a cash outflow totaling $9.9 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.4 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.4 million, an increase in other long-term assets of $0.8 million, and an increase in inventory of $0.5 million. This outflow was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $0.2 million.\nWe expect to expand into new categories with our offerings. Category expansion allows us to increase the number of customers for whom we can provide products and services. It also allows us to offer access to treatment of additional conditions that may already affect our current customers. Expanding into new categories will require financial investments in additional headcount, marketing and customer acquisition expenses, additional operational capabilities, and may require the purchase of new inventory. If we are unable to generate sufficient demand in new categories, we may not recover the financial investments we make into new categories and revenue may not increase in the future.\nAdditionally, to fulfill our promise to customers for contracts that include sale of prescription products, we maintain relationships with certain affiliated and third-party pharmacies ( Partner Pharmacies\u201d or individually, a Partner Pharmacy\u201d) to fill prescriptions that are ordered by our customers for fulfillment through our websites. We account for prescription product revenue as a principal in the arrangement with our customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) we have sole discretion in determining which Partner Pharmacy fills a customer's prescription; (ii) Partner Pharmacies fill the prescription based on fulfillment instructions provided by us, including using our branded packaging for generic products; (iii) we are primarily responsible to the customer for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the order; (iv) we are responsible for refunds of the prescription medication after transfer of control to the customer; and (v) we, at our sole discretion, set all listed prices charged on our websites for products and services.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our treasury operations of investing in available-for-sale investments, as well as investment in acquisitions, website development, and internal-use software and purchase of property and equipment.\nNet Orders\u201d are defined as the number of online customer orders minus transactions related to refunds, credits, chargebacks, and other negative adjustments. Net Orders represent transactions made on our platform during a defined period of time and exclude revenue recognition adjustments recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP.\nAverage Order Value ( AOV\u201d) is defined as Online Revenue divided by Net Orders.\nWe believe the future of healthcare will be driven by consumer brands that empower people and give them full control over their healthcare. We have endeavored to build a healthcare model that squarely focuses on the needs of the healthcare consumer. To further our mission, we offer a range of health and wellness products and services available for purchase directly by customers on our websites and mobile application, and through wholesale partners.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor online sales, payment for prescription medication and non-prescription products is typically collected from the customer a few days in advance of product shipment. Contract liabilities are recorded when payments have been received from the customer for undelivered products or services and are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are later satisfied. Contract liabilities consisting of balances related to customer prepayments are recognized as current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets since the associated revenue will be primarily recognized within the following month. For wholesale arrangements, payments are collected in accordance with contract terms.\nCost of revenue was $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $28.1 million, or 71%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 94%, increased shipping costs of 54%, and increased costs associated with medical consultation services of 43%. The product, packaging, and shipping costs increases were due to overall increased business activity, growth of Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. Costs associated with medical consultation services are a product of the number of consultations and the cost per consultation. While the number of consultations increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, we reduced the cost per consultation during that year by implementing more efficient payment programs, resulting in a decrease in medical consultation services costs in relation to overall revenue growth.\nOur largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities includes costs of revenue, marketing expenses and personnel-related expenditures to support the growth of our business.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWhen we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders, we evaluate whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company's stockholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price is based on the prices at which we separately sell the products and services, as well as market and cost-plus estimates.\nGross profit was $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $95.0 million or 87%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from higher growth in revenue as compared to growth in variable costs, such as shipping costs and those associated with medical consultation services, partially offset by the impact of the operations of Apostrophe and HHL.\nOther income (expense)\nMarketing expenses were $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.2 million or 7%. Customer acquisition costs decreased to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $7.6 million or 15%. Management decided to reduce customer acquisition costs in 2020 in order to focus on acquiring higher AOV customers for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other marketing expenses, such as salaries and wages, and related benefits due to an increase in marketing-related headcount.\nmobile phone technology, including our recently launched mobile application. We expect to make significant investments in marketing to acquire new customers and we intend to continue to invest in our fulfillment and operating capabilities, including our own affiliated pharmacies and warehousing facilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in web and mobile technology to improve the customer experience on our platform. In the short term, we expect these investments to increase our operating expenses; however, in the long term, we anticipate that these investments will positively impact our results of operations. If we are unsuccessful at improving our offerings or are unable to generate additional demand for our offerings, we may not recover the financial investments we make into the business and revenue may not increase in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any borrowing arrangements and there are no outstanding borrowings. All past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution have been paid in full. Refer to Note 13 - Borrowing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of past borrowing arrangements.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flow data (in thousands):\nCost of revenue was $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.4 million, or 4%. This increase was primarily due to increased product and packaging costs of approximately 27%, which were offset by decreased costs associated with medical consultation services of 18% and decreased shipping costs of 5%. The number of consultations and the cost per consultation both declined for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther income (expense), net, was $4.2 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $7.1 million. The change was driven primarily by a gain from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3.8 million compared to a loss from the change in fair value of liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.1 million.\nIn addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nRevenue\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $47.7 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $51.9 million. Proceeds from exercise of warrants and stock options provided cash inflow totaling $0.7 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by Merger transaction costs of $3.4 million and term loan repayments of $1.5 million.\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less our total cost of revenue, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the prices we charge for our products and services, the costs we incur from our vendors for certain components of our cost of revenues, the mix of the various products and services we sell in a period, the mix of Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue in a period, and our ability to sell our inventory. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period depending on these and other factors.\nWe generated $259.2 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $118.4 million, or 84%, as compared to $140.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by growth in Subscriptions, AOV, Net Orders, and the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL, which contributed $12.1 million of incremental revenue from the dates of their respective acquisitions. We generated $140.7 million in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $58.4 million, or 71%, compared to $82.3 million for year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in Online Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by growth in Subscriptions and AOV. Although Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, this was more than offset by an increase in AOV, resulting in an overall increase in Online Revenue.\nOther income (expense), net, was $2.8 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.4 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $5.3 million. The change was driven primarily by a 2020 increase in the fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability as compared to a 2019 decrease in the fair value of this liability.\nWe have historically incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses at least for the next 12 months due to the investments that we intend to make in our business. We believe our existing cash resources and funds raised from the closing of the Merger are sufficient to support planned operations for the next 12 months. As a result, management believes that our current financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe largest component of our marketing expenses consists of our discretionary customer acquisition costs. Customer acquisition costs are the advertising and media costs associated with our efforts to acquire new customers, promote our brands, and build awareness for our products and services. Customer acquisition costs include advertising in digital media, social media, television, radio, out-of-home media, and various other media outlets. Marketing expenses also include overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel; agency, contractor, and consulting expenses; content production, software, and other marketing operating costs. Marketing is an important driver of growth and we intend to continue to make significant investments in customer acquisition and our marketing organization. As a result, we\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $156.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $104.8 million, as well as acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $46.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $4.2 million including investment in our mobile technology, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $0.8 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The most significant component of our cash used was a net loss of $107.7 million. This included non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation of $67.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million, net amortization on securities of $2.2 million, non-cash operating lease cost of $1.5 million, and non-cash acquisition-related costs of $1.2 million. Non-cash expense was partially offset by non-cash income of $3.8 million related to the change in fair value of liabilities and benefit for deferred taxes of $3.4 million. In addition, a net cash inflow totaling $3.5 million was attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $10.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $3.2 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.4 million. This inflow was partially offset by an increase in inventory of $9.6 million and a change in operating lease liabilities of $1.5 million since adoption of the new lease standard. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in cash used in operating activities reflects investment in business growth, including investment in direct marketing, personnel-related expenditures, and supply chain management.\nWholesale Revenue\u201d represents non-prescription product sales to retailers through wholesale purchasing agreements. We sell only non-prescription products to wholesale partners. In addition to being revenue generative and profitable, wholesale partnerships have the added benefit of generating brand awareness with new customers in physical environments.\nSome of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the U.S. GAAP items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not a substitute for, other financial performance measures, including our net loss and other U.S. GAAP results.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe expect to continue to focus on long-term growth through investments in product offerings and customer experience. We are working to enhance our offerings and expand the breadth of products and services offered on our websites. This includes near term investments in the ability to accept insurance on our platform for certain products or services and further development of\nCash Flows\nKey Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nCost of revenue and gross profit\n(*)Not meaningful\nOverview\nThe following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):\nSubscriptions\u201d are defined as the number of customer agreements where the customer has agreed to be automatically billed on a recurring basis at a defined cadence. The billing cadence is typically defined as a number of months (for example, billed every month or every three months). Subscriptions are excluded from our reporting when payment has not occurred at the contracted billing cadence. Subscription billing is preferred by many of our customers because most of the products and services we make available treat chronic conditions and these product and service offerings are most effective when taken consistently and continuously. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and services and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products and services.\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products and services through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, we offer a range of health and wellness products through wholesale partners.\nSG&A expenses were $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.7 million or 17%. The increase in SG&A was driven by an increase in salaries and wages, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation expense to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, in 2020, consulting expenses related to professional services increased to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the Merger. In July 2020, we ceased use of our headquarters office facility and other offices, recording a lease termination fee of $1.4 million. In January 2020, we also entered into a new operating lease arrangement for a warehouse space in New Albany, Ohio, which contributed to an increase in rent expense of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nHims & Hers, formerly known as Oaktree Acquisition Corp. ( OAC\u201d), is a direct-to-customer telehealth company incorporated in Delaware. Our mission is to make healthcare accessible, affordable, and convenient for everyone. Our proprietary websites, telehealth platform, electronic medical records system, and pharmacy integration combine to provide customers with a seamless, easy-to-use, digital-first experience. We are leading the transformation in healthcare by becoming the digital front door for healthcare consumers.\nGross profit was $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $64.8 million or 145%. Correspondingly, gross margin was 74% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of a proportionately lower increase in cost of revenue than the increase in revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented:\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $39.3 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $37.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $1.5 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $0.3 million.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions, and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, we may engage a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations.\nNew customer acquisition\nU.S. GAAP requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if an entity is the primary beneficiary. Under the variable interest model, the primary beneficiary is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the variable interest entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.\n\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nOur ability to attract new customers is a key factor for our future growth. To date, we have successfully acquired new customers through marketing and the development of our brands and, recently, through acquisitions. As a result, revenue has increased each year since our launch. If we are unable to acquire enough new customers in the future, revenue might decline. New customer acquisition could be negatively impacted if our marketing efforts are less effective in the future. Increases in advertising rates could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers. Consumer tastes, preferences, and sentiment for our brands may also change and result in decreased demand for our products and services. Changes in law or regulatory enforcement could also negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers.\nExpansion into new categories\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n______________\nOther income (expense)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as net loss before depreciation and amortization, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of liabilities, one-time Merger bonuses and warrant expense, and acquisition-related costs, which include professional services and consideration paid for employee equity with vesting requirements incurred directly as a result of acquisitions.\nIndebtedness\nCash flows from operating activities\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n ______________\n\n(*)Not meaningful\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the number of orders we receive, the size of our customer base, the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales, marketing and development activities, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We completed two acquisitions in 2021, and expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed. In order to support the growth of our business, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or seek capital through new equity or debt financings, which sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nMarketing expenses\nOur consolidated revenue primarily comprises online sales of health and wellness products through our websites, including prescription and non-prescription products. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Additionally, revenue is generated through wholesale arrangements.\nWe continuously test and optimize the online experience and offerings to improve the customer experience, maximize sales, and improve gross margin. In our subscription arrangements, customers select a cadence at which they wish to receive product shipments. In addition to a monthly cadence, we offer customers the ability to select from a range of shipment cadences, from every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed upon each shipment. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions at any time. In addition, our customers can purchase product bundles or defined product kits, either consisting of non-prescription over-the-counter products or non-prescription products together with prescription medications, for a single all-inclusive price. Such offerings and their uptake by customers have contributed to the expansion of AOV over time. Additionally, the uptake of these offerings have resulted in higher gross profits and gross margins. For example, for multi-month subscriptions, we may incur shipping and fulfillment expenses two or four times per year (for six-month and three-month subscription cadences, respectively) versus twelve times per year for monthly subscriptions. The customer uptake of multi-month subscriptions results in lower recurring costs and higher gross margins as compared to monthly subscriptions.\nCurrently, we conduct business through one operating segment. Substantially all our long-lived assets are maintained in, and our losses are attributable to, the United States of America. Foreign operations are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. The variable interest entities are: (i) professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed healthcare providers that engage licensed clinical professionals to provide consultation services (i.e., the Affiliated Medical Groups); and (ii) XeCare and Apostrophe Pharmacy, each of which is a licensed mail order pharmacy providing prescription fulfillment services solely to our customers (i.e., the Affiliated Pharmacies). We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups and the Affiliated Pharmacies for accounting purposes because we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect these entities' economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the entities' losses. Under the variable interest entity model, we present the results of operations and the financial position of the entities as part of our consolidated financial statements as if the consolidated group were a single economic entity.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are the policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is attributed to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) include the salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation for personnel for our executive, engineering, finance, supply chain management, and other administrative functions. SG&A also includes general operating expenses for professional services, third-party software and hosting, facilities, warehousing and fulfillment, customer service, payment processing, depreciation and amortization, and acquisition-related expenses. We expect SG&A to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase headcount with the growth of our business. We also expect SG&A to increase in the near term as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; and an increase in legal, audit, insurance, investor relations, professional services, and other administrative expenses. In addition, SG&A increases when we incur acquisition costs related to purchasing businesses. However, we anticipate SG&A to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the timing and amount of these expenses.\nOur financial condition and results of operations to date have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken by the federal, state, or local authorities (including vaccine mandates) and businesses affected, supply chain impacts, and the resulting economic impact may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial positions as well as our customers, suppliers, and partners. Widespread supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic have impacted businesses across multiple industries, including those in which we operate. If we experience delays or other challenges in obtaining supplies necessary for the production, fulfillment, or distribution of the products or services we offer, it could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our obligations to customers and maintain our operations in a cost-efficient manner and have a material adverse effect on our business. We will continue to monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its related resurgences and variants, and adjust our strategy accordingly.\nRevenue was $271.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $123.1 million, or 83%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. Revenue was $148.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $66.2 million, or 80%, primarily attributable to an increase in Online Revenue. For detailed discussion of these increases, refer to -Revenue and Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nGross profit and gross margin\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.3 million, which was primarily due to the sale of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, net of cash paid for issuance costs, of $102.6 million, and term loan borrowings of $2.1 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by term loan repayments of $9.1 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million.\nRetention of customers\nSubscriptions grew 95% to approximately 609,000 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 312,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2020. Subscriptions grew 64% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately 190,000 subscriptions as of December 31, 2019. Growth in Subscriptions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was driven by increased customer conversion rates from improved onsite and customer onboarding experiences, increased customer engagement with our marketing campaigns, increased retention rates of existing subscribers (also referred to as members\u201d), and in 2021, increased marketing expenses and the addition of Subscriptions from the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. As a result of growth in Subscriptions, we generated approximately 3.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 54% as compared to approximately 2.3 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 9% as compared to approximately 2.5 million Net Orders for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due, in part, to the implementation of a strategy beginning in the third quarter of 2019 to acquire higher value and higher AOV customers and to enhance the customer experience with new offerings and subscription options. As we implemented this strategy, we reduced marketing expenses, and as a result, Net Orders declined in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nComparisons for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nWe account for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control of a product has been transferred to the customer, in cost of revenue.\nexpect our marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future, although our marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period due to the timing and discretionary nature of these expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nInvestments in growth\nFor information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation include two performance obligations: access to (i) products and (ii) consultation services. Our contracts for prescription refills and contracts that do not contain prescription products have a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product to the customer and, in contracts that contain services, by the provision of consultation services to the customer. We satisfy our performance obligation for products at a point in time, which is upon delivery of the products to a third-party carrier. We satisfy our performance obligation for services over the period of the consultation service, which is typically a few days. The customer obtains control of the products and services upon our completion of our performance obligations.\nWe perform ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with the Affiliated Medical Groups and Affiliated Pharmacies would cause our consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the variable interest entities with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP.\nOur contractual obligations and commitments include earn-out payables and earn-out liabilities related to acquisitions, operating leases, and non-cancelable purchase obligations primarily related to cloud-based software contracts used in operations. Total contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 were $53.6 million, of which $46.2 million was payable within 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily attributable to state taxes.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nOther income (expense) primarily consists of the change in fair value of warrant and earn-out liabilities, as well as interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and investment accounts. Additionally, other income (expense) includes non-operating and one-time charges classified outside of operating expenses, and interest expense related to our past borrowing arrangements with a leading financial institution, which have been paid in full.\nRevenue recognition\nMarketing expenses\nBasis of Presentation\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $235.0 million, which was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock as a result of the Merger of $197.7 million, proceeds from the PIPE Investment (as defined in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) of $75.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options of $2.0 million, and proceeds received from employee repayment of promissory notes of $1.2 million. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments related to pre-closing stock repurchase of $22.0 million, Merger transaction costs of $12.9 million, and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $6.0 million.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $39.7 million, which was due to net investment cash outflows of $35.5 million, investment in website development and internal-use software of $2.5 million, and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets of $1.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nHowever, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review net loss and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe income tax benefit (provision) primarily consists of a partial release in valuation allowance in 2021, as well as state taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. Management makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates.\nFor Online Revenue, we define our customer as an individual who purchases products or services through websites. For Wholesale Revenue, we define our customer as a wholesale partner. The transaction price in our contracts with customers is the total amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider forming a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur management monitors two financial results, Online Revenue and Wholesale Revenue (both defined below), to track our total revenue generation.\nExcluding stock-based compensation and Merger bonuses, employee compensation expense was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $22.1 million or 115%. Furthermore, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in SG&A was due to an $8.5 million increase in professional services as a result of overall increased business activity and compliance requirements associated with being a public company, a $7.5 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and technology costs, a $7.1 million increase in insurance premiums as a result of becoming a public entity, $6.9 million of fees incurred for acquisitions, a $6.0 million increase in order fulfillment, warehouse, selling, and processing costs, and $1.6 million of product development costs.\nMarketing expenses were $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $76.9 million or 130%. The most significant component of marketing expenses is customer acquisition costs, which increased to $99.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $55.1 million or 125%. The increase in customer acquisition costs was partially a result of management's decision to increase investment in display, search, and television marketing, as we continue to identify opportunities to drive new customer growth, as well as the customer acquisition costs we incurred following the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL.\nThe benefit for income taxes was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the provision for income taxes was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in tax expense was primarily due to the partial release of valuation allowance totaling $3.1 million as a result of the tax liability recorded for the Apostrophe acquisition, serving as a source of income for existing tax assets.\nRevenue", "item_7_tables": "Table 6: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
