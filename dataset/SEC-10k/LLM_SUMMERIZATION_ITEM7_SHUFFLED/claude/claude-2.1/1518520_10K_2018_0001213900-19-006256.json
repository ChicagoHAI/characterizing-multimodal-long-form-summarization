Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein. In addition to historical information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those expressed, implied or anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report and other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect,\u201d outlook,\u201d forecast,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d continue,\u201d sustain\u201d, on track\u201d, believe,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d may,\u201d assume,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions are often used to identify such forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward- looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in our reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.\nOverview and Financial Condition\nIcagen is a drug discovery company with a focus in Neuroscience and Rare Disease. The Icagen platform is unique as it integrates our current state of the art drug discovery engine along with an artificial intelligence (AI) computational platform that enables an accelerated path to drug discovery.\nOur business model is focused on research collaborations and partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and foundations who we partner with to support the discovery and development of innovative pharmaceuticals. These revenue-generating partnerships provide current funding while our co-owned pipeline of drug candidates provides the potential of additional significant long-term upside through milestone and royalty payments in new partnerships. The development and commercialization expense of these assets is being partially funded by our partners.\nFor the past three years, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization providing integrated drug discovery services with unique expertise in the field of ion channel, transporter, neuroscience and rare disease targets while also covering many other classes of drug discovery targets and therapeutic areas. Our customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to whom we offer our industry-leading scientific expertise and technologies to aid in their determination of which molecules to advance into late stage preclinical studies and ultimately clinical trials. The core of our offering is the discovery of pre-clinical drug candidates (PDC's), which are lead molecules (Leads) that are selected to enter into in-vivo studies during the pre-clinical phase of drug discovery. We offer a full complement of pre-clinical drug discovery services which include; assay development technologies (including high throughput fluorescence, manual and automated electrophysiology and radiotracer flux assays), cell line generation, high-throughput and ultra-high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and custom assay services to our customers. Our capabilities also include molecular biology and the use of complex functional assays, electrophysiology, bioanalytics and pharmacology. We believe that this integrated set of capabilities enhances our ability to help our customers identify drug candidates.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMore recently, we have begun to focus on partnership and collaboration opportunities with third parties, and we have entered into two such collaborations that provide us with an opportunity to derive revenue not only from our standard fees for integrated early discovery services but also from future milestone and royalty revenue from product candidates that may be developed and commercialized with our aid. We have developed in house a portfolio of assets targeting different indications that we believe would be ideal candidates for partnership opportunities.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our securities, settlement of legal matters and revenue we generate from the services we provide and upfront payments received from collaborations. We expect to continue to seek to obtain our required capital through the private sale of securities and revenue derived from the services we provide.\nSubsequent to our acquisition of certain assets from Pfizer and Sanofi, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization from two commercial customers. We have also entered into Master Services Agreements ( MSA\u201d) with other various pharmaceutical companies where we have agreed to perform certain services for them.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, 100% of our revenue was derived from commercial revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 56.2% of our revenue was derived from commercial revenues, 42.4% was derived from deferred subsidy revenue and 1.4% was generated from Government revenue. Despite generating funds from commercial customers and collaborations/partnerships, we continue to experience losses and during 2018 raised money from the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Term Loans and our Subordinated Notes in order to fund our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the $5,000,000 up front fee that we received from Roche and the $2,800,000 that we raised from our recent sale of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the $500,000 that we raised from the sale of our Subordinated Notes and the $15,250,000 that we raised from the sale of the Term Loans, of which $10,200,000 was used to repay our convertible debt, will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next four months. We will need to generate additional revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nPrior to our acquisition of the Icagen assets, substantially all of our revenue was derived from government grants related to the use of our XRpro technology. To date, we had been granted twenty-one grants and contracts from United States governmental agencies; of which nine were granted from the Department of Defense and twelve were granted from the National Institutes of Health. All grants and contracts have been completed and paid for in full.\nAs a result of the agreements that we entered into with Pfizer Research we have incurred significant obligations including the obligation: (i) make additional payments in terms of the Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with Pfizer including beginning in 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the Earn Out Payment\u201d) of 10% of revenue earned during the quarter, with a minimum payment of $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, such minimum being reduced to $50,000 for the quarters ending March 2017 to December 2018 and the difference between $250,000 or the quarterly amount paid and the actual calculation of deferred purchase consideration at 10% of gross revenue per quarter is being deferred and paid as one lump sum with the payment being made for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, bearing interest at 12.5% per annum, which interest is payable quarterly; (iii) make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period July l, 2015 to April 30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $66,950.\nDiscussions with respect to our operations included herein include the operations of our operating subsidiaries, Icagen Corp and Icagen-T, Inc. We have another two subsidiary companies, Caldera Discovery Inc. and XRpro Sciences Inc., which have always been dormant.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had revenues totaling $13,583,218, all of which was from commercial revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenues totaling $22,656,610 ($12,735,867 of which was from commercial revenue, $9,600,000 was from subsidy revenue and $320,743 was from government grants), a decrease of $9,073,392 or 40.0%. The decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in deferred subsidy of $9,600,000, there was no deferred subsidy revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in government grants of $320,743, there was no government grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by an increase in commercial revenues of $847,351 or 6.7%. The decrease in revenue over the prior year is primarily attributable to the following; i) cessation of the subsidy revenue received from Sanofi initially to support the Tucson Facility, in the prior year; ii) the completion of the remaining National Institutes of Health government grant work during 2017; offset by iii) an increase in revenue at both our Tucson and North Carolina sites, including revenues received from our CFF collaboration agreement which offset the declining revenues from Sanofi. The upfront payment received from Roche will be recognized as revenue over a period of time commencing in January 2019.\nWe continue to market our services to several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We believe that we now have a comprehensive product offering and substantial credibility to offer a full range of products including the advantages and value propositions of the XRpro\u00ae technology. While we are optimistic about our prospects, there can be no assurance about whether or when our products will generate sufficient revenues with adequate margins in order for us to be profitable.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold totaled $9,910,569 and $11,175,692 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1,265,123 or 11.3%. Cost of goods sold is primarily comprised of direct expenses related to providing our services to our customers. These direct expenses include salary expenses directly related to our statements of work and research contracts including those of our scientific personnel expenses, recoverable expenses incurred on contracts, the cost of outside consultants, and direct materials used on our contracts.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The salary expense included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively was $5,791,963 and $6,880,513, a decrease of $1,088,550 or 15.8%. This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel at our Tucson facility, a reduction in bonus accruals and the number of personnel working on Sanofi projects, partially offset by new business, including the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement. For additional information regarding salary expense reference is made to the discussion of total salary expense in selling, general and administrative expenses below. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The laboratory supplies and direct materials included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively was $3,334,984 and $3,303,311, an increase of $31,673 or 1.0%, the slight increase is due to the nature of the work performed requiring more expensive seal chips partially offset by more effective cost control over general consumables. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Outside contractors' cost included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, amounted to $783,622 and $991,868, a decrease of $208,246 or 21.0% is due to the reduction in the cost of outside laboratory maintenance contracts, primarily at our Tucson Facility. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nGross profit was $3,672,649 and $11,480,918 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $7,808,269, or 68.0%. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the cessation of the Sanofi subsidy which amounted to $9,600,000 in the prior year, after factoring in the reduction of the subsidy revenue, the gross profit increased by $1,791,731, primarily due to reduced labor costs and a reduction in outside contractors costs, as discussed above and slightly more profitable business conducted during the current year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $10,309,471 and $13,936,542 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $3,627,071 or 26.0%.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe major expenses making up selling, general and administrative expenses included the

marketing expenditure over the prior period is primarily due a change in strategy with less reliance placed on developing a comprehensive Contract Research Organization ( CRO\u201d) business model, therefore less marketing effort was required during the current year.

We also reduced our bonus accrual related to the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years to reflect the actual bonus liability.\nThe payroll expense charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $2,322,245. This decrease is primarily due to the termination of the business development team in the prior year and the restructure of our management team at our Tucson site, together with a reduction in the overall bonus accrual for management.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe research and development salaries decreased by $1,141,653 primarily due to the streamlining of operations at our Tucson facility by the reduction in staff numbers and the level of scientific activity at both our Tucson Facility and our Icagen NC sites with new customers and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\nDirectors' cash fees remained the same as the prior year, with no increase in directors' headcount and with approved fees retained at prior year levels.\nThe stock option compensation charge increased by $870,068. The charge for each period is dependent upon the number of options granted, any new options issued, the value of the options and the vesting schedule of these options. During the current year, 1,005,000 options to purchase shares of common stock were issued to our directors, executive officers and consultants. These options resulted in an increased expense in the current year as approximately 287,500 of these options vested immediately with the balance vesting over a period of twelve to thirty six months.\nLegal fees decreased by $438,313 over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to legal expenditure incurred on the 2017 GPB convertible debt funding due to the complexity of the legal documentation and a current year reversal of legal fees recorded as due to Dentons on the settlement of all liabilities owing to them.\nThe decrease in consulting fees of $36,692 is primarily due to the reduction in technical consulting expenses incurred at our Tucson Facility where an outside consultant assisted us with the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement, offset by an increase in administrative consulting expenses at corporate financial controller level.\nProfessional fees increased by $12,301, primarily due to an increase in payroll related fees based on the outsourcing of several payroll functions in order to improve the quality of service delivered to our employees.\nFacilities expense decreased by $252,332 over the prior year, primarily due to the following movements; (i) a decrease in cleaning and janitorial expenses of $131,664 due to a restructure in our agreement with our building maintenance contractor at the Tucson Facility; (ii) a decrease in utility expense by $54,944, primarily due to reductions at our Tucson Facility due to better negotiated tariffs ; (iii) a decrease in Security services expenditure of $46,594 due to a restructure of our security costs at our Tucson Facility and; (iv) a reduction in site repairs and maintenance expenditure at our Tucson Facility of $19,130 due to the cancellation and streamlining of certain maintenance contacts.\nTravel expenditure decreased by $138,234 due to the termination of our business development team during the prior year.\nCapital raising fees of $76,000 related to the GBP debt were expensed in the prior year.\nOther expenses represent various insignificant individually insignificant expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe recognized depreciation expenses of $1,486,919 and $1,736,628 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $249,709 or 14.4%, which is primarily due to a reduction in the amount of laboratory software licensed during the current year. Software licenses are generally for a one year period and are amortized over the term of the license agreement. The balance of the depreciation expense is primarily made up of depreciation of our laboratory equipment and software licensing, which makes up the majority of our capital assets.\nAmortization expense was $378,148 and $224,984 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, an increase of $153,164 or 68.1%. The increase is due to the amortization of cell lines purchased at our Tucson Facility in the prior year. The remaining amortization charge relates primarily to the intangibles acquired at our Icagen NC site.\nOther income\nOther income was $15,779 and $502,494 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $486,715 or 96.9%, primarily made up of the prior year reversal of deferred purchase consideration initially due on the acquisition of Icagen NC, due to our customer not meeting certain revenue milestones.\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nGain on debt extinguishment was $495,783 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain arose on the extinguishment of the GPB convertible debt on August 31, 2018 and represents the unamortized debt discount, the derivative liability related to the convertible debt conversion feature and expenses directly related to the debt extinguishment.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was $562,524 and $262,966 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $299,558 or 113.9%. Other expense in the current period represents severance costs of $572,524 incurred in the restructure of our management and the streamlining of operations at our Tucson Facility and the release of a $10,000 legal settlement accrual no longer required. In the prior year, other expense represented severance costs on the reduction of our business development team by four heads.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nInterest expense totaled $3,190,730 and $2,282,046 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The interest expense is primarily made up of the following; (i) Imputed interest cost of $299,075 and $308,252 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9,177 or 3.0%, the imputed interest was adjusted in the prior year due to the reassessment of the length of time to repay the Pfizer deferred purchase consideration based on our future revenue projections and minimum payments we are required to make; (ii) amortization of debt discount of $1,229,994 and $1,110,424 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $119,570 or 10.8%, The debt discount represents the amortization of the valuation of the current year warrants issued in connection with our term loans, the debt issue costs associated with the current year term loans, the valuation of the conversion feature of the prior year Convertible Notes and the prior year warrants issued in connection with the Convertible Notes which is amortized over the term of the term loan and Convertible Notes. The valuation of the discount on the term loan amounted to $2,753,009 on a principal balance of $15,250,000 and the discount on the convertible note in the prior year amounted to $4,918,277 on a principal balance of $10,000,000; (iii) interest expense of $1,660,722 and $859,760 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $800,962, this increase is primarily due to us borrowing $10,000,000 in May 2017 and replacing that borrowing with a $15,250,000 facility on August 31, 2018, the interest expense was incurred for four and a half months longer in the current year and the quantum of the borrowing increased by $5,250,000. The coupon of the borrowing decreased slightly from 13% per annum to 9.75% plus one month Libor, which average is approximately 0.8% lower than the 13% on the convertible debt; and (iv) other of $939 and $3,610 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, this consists primarily on foreign exchange movements on purchases and sales to foreign suppliers and customers.\nDerivative liability movement\nDerivative liability movement was $(1,295,732) and $349,313 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1,645,045. The debit during the current year represents the mark to market of the derivative liability raised on the warrants issued to the term loan holders, the GBP warrants and the Series C Preferred stock warrants, all with variable pricing options and the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt whilst it was still outstanding.\nNet loss\nNet loss was $13,039,313 and $6,110,434 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the net loss is primarily due to the reduction in subsidy revenue and government contract revenue, an increase in interest expense and derivative liability movements, offset by a reduction in overall selling, general and administrative expenses, all discussed in detail above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a history of operating losses and net losses since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities and cash flows generated from government contracts and grants, settlement of lawsuits and more recently from debt funding, commercial customers and subsidy income. Although, we are generating revenue from commercial customers, we continue to experience losses and may need to raise additional funds in the future to meet our working capital requirements. To date, we have never generated sufficient cash from operations to pay our operating expenses. We have received $27,500,000 from Sanofi and despite the $4,500,000 we expect to derive from Icagen-T for services provided to Sanofi over the next eighteen months, we expect our expenses to increase as our operations expand and our expenses may continue to exceed such revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised an additional $2,800,000 through the issuance of shares of our Series C Preferred stock, an additional $500,000 through the issuance of Bridge Notes and a further $15,250,000 in Term Loans of which $10,200,000 was utilized to settle convertible debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, despite out fund raising efforts mentioned in the preceding sentence, we had not generated sufficient additional revenue from operations to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, including cash derived from the Series C Preferred Stock issued, the term loans and the bridge notes will not be sufficient to meet our operating needs for at least the next four months without additional revenue derived from operations or collaborations. If we should require additional capital, we may consider multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $4,119,058, other current assets totaling $2,224,774 and total assets of $15,615,587. We had total current liabilities of $10,938,402 and a net working capital deficit of $4,594,570. Total liabilities were $34,973,296 including net deferred purchase consideration of $8,581,739. The deferred purchase consideration includes a net present value discount of $1,118,261 (made up of a gross present value discount of $2,468,700 less imputed interest movements of $1,350,439), the gross amount still due in terms of the acquisition agreement with Pfizer, Inc., is $9,700,000 after the payment of $300,000 to date, based on a potential earn out charge of the greater of (i) 10% of gross revenues commencing in January 2017 per quarter and (ii) $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum of $10,000,000 of which amounts in excess of $50,000 can be deferred and $200,000 was deferred for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 through to, December 31, 2018. The deferred amount bears interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum. Our stockholders' deficit amounted to $19,357,709.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShould we not achieve our forecasted operating results, or should strategic opportunities present themselves such that additional financial resources would present attractive investing opportunities for us, we may decide in the future to issue debt or sell our equity securities in order to raise additional cash. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure any additional financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur.\nand 2017 Financings\nSeries C Preferred Stock Financings\nFrom April 4, 2018 through August 27, 2018, we closed four tranches of our best efforts offering of preferred stock and warrants pursuant to which we issued to investors an aggregate of 28 units (the Series C Units\u201d), at a purchase price of $100,000 per unit, each unit consisting of approximately 28,571 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, and a seven year warrant (the Series C Warrant\u201d) to acquire approximately 28,571 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. An aggregate of 799,989 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 799,989 shares of common stock were sold at the four closings. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the Series C Units was approximately $2,800,000.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of our common stock and any other class or series of stock issued by us with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 12.0% per annum, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Powers, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock classifying the Series C Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation\u201d). The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into such number of shares of common stock as shall be equal to $3.50 plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series C Preferred Stock (the Accreted Value\u201d) divided by the conversion price, which initially shall be $3.50 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock based upon the then effective conversion price upon the (i) closing of a sale of shares of common stock to the public in a Qualifying Public Offering (as defined below) or a reverse merger into a publicly reporting company that has its common stock listed or quoted and traded on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation) or (ii) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Requisite Holders\u201d). A Qualifying Public Offering\u201d is defined as the first firm commitment underwritten public offering by us on or following the initial issuance date of the Series C Preferred Stock in which shares of common stock are sold for our account solely for cash to the public resulting in proceeds to it and/or our subsidiary, Icagen-T, Inc. of no less than $8,000,000 (after deduction only of underwriter discounts and commissions) and where the shares of common stock registered under the Securities Act, and sold in such public offering are simultaneously listed and commence trading on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation).\nEach holder of Series C Preferred Stock has the right to cast the number of votes equal to three times the number of shares into which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a group, have the right to elect one director on our Board of Directors. We cannot take the following actions without the approval of the Requisite Holders and the consent of our Board of Directors, including the Series C Preferred Stock director: (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business, (ii) amend our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (iii) create any new class of stock unless it ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and liquidation, (iv) amend or alter any class of stock pari passu with the Series C Preferred Stock to make it senior with respect to dividends and liquidation, (v) purchase or redeem any other shares of our stock, or (vi) increase the size of our Board of Directors.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a preference on liquidation equal to $5.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Liquidity Event (as defined below), the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock can require us to redeem their shares of Series C Preferred Stock for a price per share equal to $5.25, subject to adjustments. In addition, we have the right to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred at any time for a price per share equal to $5.25 subject to adjustments. A Cash Liquidity Event\u201d is defined as the closing of any sale, lease or licensing transaction relating to a single asset or multiple assets other than in our ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to a sale of a building, sale of biological assets or other upfront payments, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds received by us at closing or closings in a transaction or transactions during any twelve (12) month period in excess of $40,000,000.\nThe Series C Warrants have an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments). The Series C Warrants expire seven (7) years after the issuance date.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, subject to limited exceptions, a holder of the Series C Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Series C Warrant if such holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined in the Series C Warrant). A holder of the Series C Warrant may adjust the Beneficial Ownership Limitation upon not less than sixty one (61) days' prior notice to us, provided that such Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event shall exceed 9.99%.\nThe Series C Warrants also contain certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions.\nIf, at the time a holder exercises its Series C Warrant, there is no effective registration statement registering for an issuance of the shares underlying the Series C Warrant to the holder, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Series C Warrant. If we fail to timely deliver the shares underlying the Series C Warrant, it will be subject to certain buy-in provisions.\nThe Series C Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity (as defined in the Series C Warrant) assumes in writing all of our obligations under the Series C Warrant and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the holders, including agreements to deliver to the in exchange for the Series C Warrants a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Series C Warrant; (ii) we or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) agrees at our election or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holders by paying to the holders cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series C Warrant); or (iii) a holder, at its election, requires us or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holder by paying to the holder cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value.\nPursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold, we granted to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock certain demand registration and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain rights of our lender.\nSubordinated Note Financings\nIn addition, on August 13, 2018, we issued our 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 due on the earlier of: (x) the date that is twelve (12) months after its issue date or (y) our receipt of the proceeds of funding from our next collaboration/partnership. We also issued to the holders of the 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes five year warrants to purchase 1,500 shares of our common stock for each $10,000 principal amount invested at an exercise price of $3.50 per share (the Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The 10% Subordinated Note Warrants also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transaction. An aggregate of $500,000 in principal amount of 10% Subordinate Promissory Notes and Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 75,000 shares of common stock were sold at the closing. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the fifty (50) units was $500,000. 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $200,000 were repaid when we received the upfront payment from the Roche collaboration and 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $300,000 currently remain outstanding and are subordinated in certain respects to the Term Loans\nTerm Loans\nIn our August 2018 debt financing with Perceptive, we received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $7,250,000 from the Icagen Term Loan and issued a warrant to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock (the Purchaser Warrants\u201d), and Icagen-T received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000 from the Icagen-T Term Loan. The Term Loans are secured by a security interest in all of our existing and future assets, subject to existing security interests and exceptions. The Term Loans require us and Icagen-T, respectively, among other things, to maintain the security interest, make monthly interest payments of approximately $160,000, make monthly installment payments of $152,500 after August 31, 2020 and meet various negative and affirmative covenants. If we or Icagen-T fails to comply with the terms of the Term Loans and/or the related agreements, the senior note holder could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, the secured creditor would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their Term Loans, subject to the first priority of our secured creditors. Any action by our secured or unsecured creditors to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations.\nThe Term Loans contain, and our future indebtedness agreements may contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Term Loans restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>incur, assume or guarantee additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Term Loans); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>repurchase capital stock; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>make other restricted payments including, without limitation, paying dividends and making investments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>create liens; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>enter into mergers or consolidations; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>enter into transactions with affiliates </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the Credit Agreements also contain covenants requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain cash and cash equivalents held in one or more accounts subject to the first priority perfected security interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreements of not less than (a) $1,000,000 following the closing date until March 31, 2019, and (b) $1,500,000 at all times thereafter. The Credit Agreements also provide for specified quarterly minimum consolidated net revenue covenants of us and our subsidiaries for the trailing twelve month period ended on each such calculation date during the term of the Credit Agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreement also provides that it is an event of default if certain key persons (Richie Cunningham and Timothy Tyson) do not remain in certain positions with our company. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our Term Loans. If an event of default under our Credit Agreements occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them.\nIn connection with the entry into the Credit Agreements, on August 31, 2018, we issued to Perceptive a warrant (the Perceptive Warrant\u201d) to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock exercisable for a period of seven years at a per-share exercise price of $3.50, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the Perceptive Warrant for customary anti-dilution adjustments and price protection. Upon any exercise of the Perceptive Warrant, the exercise price is payable in cash or, at Perceptive's option, by withholding a number of shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant with an aggregate fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price.\nWe also granted Perceptive and GPB customary demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant and the GPB Warrant. At any time commencing nine months following the closing of a Qualifying PO (as defined in the Perceptive Warrant) if we are not qualified to register securities under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form), then upon the request of the holder(s) of at least 51% of the Perceptive Warrants and/or shares of common stock issuable thereunder (the Majority Holders\u201d), we are obligated, among other things, to (i) file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC within 90 days following the date on which the request is given for purposes of registering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrants, (ii) use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after filing, subject to any cut backs requested by the SEC, and (iii) maintain the registration until all registrable securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, without restriction as to volume.\nGPB Securities Purchase Agreement, Notes and Warrant\nOn May 15, 2017, we and Icagen-T entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the GPB Securities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with GPB Debt Holdings II, LLC ( GPB\u201d), pursuant to which (i) we issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to us of $1,920,000, before reimbursement of expenses: (a) a Senior Secured Convertible Note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the Parent Note\u201d), which Parent Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries other than Icagen-T, and (b) a warrant to purchase initially up to 857,143 shares of our common stock (the GPB Warrant\u201d) in accordance with the terms of the GPB Warrant; and (ii) Icagen-T issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to Icagen-T of $7,680,000, before reimbursement of expenses, a Senior Secured Convertible Note of Icagen-T (the Icagen-T Note\u201d and together with the Parent Note, the Notes\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000, which Icagen-T Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets, the assets of Icagen-T and the assets of our other subsidiaries. Each Note was issued with a four (4%) percent original issue discount. The Notes had a maturity date of May 15, 2020 and bore interest at a rate equal to 13% per annum. The Notes provided for prepayment upon payment of a specified prepayment penalty. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid $1,494,997 and $812,500 in interest payment under the Notes. In August 2018 we used $10,308,333 from the proceeds of the Term Loans to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Convertible Notes, including interest thereon of $108,333.\nWe also issued the GPB Warrant to GPB at an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments). The GPB Warrant expires on May 15, 2022. The GPB Warrant contains certain beneficial ownership limitations on exercise and also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions. If, at the time a holder exercises its GPB Warrant, there is no effective registration statement registering available for an issuance of the shares underlying the GPB Warrant to the holder, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the GPB Warrant. If we fail to timely deliver the shares underlying the GPB Warrant, we will be subject to certain buy-in provisions. The GPB Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the GPB Warrant) unless certain conditions specified therein are met. In addition, on August 31, 2018, the GPB Warrant was amended to provide to GPB piggyback registration rights upon the same terms as the Perceptive Warrant.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nAn analysis of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,199,706 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,998,561 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,798,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,439,011 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,523,429 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,994,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,346,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,352,459 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,355,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,175,352 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,530,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities was $(4,199,706) and $(9,998,561) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts and recovery of long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful life of plant and equipment and intangible assets, the valuation of certain assets and intangibles acquired from Pfizer, Inc. and assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets.\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against and by us or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, our management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue.\nWe have analyzed our revenue transactions pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue, and it has no material impact as a result of the transition from ASC 605 to 606. Our revenues are recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We derive our revenues from the sale of our services, as defined below. We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our revenue transactions:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>i. </td> <td>identify the contract with a customer; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ii. </td> <td>identify the performance obligations in the contract; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>iii. </td> <td>determine the transaction price; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>iv. </td> <td>allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>v. </td> <td>recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue sources consist of commercial revenues, deferred subsidy revenue, deferred revenue, multi-element collaboration agreements and government grants and contracts.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1) </td> <td>Commercial revenues </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe enter into fixed fee commercial development contracts that are associated with the delivery of feasible research on drug candidates and the development of drug candidates. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the development is performed.\nTable 118: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2) </td> <td>Deferred subsidy revenue </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the prior year, we had received certain deferred subsidy revenue which was utilized to support our operations, maintain the facilities that we operate in and continue the employment of certain employees to provide, if needed, resources to certain of our customers. This deferred subsidy revenue was amortized over a straight-line basis to match the expected expenses to be incurred over the period July 15, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nTable 119: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>3) </td> <td>Deferred revenue </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe received and will receive certain revenue in advance of services delivered. This revenue is deferred and only recognized when services have been performed in terms of master services agreements entered into with customers, together with their associated Statements of Work.\nTable 120: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>4) </td> <td>Multi-element collaboration agreements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into multiple-element collaboration contracts with customers and have determined that the different revenue generating elements embodied in these contracts are separable and there is sufficient evidence of the fair value of each element to account for these contract elements separately. These contracts elements include:\nTable 121: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>i. </td> <td>Upfront payments </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive upfront revenue payments, generally upon closing a collaboration agreement, these revenues are recognized over the expected initial contact timeline as outlined in the collaboration agreement.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>ii. </td> <td>Full Time Equivalent ( FTE\u201d) based research payments </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive ongoing revenue for FTE based time spent on the collaboration projects, this revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>iii. </td> <td>Development event payments </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon development events is recognized in the period that the development event is achieved. The achievement of a development event is when our collaboration partner agrees that the requirements stipulated in the agreement have been met.\nTable 124: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>iv. </td> <td>Sales based events </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue based on the achievement of certain calendar year net sales is recognized in the period that the sales achieved by our collaboration partner reach the thresholds as laid out in the agreement.\nTable 125: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>v. </td> <td>Royalties earned </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalties are earned at varying percentages of net product sales for certain periods as defined in our collaboration agreements, these royalties are recognized as revenue in the period in which a royalty report is received from our collaboration partners.\nResearch and Development\nThe remuneration of our research and development staff, materials used in internal research and development activities, and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements, are all expensed as incurred. Where we make a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received regulatory approval, the payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the patent life.\nShare-Based Compensation\nASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period or vesting period on a straight-line basis. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This estimate will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We have minimal awards with performance conditions and no awards dependent on market conditions.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe account for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.\u201d Measurement of share-based payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received\u037e or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.\nIntangible assets\nCertain of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Where intangibles are deemed to be impaired we recognize an impairment loss measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the intangible and its book value.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>1) </td> <td>Cell lines </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCell lines acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less any impairment. The useful life of cell lines is estimated to be indefinite.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>2) </td> <td>Discovery platform </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discovery platform acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and any impairment. The estimated useful life of the discovery platforms acquired is estimated to be ten years.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>3) </td> <td>Trademarks and trade names </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Trademarks and trade names acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less any impairments. The estimated useful life of trademarks and trade names is estimated to be indefinite.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>4) </td> <td>Patents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPatents acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and impairments. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years, the general useful life of patents.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>5) </td> <td>Assembled workforce </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssembled workforce acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less amortization and impairments. The estimated useful life of the assembled workforce is ten years.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>6) </td> <td>Amortization </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization is reported in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, unless the useful life is indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized from the date that they are available for use.\nPlant and equipment\nPlant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Leasehold improvements </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Laboratory equipment </td> <td>7 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Furniture and fixtures </td> <td>10 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Computer equipment </td> <td>3 Years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative liabilities\nWe have derivative financial instruments.\nASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re- measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nThe Black-Scholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the conversion options. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options.\nConversion options are recorded as debt discount and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument using effective interest method.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe recent Accounting Pronouncements are fully disclosed in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.\nClimate Change\nWe believe that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.", "item_7_truncated": "The Series C Warrants also contain certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions.\nThe change in operating assets and liabilities of $10,201,175 included i) the net movement in the deferred subsidy of $5,600,000, due to the amortization of the remaining subsidy received in the prior year; ii) an advanced payment on collaboration of $5,000,000 ; iii) an increase in accounts payable movements of $490,703; offset by (iv) a decrease in other payables and accruals of $1,198,698, primarily due to the reduction in bonus accruals during the current year.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $4,119,058, other current assets totaling $2,224,774 and total assets of $15,615,587. We had total current liabilities of $10,938,402 and a net working capital deficit of $4,594,570. Total liabilities were $34,973,296 including net deferred purchase consideration of $8,581,739. The deferred purchase consideration includes a net present value discount of $1,118,261 (made up of a gross present value discount of $2,468,700 less imputed interest movements of $1,350,439), the gross amount still due in terms of the acquisition agreement with Pfizer, Inc., is $9,700,000 after the payment of $300,000 to date, based on a potential earn out charge of the greater of (i) 10% of gross revenues commencing in January 2017 per quarter and (ii) $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum of $10,000,000 of which amounts in excess of $50,000 can be deferred and $200,000 was deferred for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 through to, December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, 56.2% of our revenue was derived from commercial revenues, 42.4% was derived from deferred subsidy revenue and 1.4% was generated from Government revenue. Despite generating funds from commercial customers and collaborations/partnerships, we continue to experience losses and during 2018 raised money from the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Term Loans and our Subordinated Notes in order to fund our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the $5,000,000 up front fee that we received from Roche and the $2,800,000 that we raised from our recent sale of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the $500,000 that we raised from the sale of our Subordinated Notes and the $15,250,000 that we raised from the sale of the Term Loans, of which $10,200,000 was used to repay our convertible debt, will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next four months. We will need to generate additional revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,791,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,880,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,088,550 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,906,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,228,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,322,245 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development salaries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,187,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,328,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,141,653 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,885,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,438,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,552,448 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Series C Warrants have an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe receive ongoing revenue for FTE based time spent on the collaboration projects, this revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.\nMore recently, we have begun to focus on partnership and collaboration opportunities with third parties, and we have entered into two such collaborations that provide us with an opportunity to derive revenue not only from our standard fees for integrated early discovery services but also from future milestone and royalty revenue from product candidates that may be developed and commercialized with our aid. We have developed in house a portfolio of assets targeting different indications that we believe would be ideal candidates for partnership opportunities.\n 39 \nDiscussions with respect to our operations included herein include the operations of our operating subsidiaries, Icagen Corp and Icagen-T, Inc. We have another two subsidiary companies, Caldera Discovery Inc. and XRpro Sciences Inc., which have always been dormant.\nOther expense was $562,524 and $262,966 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $299,558 or 113.9%. Other expense in the current period represents severance costs of $572,524 incurred in the restructure of our management and the streamlining of operations at our Tucson Facility and the release of a $10,000 legal settlement accrual no longer required. In the prior year, other expense represented severance costs on the reduction of our business development team by four heads.\nProfessional fees increased by $12,301, primarily due to an increase in payroll related fees based on the outsourcing of several payroll functions in order to improve the quality of service delivered to our employees.\nOther Expense\nOur revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue.\n iv. Sales based events \nRevenue based on the achievement of certain calendar year net sales is recognized in the period that the sales achieved by our collaboration partner reach the thresholds as laid out in the agreement.\nNet loss was $13,039,313 and $6,110,434 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the net loss is primarily due to the reduction in subsidy revenue and government contract revenue, an increase in interest expense and derivative liability movements, offset by a reduction in overall selling, general and administrative expenses, all discussed in detail above.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn our August 2018 debt financing with Perceptive, we received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $7,250,000 from the Icagen Term Loan and issued a warrant to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock (the Purchaser Warrants\u201d), and Icagen-T received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000 from the Icagen-T Term Loan. The Term Loans are secured by a security interest in all of our existing and future assets, subject to existing security interests and exceptions. The Term Loans require us and Icagen-T, respectively, among other things, to maintain the security interest, make monthly interest payments of approximately $160,000, make monthly installment payments of $152,500 after August 31, 2020 and meet various negative and affirmative covenants. If we or Icagen-T fails to comply with the terms of the Term Loans and/or the related agreements, the senior note holder could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, the secured creditor would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their Term Loans, subject to the first priority of our secured creditors. Any action by our secured or unsecured creditors to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations.\nWe received and will receive certain revenue in advance of services delivered. This revenue is deferred and only recognized when services have been performed in terms of master services agreements entered into with customers, together with their associated Statements of Work.\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.\nInflation\n 29 \nRevenues\nThe Term Loans contain, and our future indebtedness agreements may contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.

The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options.\nWe receive upfront revenue payments, generally upon closing a collaboration agreement, these revenues are recognized over the expected initial contact timeline as outlined in the collaboration agreement.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of our common stock and any other class or series of stock issued by us with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 12.0% per annum, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Powers, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock classifying the Series C Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation\u201d). The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into such number of shares of common stock as shall be equal to $3.50 plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series C Preferred Stock (the Accreted Value\u201d) divided by the conversion price, which initially shall be $3.50 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock based upon the then effective conversion price upon the (i) closing of a sale of shares of common stock to the public in a Qualifying Public Offering (as defined below) or a reverse merger into a publicly reporting company that has its common stock listed or quoted and traded on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation) or (ii) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Requisite Holders\u201d). A Qualifying Public Offering\u201d is defined as the first firm commitment underwritten public offering by us on or following the initial issuance date of the Series C Preferred Stock in which shares of common stock are sold for our account solely for cash to the public resulting in proceeds to it and/or our subsidiary, Icagen-T, Inc. of no less than $8,000,000 (after deduction only of underwriter discounts and commissions) and where the shares of common stock registered under the Securities Act, and sold in such public offering are simultaneously listed and commence trading on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation).\nTotal salary expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively is included in the following expense categories:\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn the prior year, we had received certain deferred subsidy revenue which was utilized to support our operations, maintain the facilities that we operate in and continue the employment of certain employees to provide, if needed, resources to certain of our customers. This deferred subsidy revenue was amortized over a straight-line basis to match the expected expenses to be incurred over the period July 15, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nDerivative liability movement was $(1,295,732) and $349,313 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1,645,045. The debit during the current year represents the mark to market of the derivative liability raised on the warrants issued to the term loan holders, the GBP warrants and the Series C Preferred stock warrants, all with variable pricing options and the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt whilst it was still outstanding.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practices ( US GAAP\u201d) requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts and recovery of long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful life of plant and equipment and intangible assets, the valuation of certain assets and intangibles acquired from Pfizer, Inc. and assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $2,352,459, primarily due to; i) the net decrease of $4,350,000 in funds raised from term loans in the current year and the repayment of convertible loans in the current year and raising of net cash proceeds on convertible loans in the prior year; ii) the $207,000 payment of penalties and legal fees incurred on the early settlement of the convertible loans; iii) the payment of capital raising fees on the term loans of $1,006,944; iv) the proceeds received from Series C Preferred Stock of $2,800,000; v) the net proceeds received of $500,000 on bridge loans and the repayment of $200,000 during the current year; and vi) the reduction in asset financing repayments of $269,251 over the prior year due to the full repayment of the Nanion Syncropatch asset financing liability during March 2018.\nAssembled workforce acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less amortization and impairments. The estimated useful life of the assembled workforce is ten years.\n 1) Commercial revenues \nSeries C Preferred Stock Financings\nThe payroll expense charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $2,322,245. This decrease is primarily due to the termination of the business development team in the prior year and the restructure of our management team at our Tucson site, together with a reduction in the overall bonus accrual for management.\n ii. Full Time Equivalent ( FTE\u201d) based research payments \nWe have a history of operating losses and net losses since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities and cash flows generated from government contracts and grants, settlement of lawsuits and more recently from debt funding, commercial customers and subsidy income. Although, we are generating revenue from commercial customers, we continue to experience losses and may need to raise additional funds in the future to meet our working capital requirements. To date, we have never generated sufficient cash from operations to pay our operating expenses. We have received $27,500,000 from Sanofi and despite the $4,500,000 we expect to derive from Icagen-T for services provided to Sanofi over the next eighteen months, we expect our expenses to increase as our operations expand and our expenses may continue to exceed such revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised an additional $2,800,000 through the issuance of shares of our Series C Preferred stock, an additional $500,000 through the issuance of Bridge Notes and a further $15,250,000 in Term Loans of which $10,200,000 was utilized to settle convertible debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, despite out fund raising efforts mentioned in the preceding sentence, we had not generated sufficient additional revenue from operations to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, including cash derived from the Series C Preferred Stock issued, the term loans and the bridge notes will not be sufficient to meet our operating needs for at least the next four months without additional revenue derived from operations or collaborations. If we should require additional capital, we may consider multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nCertain of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Where intangibles are deemed to be impaired we recognize an impairment loss measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the intangible and its book value.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $84,418 primarily due to a slight increase in capital expenditure offset by the reduction in cell lines purchased during the prior year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTerm Loans\nWe have entered into multiple-element collaboration contracts with customers and have determined that the different revenue generating elements embodied in these contracts are separable and there is sufficient evidence of the fair value of each element to account for these contract elements separately. These contracts elements include:\n 2) Discovery platform \nThe Series C Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity (as defined in the Series C Warrant) assumes in writing all of our obligations under the Series C Warrant and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the holders, including agreements to deliver to the in exchange for the Series C Warrants a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Series C Warrant; (ii) we or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) agrees at our election or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holders by paying to the holders cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series C Warrant); or (iii) a holder, at its election, requires us or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holder by paying to the holder cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreements also contain covenants requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain cash and cash equivalents held in one or more accounts subject to the first priority perfected security interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreements of not less than (a) $1,000,000 following the closing date until March 31, 2019, and (b) $1,500,000 at all times thereafter. The Credit Agreements also provide for specified quarterly minimum consolidated net revenue covenants of us and our subsidiaries for the trailing twelve month period ended on each such calculation date during the term of the Credit Agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreement also provides that it is an event of default if certain key persons (Richie Cunningham and Timothy Tyson) do not remain in certain positions with our company. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our Term Loans. If an event of default under our Credit Agreements occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them.\n \u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; \nAmortization expense was $378,148 and $224,984 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, an increase of $153,164 or 68.1%. The increase is due to the amortization of cell lines purchased at our Tucson Facility in the prior year. The remaining amortization charge relates primarily to the intangibles acquired at our Icagen NC site.\n i. Upfront payments \nIcagen is a drug discovery company with a focus in Neuroscience and Rare Disease. The Icagen platform is unique as it integrates our current state of the art drug discovery engine along with an artificial intelligence (AI) computational platform that enables an accelerated path to drug discovery.\nNet loss\nPlant and equipment\nPrior to our acquisition of the Icagen assets, substantially all of our revenue was derived from government grants related to the use of our XRpro technology. To date, we had been granted twenty-one grants and contracts from United States governmental agencies; of which nine were granted from the Department of Defense and twelve were granted from the National Institutes of Health. All grants and contracts have been completed and paid for in full.\nInterest expense totaled $3,190,730 and $2,282,046 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The interest expense is primarily made up of the following; (i) Imputed interest cost of $299,075 and $308,252 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9,177 or 3.0%, the imputed interest was adjusted in the prior year due to the reassessment of the length of time to repay the Pfizer deferred purchase consideration based on our future revenue projections and minimum payments we are required to make; (ii) amortization of debt discount of $1,229,994 and $1,110,424 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $119,570 or 10.8%, The debt discount represents the amortization of the valuation of the current year warrants issued in connection with our term loans, the debt issue costs associated with the current year term loans, the valuation of the conversion feature of the prior year Convertible Notes and the prior year warrants issued in connection with the Convertible Notes which is amortized over the term of the term loan and Convertible Notes. The valuation of the discount on the term loan amounted to $2,753,009 on a principal balance of $15,250,000 and the discount on the convertible note in the prior year amounted to $4,918,277 on a principal balance of $10,000,000; (iii) interest expense of $1,660,722 and $859,760 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $800,962, this increase is primarily due to us borrowing $10,000,000 in May 2017 and replacing that borrowing with a $15,250,000 facility on August 31, 2018, the interest expense was incurred for four and a half months longer in the current year and the quantum of the borrowing increased by $5,250,000. The coupon of the borrowing decreased slightly from 13% per annum to 9.75% plus one month Libor, which average is approximately 0.8% lower than the 13% on the convertible debt; and (iv) other of $939 and $3,610 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, this consists primarily on foreign exchange movements on purchases and sales to foreign suppliers and customers.\nFrom April 4, 2018 through August 27, 2018, we closed four tranches of our best efforts offering of preferred stock and warrants pursuant to which we issued to investors an aggregate of 28 units (the Series C Units\u201d), at a purchase price of $100,000 per unit, each unit consisting of approximately 28,571 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, and a seven year warrant (the Series C Warrant\u201d) to acquire approximately 28,571 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. An aggregate of 799,989 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 799,989 shares of common stock were sold at the four closings. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the Series C Units was approximately $2,800,000.\n 6) Amortization \nThe decrease in total salary expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $4,552,448 or 31.5% is primarily due to the restructure of our operations with the termination of our business development team due to the change on our market focus from CRO to early stage drug discovery in the prior year, a restructure of our management team and the streamlining of operations at our Tucson site. We also reduced our bonus accrual related to the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years to reflect the actual bonus liability.\nIn connection with the entry into the Credit Agreements, on August 31, 2018, we issued to Perceptive a warrant (the Perceptive Warrant\u201d) to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock exercisable for a period of seven years at a per-share exercise price of $3.50, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the Perceptive Warrant for customary anti-dilution adjustments and price protection. Upon any exercise of the Perceptive Warrant, the exercise price is payable in cash or, at Perceptive's option, by withholding a number of shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant with an aggregate fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price.\nCell lines acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less any impairment. The useful life of cell lines is estimated to be indefinite.\nRevenue contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon development events is recognized in the period that the development event is achieved. The achievement of a development event is when our collaboration partner agrees that the requirements stipulated in the agreement have been met.\nThe stock option compensation charge increased by $870,068. The charge for each period is dependent upon the number of options granted, any new options issued, the value of the options and the vesting schedule of these options. During the current year, 1,005,000 options to purchase shares of common stock were issued to our directors, executive officers and consultants. These options resulted in an increased expense in the current year as approximately 287,500 of these options vested immediately with the balance vesting over a period of twelve to thirty six months.\n 32 \nThe increase in net loss is discussed under net loss in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and includes a decrease in subsidy revenues received of $9,600,000.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our securities, settlement of legal matters and revenue we generate from the services we provide and upfront payments received from collaborations. We expect to continue to seek to obtain our required capital through the private sale of securities and revenue derived from the services we provide.\nThe change in adjustments for non-cash items of $2,526,559 is primarily due to; i) an increase in derivative liability movements of $1,645,045 due to the mark-to market adjustments made in each period; ii) the increase in stock based compensation charge of $870,068 primarily due to the number of options issued during the current year; iii) the increase in the amortization of debt discount of $437,023; and (iv) reversal of $500,000 of deferred purchase consideration in the prior year; offset by (v) the gain realized on debt extinguishment of $495,783 in the current year.\nASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re- measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.\nThe decrease in consulting fees of $36,692 is primarily due to the reduction in technical consulting expenses incurred at our Tucson Facility where an outside consultant assisted us with the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement, offset by an increase in administrative consulting expenses at corporate financial controller level.\nLegal fees decreased by $438,313 over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to legal expenditure incurred on the 2017 GPB convertible debt funding due to the complexity of the legal documentation and a current year reversal of legal fees recorded as due to Dentons on the settlement of all liabilities owing to them.\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nAs a result of the agreements that we entered into with Pfizer we are obligated; (i) make additional payments in terms of the Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with Pfizer including beginning in 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the Earn Out Payment\u201d) of 10% of revenue earned during the quarter, with a minimum payment of $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, such minimum being reduced to $50,000 for the quarters ending March 2017 to December 2018 and the difference between $250,000 or the quarterly amount paid and the actual calculation of deferred purchase consideration at 10% of gross revenue per quarter is being deferred and paid as one lump sum with the payment being made the quarter ended March 31, 2019, bearing interest at 12.5% per annum, which interest is payable quarterly; (ii) make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period July l, 2015 to April 30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $66,750, for the remainder of the lease period.\nEach holder of Series C Preferred Stock has the right to cast the number of votes equal to three times the number of shares into which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a group, have the right to elect one director on our Board of Directors. We cannot take the following actions without the approval of the Requisite Holders and the consent of our Board of Directors, including the Series C Preferred Stock director: (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business, (ii) amend our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (iii) create any new class of stock unless it ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and liquidation, (iv) amend or alter any class of stock pari passu with the Series C Preferred Stock to make it senior with respect to dividends and liquidation, (v) purchase or redeem any other shares of our stock, or (vi) increase the size of our Board of Directors.\nOur current plan is to purchase equipment and software to ensure that the Tucson Facility and the Icagen NC Facility function efficiently and that we are able to support the commercialization efforts of the Company. We anticipate that we would need to spend an additional $1,200,000 on necessary software and approximately $800,000 on equipment over the next twelve months.\nWe also granted Perceptive and GPB customary demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant and the GPB Warrant. At any time commencing nine months following the closing of a Qualifying PO (as defined in the Perceptive Warrant) if we are not qualified to register securities under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form), then upon the request of the holder(s) of at least 51% of the Perceptive Warrants and/or shares of common stock issuable thereunder (the Majority Holders\u201d), we are obligated, among other things, to (i) file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC within 90 days following the date on which the request is given for purposes of registering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrants, (ii) use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after filing, subject to any cut backs requested by the SEC, and (iii) maintain the registration until all registrable securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, without restriction as to volume.\nThe remuneration of our research and development staff, materials used in internal research and development activities, and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements, are all expensed as incurred. Where we make a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received regulatory approval, the payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the patent life.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $10,309,471 and $13,936,542 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $3,627,071 or 26.0%.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a preference on liquidation equal to $5.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Liquidity Event (as defined below), the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock can require us to redeem their shares of Series C Preferred Stock for a price per share equal to $5.25, subject to adjustments. In addition, we have the right to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred at any time for a price per share equal to $5.25 subject to adjustments. A Cash Liquidity Event\u201d is defined as the closing of any sale, lease or licensing transaction relating to a single asset or multiple assets other than in our ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to a sale of a building, sale of biological assets or other upfront payments, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds received by us at closing or closings in a transaction or transactions during any twelve (12) month period in excess of $40,000,000.\n \u25cf The salary expense included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively was $5,791,963 and $6,880,513, a decrease of $1,088,550 or 15.8%. This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel at our Tucson facility, a reduction in bonus accruals and the number of personnel working on Sanofi projects, partially offset by new business, including the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement. For additional information regarding salary expense reference is made to the discussion of total salary expense in selling, general and administrative expenses below. \n 1) Cell lines \nWe also issued the GPB Warrant to GPB at an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments). The GPB Warrant expires on May 15, 2022. The GPB Warrant contains certain beneficial ownership limitations on exercise and also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions. If, at the time a holder exercises its GPB Warrant, there is no effective registration statement registering available for an issuance of the shares underlying the GPB Warrant to the holder, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the GPB Warrant. If we fail to timely deliver the shares underlying the GPB Warrant, we will be subject to certain buy-in provisions. The GPB Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the GPB Warrant) unless certain conditions specified therein are met. In addition, on August 31, 2018, the GPB Warrant was amended to provide to GPB piggyback registration rights upon the same terms as the Perceptive Warrant.\n\nContingencies\nGain on debt extinguishment was $495,783 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain arose on the extinguishment of the GPB convertible debt on August 31, 2018 and represents the unamortized debt discount, the derivative liability related to the convertible debt conversion feature and expenses directly related to the debt extinguishment.\nClimate Change\nPursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold, we granted to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock certain demand registration and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain rights of our lender.\n 35 \nWe do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment.\nShould we not achieve our forecasted operating results, or should strategic opportunities present themselves such that additional financial resources would present attractive investing opportunities for us, we may decide in the future to issue debt or sell our equity securities in order to raise additional cash. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure any additional financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur.\nDerivative liability movement\n\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\nOther income was $15,779 and $502,494 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $486,715 or 96.9%, primarily made up of the prior year reversal of deferred purchase consideration initially due on the acquisition of Icagen NC, due to our customer not meeting certain revenue milestones.\nOverview and Financial Condition\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.\n 3) Deferred revenue \nOn May 15, 2017, we and Icagen-T entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the GPB Securities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with GPB Debt Holdings II, LLC ( GPB\u201d), pursuant to which (i) we issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to us of $1,920,000, before reimbursement of expenses: (a) a Senior Secured Convertible Note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the Parent Note\u201d), which Parent Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries other than Icagen-T, and (b) a warrant to purchase initially up to 857,143 shares of our common stock (the GPB Warrant\u201d) in accordance with the terms of the GPB Warrant; and (ii) Icagen-T issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to Icagen-T of $7,680,000, before reimbursement of expenses, a Senior Secured Convertible Note of Icagen-T (the Icagen-T Note\u201d and together with the Parent Note, the Notes\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000, which Icagen-T Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets, the assets of Icagen-T and the assets of our other subsidiaries. Each Note was issued with a four (4%) percent original issue discount. The Notes had a maturity date of May 15, 2020 and bore interest at a rate equal to 13% per annum. The Notes provided for prepayment upon payment of a specified prepayment penalty. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid $1,494,997 and $812,500 in interest payment under the Notes. In August 2018 we used $10,308,333 from the proceeds of the Term Loans to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Convertible Notes, including interest thereon of $108,333.\n 27 \n v. Royalties earned \nCapital raising fees of $76,000 related to the GBP debt were expensed in the prior year.\n \u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates \n 31 \nTotal salary expenses are allocated to the various expense categories detailed below depending on the level of activity of our employees on our commercial projects, internal research and development expenses and administrative activities. An increase in activity on projects will result in an increase in salary expense charged to cost of goods sold with a corresponding decrease in salary expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. A comparison of salary expenses is presented below.\nSubordinated Note Financings\nAs a result of the agreements that we entered into with Pfizer Research we have incurred significant obligations including the obligation: (i) make additional payments in terms of the Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with Pfizer including beginning in 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the Earn Out Payment\u201d) of 10% of revenue earned during the quarter, with a minimum payment of $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, such minimum being reduced to $50,000 for the quarters ending March 2017 to December 2018 and the difference between $250,000 or the quarterly amount paid and the actual calculation of deferred purchase consideration at 10% of gross revenue per quarter is being deferred and paid as one lump sum with the payment being made for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, bearing interest at 12.5% per annum, which interest is payable quarterly; (iii) make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period July l, 2015 to April 30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $66,950.\n \u25cf create liens; \nWe recognized depreciation expenses of $1,486,919 and $1,736,628 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $249,709 or 14.4%, which is primarily due to a reduction in the amount of laboratory software licensed during the current year. Software licenses are generally for a one year period and are amortized over the term of the license agreement. The balance of the depreciation expense is primarily made up of depreciation of our laboratory equipment and software licensing, which makes up the majority of our capital assets.\n\nFor the past three years, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization providing integrated drug discovery services with unique expertise in the field of ion channel, transporter, neuroscience and rare disease targets while also covering many other classes of drug discovery targets and therapeutic areas. Our customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to whom we offer our industry-leading scientific expertise and technologies to aid in their determination of which molecules to advance into late stage preclinical studies and ultimately clinical trials. The core of our offering is the discovery of pre-clinical drug candidates (PDC's), which are lead molecules (Leads) that are selected to enter into in-vivo studies during the pre-clinical phase of drug discovery. We offer a full complement of pre-clinical drug discovery services which include; assay development technologies (including high throughput fluorescence, manual and automated electrophysiology and radiotracer flux assays), cell line generation, high-throughput and ultra-high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and custom assay services to our customers. Our capabilities also include molecular biology and the use of complex functional assays, electrophysiology, bioanalytics and pharmacology. We believe that this integrated set of capabilities enhances our ability to help our customers identify drug candidates.\nOur business model is focused on research collaborations and partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and foundations who we partner with to support the discovery and development of innovative pharmaceuticals. These revenue-generating partnerships provide current funding while our co-owned pipeline of drug candidates provides the potential of additional significant long-term upside through milestone and royalty payments in new partnerships. The development and commercialization expense of these assets is being partially funded by our partners.\n 36 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nPatents acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and impairments. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years, the general useful life of patents.\nWe enter into fixed fee commercial development contracts that are associated with the delivery of feasible research on drug candidates and the development of drug candidates. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the development is performed.\nDirectors' cash fees remained the same as the prior year, with no increase in directors' headcount and with approved fees retained at prior year levels.\n \u25cf sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; \n \u25cf The laboratory supplies and direct materials included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively was $3,334,984 and $3,303,311, an increase of $31,673 or 1.0%, the slight increase is due to the nature of the work performed requiring more expensive seal chips partially offset by more effective cost control over general consumables. \nConversion options are recorded as debt discount and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument using effective interest method.\n 5) Assembled workforce \nOther expenses represent various insignificant individually insignificant expenses.\nGross profit was $3,672,649 and $11,480,918 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $7,808,269, or 68.0%. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the cessation of the Sanofi subsidy which amounted to $9,600,000 in the prior year, after factoring in the reduction of the subsidy revenue, the gross profit increased by $1,791,731, primarily due to reduced labor costs and a reduction in outside contractors costs, as discussed above and slightly more profitable business conducted during the current year.\n\nASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period or vesting period on a straight-line basis. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This estimate will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We have minimal awards with performance conditions and no awards dependent on market conditions.\nGPB Securities Purchase Agreement, Notes and Warrant\n \u25cf enter into mergers or consolidations; and \nRevenue recognition\nThe Trademarks and trade names acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less any impairments. The estimated useful life of trademarks and trade names is estimated to be indefinite.\n 28 \n\nWe continue to market our services to several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We believe that we now have a comprehensive product offering and substantial credibility to offer a full range of products including the advantages and value propositions of the XRpro\u00ae technology. While we are optimistic about our prospects, there can be no assurance about whether or when our products will generate sufficient revenues with adequate margins in order for us to be profitable.\n 34 \nPlant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nCost of goods sold totaled $9,910,569 and $11,175,692 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1,265,123 or 11.3%. Cost of goods sold is primarily comprised of direct expenses related to providing our services to our customers. These direct expenses include salary expenses directly related to our statements of work and research contracts including those of our scientific personnel expenses, recoverable expenses incurred on contracts, the cost of outside consultants, and direct materials used on our contracts.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nSubsequent to our acquisition of certain assets from Pfizer and Sanofi, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization from two commercial customers. We have also entered into Master Services Agreements ( MSA\u201d) with other various pharmaceutical companies where we have agreed to perform certain services for them.\nOther income\n 37 \n 38 \n 2) Deferred subsidy revenue \nCritical Accounting Policies\n 33 \nNet cash used in operating activities was $(4,199,706) and $(9,998,561) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following:\nFuture annual minimum payments required under operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2018, are as follows:\nCost of goods sold\n 4) Patents \nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDerivative liabilities\n iii. Development event payments \nDepreciation and Amortization\nIn addition, subject to limited exceptions, a holder of the Series C Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Series C Warrant if such holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined in the Series C Warrant). A holder of the Series C Warrant may adjust the Beneficial Ownership Limitation upon not less than sixty one (61) days' prior notice to us, provided that such Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event shall exceed 9.99%.\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against and by us or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, our management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.\n 3) Trademarks and trade names \nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017\nThis report and other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect,\u201d outlook,\u201d forecast,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d continue,\u201d sustain\u201d, on track\u201d, believe,\u201d seek,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d may,\u201d assume,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions are often used to identify such forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward- looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in our reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.\nThe recent Accounting Pronouncements are fully disclosed in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n \u25cf Outside contractors' cost included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, amounted to $783,622 and $991,868, a decrease of $208,246 or 21.0% is due to the reduction in the cost of outside laboratory maintenance contracts, primarily at our Tucson Facility. \n 30 \nWe account for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.\u201d Measurement of share-based payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received\u037e or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein. In addition to historical information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those expressed, implied or anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWe have analyzed our revenue transactions pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue, and it has no material impact as a result of the transition from ASC 605 to 606. Our revenues are recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We derive our revenues from the sale of our services, as defined below. We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our revenue transactions:\nAn analysis of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nIn addition, on August 13, 2018, we issued our 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 due on the earlier of: (x) the date that is twelve (12) months after its issue date or (y) our receipt of the proceeds of funding from our next collaboration/partnership. We also issued to the holders of the 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes five year warrants to purchase 1,500 shares of our common stock for each $10,000 principal amount invested at an exercise price of $3.50 per share (the Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The 10% Subordinated Note Warrants also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transaction. An aggregate of $500,000 in principal amount of 10% Subordinate Promissory Notes and Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 75,000 shares of common stock were sold at the closing. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the fifty (50) units was $500,000. 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $200,000 were repaid when we received the upfront payment from the Roche collaboration and 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $300,000 currently remain outstanding and are subordinated in certain respects to the Term Loans\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u25cf make other restricted payments including, without limitation, paying dividends and making investments; \n \u25cf incur, assume or guarantee additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Term Loans); \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had revenues totaling $13,583,218, all of which was from commercial revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenues totaling $22,656,610 ($12,735,867 of which was from commercial revenue, $9,600,000 was from subsidy revenue and $320,743 was from government grants), a decrease of $9,073,392 or 40.0%. The decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in deferred subsidy of $9,600,000, there was no deferred subsidy revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in government grants of $320,743, there was no government grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by an increase in commercial revenues of $847,351 or 6.7%. The decrease in revenue over the prior year is primarily attributable to the following; i) cessation of the subsidy revenue received from Sanofi initially to support the Tucson Facility, in the prior year; ii) the completion of the remaining National Institutes of Health government grant work during 2017; offset by iii) an increase in revenue at both our Tucson and North Carolina sites, including revenues received from our CFF collaboration agreement which offset the declining revenues from Sanofi. The upfront payment received from Roche will be recognized as revenue over a period of time commencing in January 2019.\nThe discovery platform acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and any impairment. The estimated useful life of the discovery platforms acquired is estimated to be ten years.\nWe have derivative financial instruments.", "item_7_text": "The Series C Warrants also contain certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions.\nThe change in operating assets and liabilities of $10,201,175 included i) the net movement in the deferred subsidy of $5,600,000, due to the amortization of the remaining subsidy received in the prior year; ii) an advanced payment on collaboration of $5,000,000 ; iii) an increase in accounts payable movements of $490,703; offset by (iv) a decrease in other payables and accruals of $1,198,698, primarily due to the reduction in bonus accruals during the current year.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash totaling $4,119,058, other current assets totaling $2,224,774 and total assets of $15,615,587. We had total current liabilities of $10,938,402 and a net working capital deficit of $4,594,570. Total liabilities were $34,973,296 including net deferred purchase consideration of $8,581,739. The deferred purchase consideration includes a net present value discount of $1,118,261 (made up of a gross present value discount of $2,468,700 less imputed interest movements of $1,350,439), the gross amount still due in terms of the acquisition agreement with Pfizer, Inc., is $9,700,000 after the payment of $300,000 to date, based on a potential earn out charge of the greater of (i) 10% of gross revenues commencing in January 2017 per quarter and (ii) $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum of $10,000,000 of which amounts in excess of $50,000 can be deferred and $200,000 was deferred for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 through to, December 31, 2018. The deferred amount bears interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum. Our stockholders' deficit amounted to $19,357,709.\nEstimates\nCash Flows\nIf, at the time a holder exercises its Series C Warrant, there is no effective registration statement registering for an issuance of the shares underlying the Series C Warrant to the holder, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Series C Warrant. If we fail to timely deliver the shares underlying the Series C Warrant, it will be subject to certain buy-in provisions.\nInterest expense\n \u25cf repurchase capital stock; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, 100% of our revenue was derived from commercial revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 56.2% of our revenue was derived from commercial revenues, 42.4% was derived from deferred subsidy revenue and 1.4% was generated from Government revenue. Despite generating funds from commercial customers and collaborations/partnerships, we continue to experience losses and during 2018 raised money from the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Term Loans and our Subordinated Notes in order to fund our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the $5,000,000 up front fee that we received from Roche and the $2,800,000 that we raised from our recent sale of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the $500,000 that we raised from the sale of our Subordinated Notes and the $15,250,000 that we raised from the sale of the Term Loans, of which $10,200,000 was used to repay our convertible debt, will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next four months. We will need to generate additional revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nThe Series C Warrants have an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments). The Series C Warrants expire seven (7) years after the issuance date.\nThe research and development salaries decreased by $1,141,653 primarily due to the streamlining of operations at our Tucson facility by the reduction in staff numbers and the level of scientific activity at both our Tucson Facility and our Icagen NC sites with new customers and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\nRevenue sources consist of commercial revenues, deferred subsidy revenue, deferred revenue, multi-element collaboration agreements and government grants and contracts.\nResearch and Development\nThe decrease in marketing expenditure over the prior period is primarily due a change in strategy with less reliance placed on developing a comprehensive Contract Research Organization ( CRO\u201d) business model, therefore less marketing effort was required during the current year. In the prior year, we had employed an outside marketing company to assist in messaging to our potential customers and developing a marketing strategy.\nTravel expenditure decreased by $138,234 due to the termination of our business development team during the prior year.\nOther Commitments\nFacilities expense decreased by $252,332 over the prior year, primarily due to the following movements; (i) a decrease in cleaning and janitorial expenses of $131,664 due to a restructure in our agreement with our building maintenance contractor at the Tucson Facility; (ii) a decrease in utility expense by $54,944, primarily due to reductions at our Tucson Facility due to better negotiated tariffs ; (iii) a decrease in Security services expenditure of $46,594 due to a restructure of our security costs at our Tucson Facility and; (iv) a reduction in site repairs and maintenance expenditure at our Tucson Facility of $19,130 due to the cancellation and streamlining of certain maintenance contacts.\nAmortization is reported in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, unless the useful life is indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized from the date that they are available for use.\nIntangible assets\nand 2017 Financings\n\nRoyalties are earned at varying percentages of net product sales for certain periods as defined in our collaboration agreements, these royalties are recognized as revenue in the period in which a royalty report is received from our collaboration partners.\nGross profit\n 4) Multi-element collaboration agreements \nWe believe that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe receive ongoing revenue for FTE based time spent on the collaboration projects, this revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.\nMore recently, we have begun to focus on partnership and collaboration opportunities with third parties, and we have entered into two such collaborations that provide us with an opportunity to derive revenue not only from our standard fees for integrated early discovery services but also from future milestone and royalty revenue from product candidates that may be developed and commercialized with our aid. We have developed in house a portfolio of assets targeting different indications that we believe would be ideal candidates for partnership opportunities.\n 39 \nDiscussions with respect to our operations included herein include the operations of our operating subsidiaries, Icagen Corp and Icagen-T, Inc. We have another two subsidiary companies, Caldera Discovery Inc. and XRpro Sciences Inc., which have always been dormant.\nOther expense was $562,524 and $262,966 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $299,558 or 113.9%. Other expense in the current period represents severance costs of $572,524 incurred in the restructure of our management and the streamlining of operations at our Tucson Facility and the release of a $10,000 legal settlement accrual no longer required. In the prior year, other expense represented severance costs on the reduction of our business development team by four heads.\nProfessional fees increased by $12,301, primarily due to an increase in payroll related fees based on the outsourcing of several payroll functions in order to improve the quality of service delivered to our employees.\nOther Expense\nOur revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue.\n iv. Sales based events \nRevenue based on the achievement of certain calendar year net sales is recognized in the period that the sales achieved by our collaboration partner reach the thresholds as laid out in the agreement.\nNet loss was $13,039,313 and $6,110,434 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the net loss is primarily due to the reduction in subsidy revenue and government contract revenue, an increase in interest expense and derivative liability movements, offset by a reduction in overall selling, general and administrative expenses, all discussed in detail above.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn our August 2018 debt financing with Perceptive, we received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $7,250,000 from the Icagen Term Loan and issued a warrant to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock (the Purchaser Warrants\u201d), and Icagen-T received advances in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000 from the Icagen-T Term Loan. The Term Loans are secured by a security interest in all of our existing and future assets, subject to existing security interests and exceptions. The Term Loans require us and Icagen-T, respectively, among other things, to maintain the security interest, make monthly interest payments of approximately $160,000, make monthly installment payments of $152,500 after August 31, 2020 and meet various negative and affirmative covenants. If we or Icagen-T fails to comply with the terms of the Term Loans and/or the related agreements, the senior note holder could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, the secured creditor would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their Term Loans, subject to the first priority of our secured creditors. Any action by our secured or unsecured creditors to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations.\nWe received and will receive certain revenue in advance of services delivered. This revenue is deferred and only recognized when services have been performed in terms of master services agreements entered into with customers, together with their associated Statements of Work.\nThe cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition.\nInflation\n 29 \nRevenues\nThe Term Loans contain, and our future indebtedness agreements may contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Term Loans restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\nThe major expenses making up selling, general and administrative expenses included the following:\nThe Black-Scholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the conversion options. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options.\nWe receive upfront revenue payments, generally upon closing a collaboration agreement, these revenues are recognized over the expected initial contact timeline as outlined in the collaboration agreement.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of our common stock and any other class or series of stock issued by us with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 12.0% per annum, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Powers, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock classifying the Series C Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation\u201d). The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into such number of shares of common stock as shall be equal to $3.50 plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series C Preferred Stock (the Accreted Value\u201d) divided by the conversion price, which initially shall be $3.50 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock automatically converts into shares of our common stock based upon the then effective conversion price upon the (i) closing of a sale of shares of common stock to the public in a Qualifying Public Offering (as defined below) or a reverse merger into a publicly reporting company that has its common stock listed or quoted and traded on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation) or (ii) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Requisite Holders\u201d). A Qualifying Public Offering\u201d is defined as the first firm commitment underwritten public offering by us on or following the initial issuance date of the Series C Preferred Stock in which shares of common stock are sold for our account solely for cash to the public resulting in proceeds to it and/or our subsidiary, Icagen-T, Inc. of no less than $8,000,000 (after deduction only of underwriter discounts and commissions) and where the shares of common stock registered under the Securities Act, and sold in such public offering are simultaneously listed and commence trading on a Trading Market (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation).\nTotal salary expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively is included in the following expense categories:\nWe examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn the prior year, we had received certain deferred subsidy revenue which was utilized to support our operations, maintain the facilities that we operate in and continue the employment of certain employees to provide, if needed, resources to certain of our customers. This deferred subsidy revenue was amortized over a straight-line basis to match the expected expenses to be incurred over the period July 15, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nDerivative liability movement was $(1,295,732) and $349,313 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1,645,045. The debit during the current year represents the mark to market of the derivative liability raised on the warrants issued to the term loan holders, the GBP warrants and the Series C Preferred stock warrants, all with variable pricing options and the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt whilst it was still outstanding.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practices ( US GAAP\u201d) requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts and recovery of long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful life of plant and equipment and intangible assets, the valuation of certain assets and intangibles acquired from Pfizer, Inc. and assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $2,352,459, primarily due to; i) the net decrease of $4,350,000 in funds raised from term loans in the current year and the repayment of convertible loans in the current year and raising of net cash proceeds on convertible loans in the prior year; ii) the $207,000 payment of penalties and legal fees incurred on the early settlement of the convertible loans; iii) the payment of capital raising fees on the term loans of $1,006,944; iv) the proceeds received from Series C Preferred Stock of $2,800,000; v) the net proceeds received of $500,000 on bridge loans and the repayment of $200,000 during the current year; and vi) the reduction in asset financing repayments of $269,251 over the prior year due to the full repayment of the Nanion Syncropatch asset financing liability during March 2018.\nAssembled workforce acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less amortization and impairments. The estimated useful life of the assembled workforce is ten years.\n 1) Commercial revenues \nSeries C Preferred Stock Financings\nThe payroll expense charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $2,322,245. This decrease is primarily due to the termination of the business development team in the prior year and the restructure of our management team at our Tucson site, together with a reduction in the overall bonus accrual for management.\n ii. Full Time Equivalent ( FTE\u201d) based research payments \nWe have a history of operating losses and net losses since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities and cash flows generated from government contracts and grants, settlement of lawsuits and more recently from debt funding, commercial customers and subsidy income. Although, we are generating revenue from commercial customers, we continue to experience losses and may need to raise additional funds in the future to meet our working capital requirements. To date, we have never generated sufficient cash from operations to pay our operating expenses. We have received $27,500,000 from Sanofi and despite the $4,500,000 we expect to derive from Icagen-T for services provided to Sanofi over the next eighteen months, we expect our expenses to increase as our operations expand and our expenses may continue to exceed such revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised an additional $2,800,000 through the issuance of shares of our Series C Preferred stock, an additional $500,000 through the issuance of Bridge Notes and a further $15,250,000 in Term Loans of which $10,200,000 was utilized to settle convertible debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, despite out fund raising efforts mentioned in the preceding sentence, we had not generated sufficient additional revenue from operations to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to this uncertainty. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, including cash derived from the Series C Preferred Stock issued, the term loans and the bridge notes will not be sufficient to meet our operating needs for at least the next four months without additional revenue derived from operations or collaborations. If we should require additional capital, we may consider multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nCertain of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Where intangibles are deemed to be impaired we recognize an impairment loss measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the intangible and its book value.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $84,418 primarily due to a slight increase in capital expenditure offset by the reduction in cell lines purchased during the prior year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTerm Loans\nWe have entered into multiple-element collaboration contracts with customers and have determined that the different revenue generating elements embodied in these contracts are separable and there is sufficient evidence of the fair value of each element to account for these contract elements separately. These contracts elements include:\n 2) Discovery platform \nThe Series C Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity (as defined in the Series C Warrant) assumes in writing all of our obligations under the Series C Warrant and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the holders, including agreements to deliver to the in exchange for the Series C Warrants a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Series C Warrant; (ii) we or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) agrees at our election or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holders by paying to the holders cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series C Warrant); or (iii) a holder, at its election, requires us or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) to purchase the Series C Warrant from the holder by paying to the holder cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreements also contain covenants requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain cash and cash equivalents held in one or more accounts subject to the first priority perfected security interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreements of not less than (a) $1,000,000 following the closing date until March 31, 2019, and (b) $1,500,000 at all times thereafter. The Credit Agreements also provide for specified quarterly minimum consolidated net revenue covenants of us and our subsidiaries for the trailing twelve month period ended on each such calculation date during the term of the Credit Agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreement also provides that it is an event of default if certain key persons (Richie Cunningham and Timothy Tyson) do not remain in certain positions with our company. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our Term Loans. If an event of default under our Credit Agreements occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them.\n \u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; \nAmortization expense was $378,148 and $224,984 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, an increase of $153,164 or 68.1%. The increase is due to the amortization of cell lines purchased at our Tucson Facility in the prior year. The remaining amortization charge relates primarily to the intangibles acquired at our Icagen NC site.\n i. Upfront payments \nIcagen is a drug discovery company with a focus in Neuroscience and Rare Disease. The Icagen platform is unique as it integrates our current state of the art drug discovery engine along with an artificial intelligence (AI) computational platform that enables an accelerated path to drug discovery.\nNet loss\nPlant and equipment\nPrior to our acquisition of the Icagen assets, substantially all of our revenue was derived from government grants related to the use of our XRpro technology. To date, we had been granted twenty-one grants and contracts from United States governmental agencies; of which nine were granted from the Department of Defense and twelve were granted from the National Institutes of Health. All grants and contracts have been completed and paid for in full.\nInterest expense totaled $3,190,730 and $2,282,046 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The interest expense is primarily made up of the following; (i) Imputed interest cost of $299,075 and $308,252 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9,177 or 3.0%, the imputed interest was adjusted in the prior year due to the reassessment of the length of time to repay the Pfizer deferred purchase consideration based on our future revenue projections and minimum payments we are required to make; (ii) amortization of debt discount of $1,229,994 and $1,110,424 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $119,570 or 10.8%, The debt discount represents the amortization of the valuation of the current year warrants issued in connection with our term loans, the debt issue costs associated with the current year term loans, the valuation of the conversion feature of the prior year Convertible Notes and the prior year warrants issued in connection with the Convertible Notes which is amortized over the term of the term loan and Convertible Notes. The valuation of the discount on the term loan amounted to $2,753,009 on a principal balance of $15,250,000 and the discount on the convertible note in the prior year amounted to $4,918,277 on a principal balance of $10,000,000; (iii) interest expense of $1,660,722 and $859,760 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $800,962, this increase is primarily due to us borrowing $10,000,000 in May 2017 and replacing that borrowing with a $15,250,000 facility on August 31, 2018, the interest expense was incurred for four and a half months longer in the current year and the quantum of the borrowing increased by $5,250,000. The coupon of the borrowing decreased slightly from 13% per annum to 9.75% plus one month Libor, which average is approximately 0.8% lower than the 13% on the convertible debt; and (iv) other of $939 and $3,610 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, this consists primarily on foreign exchange movements on purchases and sales to foreign suppliers and customers.\nFrom April 4, 2018 through August 27, 2018, we closed four tranches of our best efforts offering of preferred stock and warrants pursuant to which we issued to investors an aggregate of 28 units (the Series C Units\u201d), at a purchase price of $100,000 per unit, each unit consisting of approximately 28,571 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, and a seven year warrant (the Series C Warrant\u201d) to acquire approximately 28,571 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. An aggregate of 799,989 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series C Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 799,989 shares of common stock were sold at the four closings. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the Series C Units was approximately $2,800,000.\n 6) Amortization \nThe decrease in total salary expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $4,552,448 or 31.5% is primarily due to the restructure of our operations with the termination of our business development team due to the change on our market focus from CRO to early stage drug discovery in the prior year, a restructure of our management team and the streamlining of operations at our Tucson site. We also reduced our bonus accrual related to the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years to reflect the actual bonus liability.\nIn connection with the entry into the Credit Agreements, on August 31, 2018, we issued to Perceptive a warrant (the Perceptive Warrant\u201d) to purchase 723,550 shares of our common stock exercisable for a period of seven years at a per-share exercise price of $3.50, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the Perceptive Warrant for customary anti-dilution adjustments and price protection. Upon any exercise of the Perceptive Warrant, the exercise price is payable in cash or, at Perceptive's option, by withholding a number of shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant with an aggregate fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price.\nCell lines acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less any impairment. The useful life of cell lines is estimated to be indefinite.\nRevenue contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon development events is recognized in the period that the development event is achieved. The achievement of a development event is when our collaboration partner agrees that the requirements stipulated in the agreement have been met.\nThe stock option compensation charge increased by $870,068. The charge for each period is dependent upon the number of options granted, any new options issued, the value of the options and the vesting schedule of these options. During the current year, 1,005,000 options to purchase shares of common stock were issued to our directors, executive officers and consultants. These options resulted in an increased expense in the current year as approximately 287,500 of these options vested immediately with the balance vesting over a period of twelve to thirty six months.\n 32 \nThe increase in net loss is discussed under net loss in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and includes a decrease in subsidy revenues received of $9,600,000.\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our securities, settlement of legal matters and revenue we generate from the services we provide and upfront payments received from collaborations. We expect to continue to seek to obtain our required capital through the private sale of securities and revenue derived from the services we provide.\nThe change in adjustments for non-cash items of $2,526,559 is primarily due to; i) an increase in derivative liability movements of $1,645,045 due to the mark-to market adjustments made in each period; ii) the increase in stock based compensation charge of $870,068 primarily due to the number of options issued during the current year; iii) the increase in the amortization of debt discount of $437,023; and (iv) reversal of $500,000 of deferred purchase consideration in the prior year; offset by (v) the gain realized on debt extinguishment of $495,783 in the current year.\nASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re- measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.\nThe decrease in consulting fees of $36,692 is primarily due to the reduction in technical consulting expenses incurred at our Tucson Facility where an outside consultant assisted us with the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement, offset by an increase in administrative consulting expenses at corporate financial controller level.\nLegal fees decreased by $438,313 over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to legal expenditure incurred on the 2017 GPB convertible debt funding due to the complexity of the legal documentation and a current year reversal of legal fees recorded as due to Dentons on the settlement of all liabilities owing to them.\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nAs a result of the agreements that we entered into with Pfizer we are obligated; (i) make additional payments in terms of the Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with Pfizer including beginning in 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the Earn Out Payment\u201d) of 10% of revenue earned during the quarter, with a minimum payment of $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, such minimum being reduced to $50,000 for the quarters ending March 2017 to December 2018 and the difference between $250,000 or the quarterly amount paid and the actual calculation of deferred purchase consideration at 10% of gross revenue per quarter is being deferred and paid as one lump sum with the payment being made the quarter ended March 31, 2019, bearing interest at 12.5% per annum, which interest is payable quarterly; (ii) make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period July l, 2015 to April 30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $66,750, for the remainder of the lease period.\nEach holder of Series C Preferred Stock has the right to cast the number of votes equal to three times the number of shares into which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a group, have the right to elect one director on our Board of Directors. We cannot take the following actions without the approval of the Requisite Holders and the consent of our Board of Directors, including the Series C Preferred Stock director: (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business, (ii) amend our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (iii) create any new class of stock unless it ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and liquidation, (iv) amend or alter any class of stock pari passu with the Series C Preferred Stock to make it senior with respect to dividends and liquidation, (v) purchase or redeem any other shares of our stock, or (vi) increase the size of our Board of Directors.\nOur current plan is to purchase equipment and software to ensure that the Tucson Facility and the Icagen NC Facility function efficiently and that we are able to support the commercialization efforts of the Company. We anticipate that we would need to spend an additional $1,200,000 on necessary software and approximately $800,000 on equipment over the next twelve months.\nWe also granted Perceptive and GPB customary demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrant and the GPB Warrant. At any time commencing nine months following the closing of a Qualifying PO (as defined in the Perceptive Warrant) if we are not qualified to register securities under the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form), then upon the request of the holder(s) of at least 51% of the Perceptive Warrants and/or shares of common stock issuable thereunder (the Majority Holders\u201d), we are obligated, among other things, to (i) file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC within 90 days following the date on which the request is given for purposes of registering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Perceptive Warrants, (ii) use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after filing, subject to any cut backs requested by the SEC, and (iii) maintain the registration until all registrable securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, without restriction as to volume.\nThe remuneration of our research and development staff, materials used in internal research and development activities, and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements, are all expensed as incurred. Where we make a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received regulatory approval, the payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the patent life.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $10,309,471 and $13,936,542 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $3,627,071 or 26.0%.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to a preference on liquidation equal to $5.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Liquidity Event (as defined below), the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock can require us to redeem their shares of Series C Preferred Stock for a price per share equal to $5.25, subject to adjustments. In addition, we have the right to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred at any time for a price per share equal to $5.25 subject to adjustments. A Cash Liquidity Event\u201d is defined as the closing of any sale, lease or licensing transaction relating to a single asset or multiple assets other than in our ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to a sale of a building, sale of biological assets or other upfront payments, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds received by us at closing or closings in a transaction or transactions during any twelve (12) month period in excess of $40,000,000.\n \u25cf The salary expense included in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively was $5,791,963 and $6,880,513, a decrease of $1,088,550 or 15.8%. This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel at our Tucson facility, a reduction in bonus accruals and the number of personnel working on Sanofi projects, partially offset by new business, including the Cystic Fibrosis collaboration agreement. For additional information regarding salary expense reference is made to the discussion of total salary expense in selling, general and administrative expenses below. \n 1) Cell lines \nWe also issued the GPB Warrant to GPB at an initial exercise price of $3.50 per share (subject to applicable adjustments). The GPB Warrant expires on May 15, 2022. The GPB Warrant contains certain beneficial ownership limitations on exercise and also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization and issuances of securities at prices below the conversion price or similar transactions. If, at the time a holder exercises its GPB Warrant, there is no effective registration statement registering available for an issuance of the shares underlying the GPB Warrant to the holder, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the GPB Warrant. If we fail to timely deliver the shares underlying the GPB Warrant, we will be subject to certain buy-in provisions. The GPB Warrant also provides that we will not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the GPB Warrant) unless certain conditions specified therein are met. In addition, on August 31, 2018, the GPB Warrant was amended to provide to GPB piggyback registration rights upon the same terms as the Perceptive Warrant.\n\nContingencies\nGain on debt extinguishment was $495,783 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain arose on the extinguishment of the GPB convertible debt on August 31, 2018 and represents the unamortized debt discount, the derivative liability related to the convertible debt conversion feature and expenses directly related to the debt extinguishment.\nClimate Change\nPursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Series C Units were sold, we granted to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock certain demand registration and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain rights of our lender.\n 35 \nWe do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment.\nShould we not achieve our forecasted operating results, or should strategic opportunities present themselves such that additional financial resources would present attractive investing opportunities for us, we may decide in the future to issue debt or sell our equity securities in order to raise additional cash. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure any additional financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur.\nDerivative liability movement\n\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\nOther income was $15,779 and $502,494 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $486,715 or 96.9%, primarily made up of the prior year reversal of deferred purchase consideration initially due on the acquisition of Icagen NC, due to our customer not meeting certain revenue milestones.\nOverview and Financial Condition\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.\n 3) Deferred revenue \nOn May 15, 2017, we and Icagen-T entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the GPB Securities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with GPB Debt Holdings II, LLC ( GPB\u201d), pursuant to which (i) we issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to us of $1,920,000, before reimbursement of expenses: (a) a Senior Secured Convertible Note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the Parent Note\u201d), which Parent Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries other than Icagen-T, and (b) a warrant to purchase initially up to 857,143 shares of our common stock (the GPB Warrant\u201d) in accordance with the terms of the GPB Warrant; and (ii) Icagen-T issued to GPB for an aggregate purchase price payable in cash to Icagen-T of $7,680,000, before reimbursement of expenses, a Senior Secured Convertible Note of Icagen-T (the Icagen-T Note\u201d and together with the Parent Note, the Notes\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000, which Icagen-T Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.50 per share and secured by a lien on all of our assets, the assets of Icagen-T and the assets of our other subsidiaries. Each Note was issued with a four (4%) percent original issue discount. The Notes had a maturity date of May 15, 2020 and bore interest at a rate equal to 13% per annum. The Notes provided for prepayment upon payment of a specified prepayment penalty. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid $1,494,997 and $812,500 in interest payment under the Notes. In August 2018 we used $10,308,333 from the proceeds of the Term Loans to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Convertible Notes, including interest thereon of $108,333.\n 27 \n v. Royalties earned \nCapital raising fees of $76,000 related to the GBP debt were expensed in the prior year.\n \u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates \n 31 \nTotal salary expenses are allocated to the various expense categories detailed below depending on the level of activity of our employees on our commercial projects, internal research and development expenses and administrative activities. An increase in activity on projects will result in an increase in salary expense charged to cost of goods sold with a corresponding decrease in salary expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. A comparison of salary expenses is presented below.\nSubordinated Note Financings\nAs a result of the agreements that we entered into with Pfizer Research we have incurred significant obligations including the obligation: (i) make additional payments in terms of the Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with Pfizer including beginning in 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the Earn Out Payment\u201d) of 10% of revenue earned during the quarter, with a minimum payment of $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, such minimum being reduced to $50,000 for the quarters ending March 2017 to December 2018 and the difference between $250,000 or the quarterly amount paid and the actual calculation of deferred purchase consideration at 10% of gross revenue per quarter is being deferred and paid as one lump sum with the payment being made for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, bearing interest at 12.5% per annum, which interest is payable quarterly; (iii) make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period July l, 2015 to April 30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $66,950.\n \u25cf create liens; \nWe recognized depreciation expenses of $1,486,919 and $1,736,628 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $249,709 or 14.4%, which is primarily due to a reduction in the amount of laboratory software licensed during the current year. Software licenses are generally for a one year period and are amortized over the term of the license agreement. The balance of the depreciation expense is primarily made up of depreciation of our laboratory equipment and software licensing, which makes up the majority of our capital assets.\n\nFor the past three years, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization providing integrated drug discovery services with unique expertise in the field of ion channel, transporter, neuroscience and rare disease targets while also covering many other classes of drug discovery targets and therapeutic areas. Our customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to whom we offer our industry-leading scientific expertise and technologies to aid in their determination of which molecules to advance into late stage preclinical studies and ultimately clinical trials. The core of our offering is the discovery of pre-clinical drug candidates (PDC's), which are lead molecules (Leads) that are selected to enter into in-vivo studies during the pre-clinical phase of drug discovery. We offer a full complement of pre-clinical drug discovery services which include; assay development technologies (including high throughput fluorescence, manual and automated electrophysiology and radiotracer flux assays), cell line generation, high-throughput and ultra-high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and custom assay services to our customers. Our capabilities also include molecular biology and the use of complex functional assays, electrophysiology, bioanalytics and pharmacology. We believe that this integrated set of capabilities enhances our ability to help our customers identify drug candidates.\nOur business model is focused on research collaborations and partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and foundations who we partner with to support the discovery and development of innovative pharmaceuticals. These revenue-generating partnerships provide current funding while our co-owned pipeline of drug candidates provides the potential of additional significant long-term upside through milestone and royalty payments in new partnerships. The development and commercialization expense of these assets is being partially funded by our partners.\n 36 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nPatents acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and impairments.

The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the cessation of the Sanofi subsidy which amounted to $9,600,000 in the prior year, after factoring in the reduction of the subsidy revenue, the gross profit increased by $1,791,731, primarily due to reduced labor costs and a reduction in outside contractors costs, as discussed above and slightly more profitable business conducted during the current year.\n\nASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period or vesting period on a straight-line basis. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This estimate will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Cost of goods sold is primarily comprised of direct expenses related to providing our services to our customers. These direct expenses include salary expenses directly related to our statements of work and research contracts including those of our scientific personnel expenses, recoverable expenses incurred on contracts, the cost of outside consultants, and direct materials used on our contracts.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nSubsequent to our acquisition of certain assets from Pfizer and Sanofi, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from our operations as a partner research organization from two commercial customers.

Our revenues are recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We derive our revenues from the sale of our services, as defined below. We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our revenue transactions:\nAn analysis of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nIn addition, on August 13, 2018, we issued our 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 due on the earlier of: (x) the date that is twelve (12) months after its issue date or (y) our receipt of the proceeds of funding from our next collaboration/partnership. We also issued to the holders of the 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes five year warrants to purchase 1,500 shares of our common stock for each $10,000 principal amount invested at an exercise price of $3.50 per share (the Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The 10% Subordinated Note Warrants also contains certain anti-dilution provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transaction. An aggregate of $500,000 in principal amount of 10% Subordinate Promissory Notes and Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 75,000 shares of common stock were sold at the closing. The gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the fifty (50) units was $500,000. 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $200,000 were repaid when we received the upfront payment from the Roche collaboration and 10% Subordinated Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $300,000 currently remain outstanding and are subordinated in certain respects to the Term Loans\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u25cf make other restricted payments including, without limitation, paying dividends and making investments; \n \u25cf incur, assume or guarantee additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Term Loans); \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had revenues totaling $13,583,218, all of which was from commercial revenues and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenues totaling $22,656,610 ($12,735,867 of which was from commercial revenue, $9,600,000 was from subsidy revenue and $320,743 was from government grants), a decrease of $9,073,392 or 40.0%. The decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in deferred subsidy of $9,600,000, there was no deferred subsidy revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in government grants of $320,743, there was no government grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by an increase in commercial revenues of $847,351 or 6.7%. The decrease in revenue over the prior year is primarily attributable to the following; i) cessation of the subsidy revenue received from Sanofi initially to support the Tucson Facility, in the prior year; ii) the completion of the remaining National Institutes of Health government grant work during 2017; offset by iii) an increase in revenue at both our Tucson and North Carolina sites, including revenues received from our CFF collaboration agreement which offset the declining revenues from Sanofi. The upfront payment received from Roche will be recognized as revenue over a period of time commencing in January 2019.\nThe discovery platform acquired by us is reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and any impairment.

"summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Icagen is a drug discovery company focused on neuroscience and rare diseases. It has an integrated drug discovery platform and expertise in ion channels, transporters, and other drug targets.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- Despite generating some revenue from customers and collaborations, Icagen continues to operate at a loss and rely on financing activities to fund operations. It raised $2.8M from Series C preferred stock, $0.5M from bridge notes, and $15.25M from term loans in 2018. There is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nRevenue\n- Total revenue for 2018 was $13.6M compared to $22.7M in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.6M decrease in subsidy revenue from Sanofi. Commercial revenue increased slightly.  \n\nExpenses \n- R&D and SG&A expenses decreased due to restructuring and streamlining of operations. This resulted in lower payroll, contractor, marketing, legal, and other costs.\n\nNet Loss\n- Net loss for 2018 was $13M compared to $6.1M in 2017. The wider loss was primarily attributable to decreased subsidy revenue, increased interest expense, and derivative liability movements.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash used in operations was lower mainly due to changes in working capital. Cash from financing decreased after repaying debt. Concerns remain about Icagen's liquidity and ability to meet working capital requirements.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"}
