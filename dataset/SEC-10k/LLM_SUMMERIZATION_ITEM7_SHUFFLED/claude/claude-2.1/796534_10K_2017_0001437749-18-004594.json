We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the description of our Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\nIf the national economy or the Company's market area experience a downturn, it is likely that unemployment will rise and that other economic indicators will negatively impact the Company's trade area. Because of the importance to the Company's markets of state-funded universities, cutbacks in the funding provided by the Commonwealth could also negatively impact employment. This could lead to a higher rate of delinquent loans and a greater number of real estate foreclosures. Higher unemployment and the fear of layoffs causes reduced consumer demand for goods and services, which negatively impacts the Company's business and professional customers. An economic downturn could have an adverse effect on all financial institutions, including the Company.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. Although the economics of the Company's transactions may not change, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance is funded by the provision for loan losses, reduced by charge-offs of loans and increased by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. The determination of the allowance is based on two accounting principles, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450-20 (Contingencies) which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, and ASC Topic 310-10 (Receivables) which requires accrual of losses on impaired loans if the recorded investment exceeds fair value.\nProbable losses are accrued through two calculations, individual evaluation of impaired loans and collective evaluation of the remainder of the portfolio. Impaired loans are larger non-homogeneous loans for which there is a probability that collection will not occur according to the loan terms, as well as loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Impaired loans that are not TDR's with an estimated impairment loss are placed on nonaccrual status. TDR's with an impairment loss may accrue interest if they have demonstrated six months of timely payment performance.\nImpaired loans\nImpaired loans are identified through the Company's credit risk rating process. Estimated loss for an impaired loan is the amount of recorded investment that exceeds the loan's fair value. Fair value of an impaired loan is measured by one of three methods: the fair value of collateral ( collateral method\u201d), the present value of future cash flows ( cash flow method\u201d), or observable market price. The Company applies the collateral method to collateral-dependent loans, loans for which foreclosure is imminent and to loans for which the fair value of collateral is a more reliable estimate of fair value. The cash flow method is applied to loans that are not collateral dependent and for which cash flows may be estimated.\nThe Company bases collateral method fair valuation upon the as-is\u201d value of independent appraisals or evaluations. Valuations for impaired loans with outstanding principal balances of $250 or more are based on a current appraisal. Appraisals are also used to value impaired loans with principal balances of $100 or greater and secured by one piece of collateral. Collateral-method impaired loans with principal balances below $100, or if secured by multiple pieces of collateral, below $250, are valued using an internal evaluation.\nAppraisals and internal valuations provide an estimate of market value. Appraisals must conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice ( USPAP\u201d) and are prepared by an independent third-party appraiser who is certified and licensed and who is approved by the Company. Appraisals may incorporate market analysis, comparable sales analysis, cash flow analysis and market data pertinent to the property to determine market value.\nInternal evaluations are prepared by third party providers and reviewed by employees of the Company who are independent of the loan origination, operation, management and collection functions. Evaluations provide a property's market value based on the property's current physical condition and characteristics and the economic market conditions that affect the collateral's market value. Evaluations incorporate multiple sources of data to arrive at a property's market value, including physical inspection, independent third-party automated tools, comparable sales analysis and local market information.\nUpdated appraisals or evaluations are ordered when the loan becomes impaired if the appraisal or evaluation on file is more than twelve months old. Appraisals and evaluations are reviewed for propriety and reasonableness and may be discounted if the Company determines that the value exceeds reasonable levels. If an updated appraisal or evaluation has been ordered but has not been received by a reporting date, the fair value may be based on the most recent available appraisal or evaluation, discounted for age.\nThe appraisal or evaluation value for a collateral-dependent loan for which recovery is expected solely from the sale of collateral is reduced by estimated selling costs. Estimated losses on collateral-dependent loans, as well as any other impairment loss considered uncollectible, are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Impairment losses that are not considered uncollectible or for loans that are not collateral dependent are accrued in the allowance. Impaired loans with partial charge-offs are maintained as impaired until the remaining balance is satisfied. Smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and are not part of a larger impaired relationship are collectively evaluated.\nTroubled debt restructurings are impaired loans and are measured for impairment under the same valuation methods as other impaired loans. Troubled debt restructurings are maintained in nonaccrual status until the loan has demonstrated reasonable assurance of repayment with at least six months of consecutive timely payment performance.\nCollectively-evaluated loans\nNon-impaired loans and smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and not part of a larger impaired relationship are grouped by portfolio segments. Portfolio segments are further divided into smaller loan classes. Loans within a segment or class have similar risk characteristics.\nProbable loss is determined by applying historical net charge-off rates as well as additional percentages for trends and current levels of quantitative and qualitative factors. Loss rates are calculated for and applied to individual classes by averaging loss rates over the most recent 8 quarters. The look-back period of 8 quarters is applied consistently among all classes.\nTwo loss rates for each class are calculated: total net charge-offs for the class as a percentage of average class loan balance ( class loss rate\u201d), and total net charge-offs for the class as a percentage of average classified loans in the class ( classified loss rate\u201d). Classified loans are those with risk ratings that indicate credit quality is substandard\u201d, doubtful\u201d or loss\u201d. Net charge-offs in both calculations include charge-offs and recoveries of classified and non-classified loans as well as those associated with impaired loans. Class historical loss rates are applied to collectively-evaluated non-classified loan balances, and classified historical loss rates are applied to collectively-evaluated classified loan balances.\nQualitative factors are evaluated and allocations are applied to each class. Qualitative factors include delinquency rates, loan quality and concentrations, loan officers' experience, changes in lending policies and changes in the loan review process. Economic factors such as unemployment rates, bankruptcy rates and others are evaluated, with standard allocations applied consistently to relevant classes.\nThe Company accrues additional allocations for criticized loans within each class and for loans designated high risk. Criticized loans include classified loans as well as loans rated special mention\u201d. Loans rated special mention indicate weakened credit quality but to a lesser degree than classified loans. High risk loans are defined as junior lien mortgages, loans with high loan-to-value ratios and loans with terms that require interest only payments. Both criticized loans and high risk loans are included in the base risk analysis for each class and are allocated additional reserves.\nEstimation of the allowance for loan losses\nThe estimation of the allowance involves analysis of internal and external variables, methodologies, assumptions and our judgment and experience. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for loan losses include internal risk rating determinations, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions. These judgments are inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimate. Future estimates of the allowance could increase or decrease based on changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, concentrations of various types of loans, economic conditions or the markets in which collateral may be sold. The estimate of the allowance accrual determines the amount of provision expense and directly affects our financial results.\nThe estimate of the allowance for December 31, 2017 considered market and portfolio conditions during 2017 as well as the levels of delinquencies and net charge-offs in the eight quarters prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2017. If the economy experiences a downturn, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. For additional discussion of the allowance, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Asset Quality,\u201d and Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. The Company performs impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company's most recent impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accounting guidance provides the option of performing preliminary assessment of qualitative factors before performing more substantial testing for impairment. The Company opted not to perform the preliminary assessment. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis considered three valuation techniques appropriate to the measurement. The first technique uses the Company's market capitalization as an estimate of fair value; the second technique estimates fair value using current market pricing multiples for companies comparable to the Company; while the third technique uses current market pricing multiples for change-of-control transactions involving companies comparable to the Company. Each measure indicated that the Company's fair value exceeded its book value, validating that goodwill is not impaired.\nCertain key judgments were used in the valuation measurement. Goodwill is held by the Company's bank subsidiary. The bank subsidiary is 100% owned by the Company, and no market capitalization is available. Because most of the Company's assets are comprised of the subsidiary bank's equity, the Company's market capitalization was used to estimate the Bank's market capitalization. Other judgments include the assumption that the companies and transactions used as comparables for the second and third technique were appropriate to the estimate of the Company's fair value, and that the comparable multiples are appropriate indicators of fair value, and compliant with accounting guidance.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\nReal estate acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure is held for sale and is stated at fair value of the property, less estimated disposal costs, if any. Any excess of cost over the fair value less costs to sell at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The fair value is reviewed periodically by management and any write-downs are charged against current earnings. Accounting policy and treatment is consistent with accounting for impaired loans described above.\nPension Plan\nThe Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the estimated return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nOther Than Temporary Impairment of Securities ( OTTI\u201d)\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) the Company intends to sell the security or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, the Company must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. The Company regularly reviews each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, the Company's best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, the Company's intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nOverview\nNational Bankshares, Inc. is a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of Virginia. Located in southwest Virginia, NBI has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, the National Bank of Blacksburg and National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. The National Bank of Blacksburg ( NBB\u201d), which does business as National Bank from twenty-five office locations and one loan production office, is a community bank. NBB is the source of nearly all of the Company's revenue. National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. ( NBFS\u201d) does business as National Bankshares Investment Services and National Bankshares Insurance Services. Income from NBFS is not significant at this time, nor is it expected to be so in the near future.\nNational Bankshares, Inc. common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and is traded under the symbol NKSH.\u201d National Bankshares, Inc. has been included in the Russell Investments Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes since June 29, 2009.\nPerformance Summary\nThe following table presents NBI's key performance ratios for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.64 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.30 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic net earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fully diluted net earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.45 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.51 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest margin (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Net Interest Margin - Year-to-date tax equivalent net interest income divided by year-to-date average earning assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Noninterest Margin - Noninterest expense (excluding the provision for bad debts and income taxes) less noninterest income (excluding securities gains and losses) divided by average year-to-date assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.14%, a decrease from 1.24% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The return on average equity decreased from 8.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 7.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe net interest margin decreased from 3.51% at year-end 2016 to 3.45% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin benefitted from Federal Reserve interest rate increases, but reflected downward repricing of loans for competitive purposes, as well as the Company's asset liability management practices.\nThe noninterest margin decreased from 1.36% to 1.34% over the same period, while basic net earnings per common share decreased from $2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.03 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGrowth\nNBI's key growth indicators are shown in the following table:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>459,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, and the allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>660,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,256,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,233,942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal assets experienced growth in 2017, funded by increases in customer deposits. Customer deposits grew $16,292 or 1.56% from December 31, 2016, with increases mainly from municipal deposits and individuals seeking to safeguard principal by avoiding more volatile investments in financial markets. The liquidity provided by customer deposits supported growth in loans of $20,692 or 3.24%. Securities increased by $19,342 or 4.39%.\nIn both 2017 and 2016, the Company's growth was internally generated and was not the result of acquisitions or other borrowings.\nAsset Quality\nKey indicators of NBI's asset quality are presented in the following table:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,855 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to loans(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-off ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans in nonaccrual status.

At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were $2,769 or 0.41% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. This compares to $5,855 or 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at year-end 2017 totaled $51, a decrease of $12 or 19.05%, from $63 at December 31, 2016. The net charge-off ratio decreased from 0.26% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while other real estate owned decreased $339 for the same period.\nThe Company's risk analysis determined an allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, resulting in a provision for the year of $157. This compares with an allowance for loan losses of $8,300 as of December 31, 2016, and a provision of $1,650 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans decreased to 1.19%, from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses relies on historical charge-off trends, modified by trends in nonperforming loans and economic indicators. More information about the level and calculation methodology of the allowance for loan losses is provided in Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d, Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements,\u201d Balance Sheet - Loans - Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d as well as Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements.\nSufficient resources have been dedicated to working out problem assets, and exposure to loss is somewhat mitigated because most of the nonperforming loans are collateralized. More information about nonaccrual and past due loans is provided in Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements\u201d and Note 5 to the financial statements. The Company continues to monitor risk levels within the loan portfolio and expects that any further increase in the allowance for loan losses would be the result of the refinement of loss estimates and would not dramatically affect net income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $37,135, an increase of $371, or 1.01%, when compared to the prior year. The net interest margin for 2017 was 3.45%, compared to 3.51% for 2016. Total interest income for the period ended December 31, 2017 was $41,260, an increase of $330 from the period ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense declined by $41 during the same time frame, from $4,166 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4,125 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline in interest expense came about in part because higher priced certificates of deposit renewed at lower interest rates and because of the continued migration of time deposits to lower-cost non-time deposits. In addition, low-rate interest-bearing deposits volume increased substantially. Please refer to the section titled Analysis of Changes In Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d for further information related to rate and volume changes.\nThe amount of net interest income earned is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, U.S. fiscal policy, the level and composition of the earning assets and the composition of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company has the ability to respond over time to interest rate movements and reduce volatility in the net interest margin. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments by management.\nThe Federal Reserve increased its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016 and raised rates by 25 basis points again in March, June and December, 2017, ending the year at a target of 1.50%. The rate increases positively affected the yield on the Company's interest-bearing deposits in other banks for 2017. The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.52% for 2016 to 1.10% for 2017. However, the interest rate environment during 2017 is still considered to be relatively low by historical standards.\nThe primary source of funds used to support the Company's interest-earning assets is deposits. Deposits are obtained in the Company's trade area through traditional marketing techniques. Other funding sources, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, while available, are only used occasionally. The cost of funds is dependent on interest rate levels and competitive factors. This limits the ability of the Company to react to interest rate movements.\nFederal Reserve policies and market forces influence the Company's net interest margin. Because interest rates continue at relatively low levels, the Company expects that interest rates will likely increase in the future. The Company anticipates any rate increases will have a positive impact on the Company's future net interest income. Management cannot predict the timing and level of interest rate movements.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Earnings\nThe following table shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid, the average yield or rate on the daily average balance outstanding, net interest income and net yield on average interest-earning assets for

Total interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $190 while total interest expense declined by $41. Declining yields impacted net interest income by $1,177, offset by increases due to volume of $1,408.\nThe Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in December 2016 and three times in 2017. The rate increases had a direct and immediate effect on the Company's interest-bearing deposits. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits increased $460 due to rates, but declined by $201 due to reduced volume, for a net increase of $259 when 2017 is compared with 2016. The Company's securities and loan portfolios did not experience a similar increase in yields due to the longer-term nature of the portfolios, reinvestment opportunities in the bond market and the competitive lending environment of the Company's market area.\nTaxable equivalent interest income on loans increased $600 when 2017 and 2016 are compared. The average balance of loans increased from $622,239 in 2016 to $653,756 in 2017, increasing interest income by $1,491. Lower yields reduced interest income by $891.\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $199 when 2017 is compared with 2016, the result of an increase of $640 due to volume offset by a decline of $839 due to rates. Taxable-equivalent interest on non-taxable securities declined $36 due to rates and $434 due to volume. The low interest rate environment in 2016 resulted in a large number of called securities at a time when re-investment opportunities were less attractive than the yields on the original called securities. The lower yields available upon reinvestment of the call securities negatively impacted income from securities during 2017. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly.\nInterest on time deposits declined $170 from 2016 to 2017, with a decline of $74 due to rates and $96 due to decreased volume. See Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information related to the decline in interest expense.\nWhen 2016 is compared with 2015, taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $2,193. Total interest expense declined by $17, while interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased $2,210. Declining yields impacted net interest income by $2,862, offset by increases due to favorable changes in volume of $669.\nLower interest rates led to a decline of $1,214 in interest income from loans. The average balance of loans increased from $620,547 in 2015 to $622,239 in 2016, causing an increase in interest income of $85.\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $2,055 due to rates, offset by an increase of $1,189 due to average volume, for a net decrease of $866 compared to 2015. Interest on non-taxable securities on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined $11 due to rates and $482 due to volume. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly. Interest on time deposits declined $152 from 2015 to 2016, with a decline of $36 due to rates and $116 due to decreased volume.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe Company considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates. Among the tools available to management is interest rate sensitivity analysis, which provides information related to repricing opportunities. Interest rate shock simulations indicate potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes. Shock analysis is a test that measures the effect of a hypothetical, immediate and parallel shift in interest rates. The following table shows the results of a rate shock and the effects on the return on average assets and the return on average equity projected at December 31, 2017 and 2016. For purposes of this analysis, noninterest income and expenses are assumed to be flat.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> Rate Shift (bp)\n</td> <td> Return on Average Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Return on Average Equity\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 9.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 9.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 9.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 8.45\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (-)100\n</td> <td> 1.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 9.06\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (-)200\n</td> <td> 1.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.05\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (-)300\n</td> <td> 1.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 1.12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> 7.57\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSimulation analysis is another tool available to the Company to test asset and liability management strategies under rising and falling rate conditions. As a part of the simulation process, certain estimates and assumptions must be made. These include, but are not limited to, asset growth, the mix of assets and liabilities, rate environment and local and national economic conditions. Asset growth and the mix of assets can, to a degree, be influenced by management. Other areas, such as the rate environment and economic factors, cannot be controlled. In addition, competitive pressures can make it difficult to price deposits and loans in a manner that optimally minimizes interest rate risk. Therefore, actual results may vary materially from any particular forecast or shock analysis. This shortcoming is offset somewhat by the periodic reforecasting of the balance sheet to reflect current trends and economic conditions. Shock analysis must also be updated periodically as a part of the asset and liability management process.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other service charges and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit card fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized securities gains\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService charges on deposit accounts totaled $2,776 for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This income category is affected by the number of deposit accounts, the level of service charges and the number of checking account overdrafts. The 2017 increase resulted primarily from an increase of $325 in non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees due to implementation of a new overdraft privilege program during the second half of 2016. The 2016 increase resulted primarily from an increase of $224 in non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees due to implementation of the overdraft privilege program.\nOther service charges and fees include charges for official checks, income from the sale of checks to customers, safe deposit box rent, fees from letters of credit and income from commissions on the sale of credit life, accident and health insurance. These fees were $205 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $7, or 3.30%, from the $212 for 2016. The total for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3 below the $215 posted for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCredit card fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $150 above the $3,798 reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. From 2015 to 2016, credit card fees decreased $63, or 1.63%. Credit card fees are dependent on the volume of transactions.\nTrust fees at $1,530 increased by $184 or 13.67% when the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are compared. For the year ended December 31, 2016 trust fees were $1,346, an increase of $117, or 9.52%, from 2015. Trust fees are generated from a number of different types of accounts, including estates, personal trusts, employee benefit trusts, investment management accounts, attorney-in-fact accounts and guardianships. Trust income varies depending on the number and type of accounts under management and financial market conditions. The mix of account types also affected the level of trust fees in 2016 and 2017.\nNoninterest income from bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) increased, from $597 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $758 for 2017. The Company purchased an additional $10 million in BOLI in June 2017. BOLI income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $603. Income from bank-owned life insurance was affected by the performance of the variable rate policies, which has not varied significantly.\nOther income is income from smaller balance accounts that cannot be classified in another category. Some examples include gains on mortgage loans sold, net gains from the sale of fixed assets and revenue from investment and insurance sales. Other income for 2017 was $1,148, a decrease of $141, or 10.94%, when compared with $1,289 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In December 2017, the Company sold its Marion branch office and realized a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $134. This was offset by a decline of $69 in the gain on the sale of mortgage loans due to lower volume, and a decline of $230 due to a one-time vendor signing incentive received in 2016. Other income decreased slightly from 2015 to 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company sold a small investment in community bank stock that resulted in a gain of $4. All other realized gains and losses on securities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted from calls of securities. The Company did not sell any securities in 2016 or 2015.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,522 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy, furniture and fixtures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing and ATM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC assessment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit card processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangibles amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>999 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net costs of other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Franchise taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,635 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalary and benefits expense increased $954, or 7.46%, from $12,792 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $13,746 for 2017. Employee salaries increased $256 or 2.63% which was the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. Expense associated with the health insurance reserve increased $419. The Company participates in a self-funded\u201d insurance plan and reserves amounts based on employee health insurance usage and calculated projections. In 2016, the Company benefitted from refunds due to a change in the calculation of the required minimum reserve and from positive claims history. The Company began in 2017, a new incentive compensation program for senior employees, which contributed $280 to the increase. The increases were offset by a $101 decrease in salary expense related to deferred costs associated with loan production. Salary and benefits expense increased $270, or 2.16%, from $12,522 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12,792 for 2016. From 2015 to 2016, employee salaries increased $695 or 7.70%, which were the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. This was offset by a $680 reduction in fringe benefits and a reduction of $171 in BOLI and salary continuation expenses.\nOccupancy, furniture and fixtures expense was $1,820 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $29, or 1.57%, from the prior year. The decrease stemmed from higher expenditures on security equipment and building maintenance in the previous year. The 2016 total was $1,849, an increase of $106, or 6.08%, from the $1,743 reported at year-end 2015.\nData processing and ATM expense was $2,275 in 2017, $2,186 in 2016 and $1,657 in 2015. The increase of $89 or 4.07% from 2016 to 2017 was due to increased maintenance expense associated with infrastructure upgrades. The Company is committed to maintaining up-to-date technology in a cost-effective manner.\nWhen the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are compared, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment expense decreased $112 or 23.53%. The total expense for 2017 was $364, which compares with $476 for 2016. The FDIC assessment is accrued based on a method provided by the FDIC. The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reached a target threshold during the second quarter of 2016, resulting in lower FDIC insurance expense for many federally insured institutions. The FDIC assessment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $70 from $546 for 2015.\nCredit card processing expense was $2,748 for the period ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $34, or 1.22% from 2016's total of $2,782. Credit card processing expense in 2016 increased $90, or 3.34% from 2015. This expense is driven by the volume of credit card, debit card and merchant account transactions and by the level of merchant discount fees. It is subject to a degree of variability.\nThe expense for intangibles amortization is related to acquisitions. There were no acquisitions in the last year, and the expense for 2017 decreased from 2016 by $189 or 73.54%. The decrease in core deposit intangibles amortization is due to certain core deposit intangibles becoming fully amortized in late 2015, the first half of 2016, and the first quarter of 2017. The expense for intangibles amortization decreased $742 from 2015 to 2016.\nNet costs of other real estate owned decreased from $472 for the period ended December 31, 2016 to $205 for the year ended December 31, 2017. From 2015 to 2016, net costs of other real estate owned decreased $136 from $608. This expense category varies with the number of foreclosed properties owned by NBB and with the expense associated with each. It includes write-downs on other real estate owned plus other costs associated with carrying these properties, as well as net gains or losses on the sale of other real estate. In 2017, write-downs on other real estate were $113. This compares with $268 in 2016 and $440 in 2015. Other real estate is initially accounted for at fair value less estimated costs to sell using current valuations, which include appraisals, real estate evaluations and realtor market opinions. If new valuation information indicates a decline from the initial basis, the Company records a write-down. Other costs for these properties in 2017 were $80, compared with $118 in 2016. The Company recorded a loss of $12 on the sale of OREO in 2017 and a loss of $86 for 2016. The Company's market area is showing mixed economic signs, with some favorable indicators and some unfavorable indicators, and we anticipate that there may be additional foreclosures in the future. The Company currently does not have any loans in process of foreclosure.\nFranchise taxes were $1,315 for the period ended December 31, 2017 and $1,296 for 2016, an increase of $19 or 1.47%. Franchise tax expense increased $8 in 2016 from $1,288 in 2015. State bank franchise taxes are based upon NBB's total equity, which increased in both 2016 and 2017.\nThe category of other operating expenses includes noninterest expense items such as professional services, stationery and supplies, telephone costs and charitable donations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other operating expenses were $4,431. This compares with $4,042 for 2016 and $3,580 for 2015. The $389 increase from 2016 to 2017 was due to a loss of $189 resulting from a wire fraud and an increase in expenses associated with the overdraft program, legal fees, and audit and consulting services. The $462 increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of the recognition of $347 in bankcard losses.\nCybersecurity Risks and Incidents\nThe Company treats cybersecurity risk seriously. The Company has a program to identify, mitigate and manage its cybersecurity risks. The program includes penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, technological defenses such as antivirus software, patch management, and firewall management, as well as ongoing employee training. In 2017, the Company also implemented additional email and web protections, an intrusion prevention system and an additional targeted cybersecurity insurance policy. The costs of these measures were $134 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $66 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These costs are included in various categories of noninterest expense.\nThe Company experienced two intrusions to its digital systems, one in May 2016 and one in January 2017. Hackers and related organized criminal groups obtained unauthorized access to certain customer accounts. The attacks disabled certain systems protections, including limits on the number, amount, and frequency of ATM withdrawals. The attacks resulted in the theft of funds disbursed through ATMs. In the May 2016 attack, hackers accessed customer funds and in the January 2017 intrusion, the hackers artificially inflated account balances and did not access customer funds. The Company notified all affected customers, and restored all funds so that no customer experienced a loss.\nThe Company retained a nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the May 2016 intrusion and a separate nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the January 2017 intrusion. The firms provided the Company with recommendations concerning its systems and procedures. The Company adopted and implemented all of the recommendations resulting from the investigation of the May 2016 intrusion and has implemented most of the recommendations from the investigation of the January 2017 intrusion, with targeted completion for all such recommendations in 2018.\nThe financial impact of the attacks include the amount of the theft, as well as costs of investigation and remediation. The theft of funds totaled $570 in the May 2016 attack and $1,838 in the January 2017 attack. The Company recognized an estimated loss of $347 in 2016 within other operating expenses, and currently recognizes an insurance receivable in other assets of $2,061. The Company filed an insurance claim in 2017 for both of the breaches and is awaiting a response from the insurance company. The Company has had no adverse communication from the insurance company. Costs for investigation, remediation, and legal consultation totaled $407 in 2017 and $46 in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has appropriately accounted for the breaches. There has been no litigation to date associated with the breaches.\nWe have deployed a multi-faceted approach to limit the risk and impact of unauthorized access to customer accounts and to information relevant to customer accounts. We use digital technology safeguards, internal policies and procedures, and employee training to reduce the exposure of our systems to cyber-intrusions. However, it is not possible to fully eliminate exposure. The potential for financial and reputational losses due to cyber-breaches is increased by the possibility of human error, unknown system susceptibilities, and the rising sophistication of cyber-criminals to attack systems, disable safeguards and gain access to accounts and related information. The company has adopted new protections and invested additional resources to increase its security.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was $6,293 compared to $3,952 in 2016 and $4,740 in 2015. During the three years reported, the Company's marginal tax rate was 35%. The Company's effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 30.87%, 20.92% and 23.04%, respectively. The expected income tax expense based on the Company's marginal tax rate differs from the actual income tax expense due to tax exempt income on municipal securities and loans as well as the re-valuation of deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) was enacted and is effective January 1, 2018. The Act will reduce the Company's tax rate to 21%. As a result of the change in the Company's future tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) require revaluation in 2017 of deferred tax assets to the rate at which they will be realized. During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a revaluation adjustment of $1.56 million, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for addition information relating to income taxes.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income generally reflect the effects of inflation. Since interest rates, loan demand and deposit levels are related to inflation, the resulting changes are included in net income. The most significant item which does not reflect the effects of inflation is depreciation expense. Historical dollar values used to determine depreciation expense do not reflect the effects of inflation on the market value of depreciable assets after their acquisition.\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company's risk analysis at December 31, 2017 determined an allowance for loan losses of $7,925 or 1.19% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, a decrease from $8,300 or 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses resulted in a provision for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. To determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, the Company considers credit risk for certain loans designated as impaired and for non-impaired ( collectively evaluated\u201d) loans.\nIndividually evaluated impaired loans totaled $11,924 on a gross basis and $11,919 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $177 at December 31, 2017. Individually evaluated impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were $9,173 on a gross basis and $9,168 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $26. The specific allocation is determined based on criteria particular to each impaired loan.\nCollectively evaluated loans totaled $656,758 on a gross basis and $656,150 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, collectively evaluated loans totaled $639,373 on a gross basis and $638,584 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $8,274 or 1.30%.\nFor collectively evaluated loans, the Company applies to each loan class a historical net charge-off rate, adjusted for qualitative factors that influence credit risk. Qualitative factors evaluated for impact to credit risk include economic measures, asset quality indicators, loan characteristics, and internal Bank policies and management.\nNet charge-off rates for each class are averaged over 8 quarters (2 years) to determine the historical net charge off rate applied to each class of collectively evaluated loans. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $532 or 0.08% of average loans, an improvement from $1,647 or 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $1,975 or 0.32% of loans. Increases in the net charge-off rate increase the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while decreases in the net charge-off rate decrease the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans.\nEconomic factors influence credit risk and impact the allowance for loan loss. The Company considers economic indicators that impact its markets, including: unemployment, personal bankruptcy filings, business bankruptcy filings, the interest rate environment, residential vacancy rates, housing inventory for sale, and the competitive environment. Lower unemployment lowers credit risk and the necessary allowance for loan losses, while higher unemployment increases credit risk. Higher bankruptcy filings indicate heightened credit risk and increase the allowance for loan losses, while lower bankruptcy filings have a beneficial impact on credit risk. The interest rate environment impacts variable rate loans. As interest rates increase, the payment on variable rate loans increases, increasing credit risk. Residential vacancy rates and housing inventory for sale impact the Company's residential construction customers and the consumer real estate market. Higher levels increase credit risk. Higher competition for loans increases credit risk, while lower competition decreases credit risk.\nEconomic indicators that improved from December 31, 2016 were lower unemployment, lower personal bankruptcies and lower housing inventory for sale in the Company's market area. Improved economic indicators result in a lower requirement for the allowance for loan losses. Economic indicators that negatively impacted credit risk included elevated business bankruptcies and increases in the interest rate environment, when data at December 31, 2017 are compared with data at December 31, 2016. Residential vacancy rates resulted in a slightly larger allowance, and the competitive environment remained at a similar level to that at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company considers other factors that impact credit risk, including the legal and regulatory environments, changes to lending policies and loan review, and management's experience. Each of the factors remained at similar levels to December 31, 2016.\nAsset quality indicators affect the level of the allowance for loan losses. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days were 0.34% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, a decrease from 0.39% at December 31, 2016. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were 0.01% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, the same level as December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans decreased to 0.41% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, from 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Decreases in past due and nonaccrual loans reduce the required level of the allowance for loan losses, while increases in past due and nonaccrual loans increase the required level of the allowance for loan losses.\nLoans rated special mention\u201d and classified\u201d (together, criticized assets\u201d) indicate heightened credit risk. Higher levels of criticized assets increase the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while lower levels of criticized assets reduce the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans. Loans rated special mention receive a 50% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors, and loans rated classified receive a 100% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors. A classified loss rate is also applied to classified loans, calculated as net charge offs divided by classified loans.\nCollectively evaluated loans rated special mention\u201d were $3,361 at December 31, 2017, down from $13,519 at December 31, 2016. Collectively evaluated loans rated classified were $1,691 at December 31, 2017, down from $3,052 at December 31, 2016.\nLevels of high risk loans are considered in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan loss. High risk loans are defined by the Company as loans secured by junior liens, interest-only loans and loans with a high loan-to-value ratio. A decrease in the level of high risk loans within a class decreases the required allocation for the loan class, and an increase in the level of high risk loans within a class increases the required allocation for the loan class. Total high risk loans fell by $6,081 or 3.76% from the level at December 31, 2016, resulting in a decreased allocation.\nThe calculation of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses incorporates analysis of multiple factors and requires management's prudent and informed judgment. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017 is 1.19%, a decrease from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loan losses to collectively-evaluated loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs was 1.18%, compared with 1.30% at December 31, 2016. Improvements from December 31, 2016 in the charge-off rate, nonaccrual loans, criticized loans, unemployment, personal bankruptcies and housing inventory decreased the required level of the allowance for loan losses, slightly offset by worsening in business bankruptcies, residential vacancy and the impact of the interest rate environment. Based on analysis of historical indicators, asset quality and economic factors, management believes the level of allowance for loan losses is reasonable for the credit risk in the loan portfolio.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 43: <table> <tr>

accruing loans 90 days or more past due or accruing restructured loans. Troubled debt restructurings are discussed in detail under the section titled D. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR Loans)\u201d below. Impaired loans, or loans for which management does not expect to collect at the original loan terms, but which may or may not be nonperforming, are presented in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal impaired loans at December 31, 2017 were $11,924, of which $2,763 were in nonaccrual status. Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,173 and $15,346, of which $5,404 and $6,532 were in nonaccrual status, respectively.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans improved from 141.76% in 2016 to 286.20% in 2017. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate for the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nD. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs\u201d)\nIn the ordinary course of business the Company modifies loan terms on a case-by-case basis, including both consumer and commercial loans, for a variety of reasons. Modifications to consumer loans generally involve short-term deferrals to accommodate specific, temporary circumstances. The Company may grant extensions to borrowers who have demonstrated a willingness and ability to repay their loan but who are experiencing consequences of a specific unforeseen temporary hardship.\nAn extension defers monthly payments and requires a balloon payment at the original contractual maturity. If the temporary event is not expected to impact a borrower's ability to repay the debt, and if the Company expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay at contractual maturity, the modification is not designated a TDR.\nModifications to commercial loans may include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rate, maturity, amortization and financial covenants. In the original underwriting, loan terms are established that represent the then-current and projected financial condition of the borrower. If the modified terms are consistent with competitive market conditions and representative of terms the borrower could otherwise obtain in the open market, the modified loan is not categorized as a TDR.\nThe Company codes modifications to assist in identifying troubled debt restructurings. The majority of modifications were granted for competitive reasons and did not constitute troubled debt restructurings.

the original contractual loan terms are designated troubled debt restructurings.\nModifications of loan terms to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are made in an attempt to protect as much of the Company's investment in the loan as possible. The determination of whether a modification should be accounted for as a TDR requires significant judgment after consideration of all facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.\nAssuming all other TDR criteria are met, the Company considers one or a combination of the following concessions to the loan terms to indicate TDR status: a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with a similar term and similar risk, or forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.\nThe Company has restructured loan terms for certain qualified financially distressed borrowers who have agreed to work in good faith and have demonstrated the ability to make the restructured payments in order to avoid a foreclosure. All TDR loans are individually evaluated for impairment for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses. TDR loans with an impairment loss or that do not demonstrate current payments for at least six months are maintained on nonaccrual until the borrower demonstrates sustained repayment history under the restructured terms and continued repayment is not in doubt. Otherwise, interest income is recognized using a cost recovery method.\nThe Company had $7,897 in TDRs as of December 31, 2017 and $8,456 as of December 31, 2016. Accruing TDR loans amounted to $5,134 at December 31, 2017 compared to $3,769 at December 31, 2016.\nRestructuring generally results in loans with either lower payments or an extended maturity beyond that originally required, and are expected to have a lower risk of loss due to nonperformance than loans classified as nonperforming. In 2017, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $1,387 and that have total principal balances of $1,369 as of December 31, 2017. Some of the Company's restructured loans defaulted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company defines default as a delay in one payment of more than 90 days or foreclosure after the date of restructuring. All of the restructured loans that defaulted had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\nIn 2016, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $3,042 and that had total principal balances of $2,761 as of December 31, 2016. All of the restructured loans that defaulted in 2016 had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\nPlease refer to Note 5 for information on the effect of default on the allowance for loan losses.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> TDR Delinquency Status as of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total TDR\nLoans\n</td> <td>

When delinquency status or other information indicates that the borrower will not repay the loan, the Company considers collateral value based upon a current appraisal or internal evaluation. Any loan amount in excess of collateral value is charged off and the collateral is taken into other real estate owned.\nManagement analyzes many factors to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and resultant provision expense, including the historical loss rate, the quality of the loan portfolio as determined by management, diversification as to type of loans in the portfolio, internal policies and economic factors. Management considers net charge-offs over the most recent eight quarters to determine the historical loss rate to be applied to the calculation. The historical loss rate contributes significantly to the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nB.

Valuation procedures for impaired loans resulted in a required reserve for impaired loans of $177 at December 31, 2017, $26 at December 31, 2016 and $45 at December 31, 2015. The amount of the individual impaired loan balance that exceeds the fair value is accrued in the allowance for loan losses.\nManagement's analysis of the loan portfolio and pertinent economic conditions resulted in a determination of the allowance for loan losses for collectively-evaluated loans of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017, $8,275 or 1.30% at December 31, 2016, and $8,252 or 1.37% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for collectively-evaluated loans is determined by applying historical charge-off percentages, as well as additional accruals for internal and external credit risk factors to groups of collectively-evaluated loans. The ratio decreased from 2016 to 2017 due to a decreased charge-off ratio, down from 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also contributing to the reduced allowance requirement were improved asset quality indicators, lower levels of high risk loans and favorable economic indicators. The ratio decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to decreases in net charge-offs. When compared with 2015, the level of the allowance for loan losses for 2016 also benefitted from improvements in asset quality, high risk loans and economic indicators.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve was $319 at December 31, 2017, $257 at December 31, 2016 and $28 at December 31, 2015. The unallocated portion of the reserve is the amount that exceeds the calculated requirement for the allowance for loan losses. The Company's policy permits an unallocated reserve of up to 5% in excess of the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe total calculated allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, $8,300 as of December 31, 2016 and $8,297 as of December 31, 2015 indicated provision charges for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and $2,009 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to the discussion under Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information on the determination of the allowance for loan loss.\nSecurities\nThe fair value of securities available for sale was $331,387, an increase of $27,105 or 8.91% from December 31, 2016. The amortized cost of securities held to maturity was $127,164 at December 31, 2017 and $134,957 at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $7,793 or 5.77%.\nAdditional information about securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can be found in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe securities portfolio is subject to the volatility and risk in the financial markets. The risk in financial markets affects the Company in the same way that it affects other institutional and individual investors. The Company's investment portfolio includes corporate bonds. If, because of economic hardship, the corporate issuers were to default, there could be a delay in the payment of interest, or there could be a loss of principal and accrued interest. To date, there have been no defaults in any of the corporate bonds held in the portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio also contains a large percentage of municipal bonds. If economic forces reduce the ability of states and municipalities to make scheduled principal and interest payments on their outstanding indebtedness, or if their income from taxes and other sources declines significantly, states and municipalities could default on their bond obligations. There have been no defaults among the municipal bonds in the Company's investment portfolio. The fair value of our bond portfolio is affected by interest rates. The fair value of available for sale securities is reflected on the Company's balance sheet, while held to maturity securities are reported at amortized cost.\nIn making investment decisions, management follows internal policy guidelines that help to limit risk by specifying parameters for both security quality and industry and geographic concentrations. Management regularly monitors the quality of the investment portfolio and tracks changes in financial markets. The value of individual securities will be written down if a decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary, given the totality of the circumstances.\nMaturities and Associated

obligations held at December 31, 2017 were backed by U.S. agencies. Certain holdings are required to be periodically subjected to the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council's (FFIEC) high risk mortgage security test. These tests address possible fluctuations in the average life and variances caused by the change in rate times the change in volume that have been allocated to rate and volume changes proportional to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Except for U.S. Government securities, the Company has no securities with any issuer that exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased by $16,292 or 1.56%, from $1,043,442 at December 31, 2016 to $1,059,734 at December 31, 2017. Total deposits grew $24,583, or 2.41%, from $1,018,859 at December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. A portion of the increase in both 2017 and 2016 is attributable to a higher level of municipal deposits. The increases in total deposits for 2017 and 2016 were internally generated and not the result of acquisitions.\nA.

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and recourse obligations in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 14, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Management does not plan any future involvement in high risk derivative products. The Company has investments in mortgage-backed securities, principally GNMA's and FNMA's, with a fair value of approximately $889. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to securities.\nThe Company's securities and loans are subject to credit and interest rate risk, and its deposits are subject to interest rate risk. Management considers credit risk when a loan is granted and monitors credit risk after the loan is granted. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses in the collection of its loans. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to the allowance for loan losses. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has an asset/liability program to manage its interest rate risk. This program provides management with information related to the rate sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the effect of changing rates on profitability and capital accounts.\nThe effects of changing interest rates are primarily managed through adjustments to the loan portfolio and deposit base, to the extent competitive factors allow. The investment portfolio is generally longer term. Adjustments for asset and liability management are made when securities are called or mature and funds are subsequently reinvested. Securities may be sold for reasons related to credit quality or regulatory limitations, and in limited circumstances, securities available for sale have been disposed of for interest rate risk management. No trading activity for this purpose is planned in the foreseeable future, though it does remain an option.\nWhile the asset/liability planning program is designed to protect the Company over the long term, it does not provide near-term protection from interest rate shocks, as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not by their nature move up or down in tandem in response to changes in the overall rate environment. The Company's profitability in the near term may be temporarily negatively affected in a period of rapidly rising or rapidly falling rates, because it takes some time for the Company to change its rates to adjust to a new interest rate environment. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to fair value of financial instruments and comments concerning interest rate sensitivity.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures the Company's ability to meet its financial commitments at a reasonable cost. Demands on the Company's liquidity include funding additional loan demand and accepting withdrawals of existing deposits. The Company has diverse liquidity sources, including customer and purchased deposits, customer repayments of loan principal and interest, sales, calls and maturities of securities, Federal Reserve discount window borrowing, short-term borrowing, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. At December 31, 2017, the bank did not have discount window borrowings, short-term borrowings, or FHLB advances. To assure that short-term borrowing is readily available, the Company tests accessibility annually.\nLiquidity from securities is restricted by accounting and business considerations. The securities portfolio is segregated into available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. The Company considers only securities designated available-for-sale for typical liquidity needs. Further, portions of the securities portfolio are pledged to meet state requirements for public funds deposits. Discount window borrowings also require pledged securities. Increased/decreased liquidity from public funds deposits or discount window borrowings results in increased/decreased liquidity from pledging requirements. The Company monitors public funds pledging requirements and unpledged available-for-sale securities accessible for liquidity needs.\nRegulatory capital levels determine the Company's ability to use purchased deposits and the Federal Reserve discount window. At December 31, 2017, the Company is considered well capitalized and does not have any restrictions on purchased deposits or borrowing ability at the Federal Reserve discount window.\nThe Company monitors factors that may increase its liquidity needs. Some of these factors include deposit trends, large depositor activity, maturing deposit promotions, interest rate sensitivity, maturity and repricing timing gaps between assets and liabilities, the level of unfunded loan commitments and loan growth. At December 31, 2017, the Company's liquidity is sufficient to meet projected trends in these areas.\nTo monitor and estimate liquidity levels, the Company performs stress testing under varying assumptions on credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and amounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows. The Company's Contingency Funding Plan sets forth avenues for rectifying liquidity shortfalls. At December 31, 2017, the analysis indicated adequate liquidity under the tested scenarios.\nThe Company utilizes several other strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity. Loan and deposit growth are managed to keep the loan to deposit ratio within the Company's own policy range of 65% to 75%.

Amounts drawn upon these lines vary at any given time depending on the business needs of the customers.\nStandby letters of credit are also issued to the bank's customers. There are two types of standby letters of credit. The first is a guarantee of payment to facilitate customer purchases. The second type is a performance letter of credit that guarantees a payment if the customer fails to perform a specific obligation. Revenue from these letters was approximately $57 in 2017.\nWhile it would be possible for customers to fully draw on approved lines of credit and for beneficiaries to call all letters of credit, historically this has not occurred. In the event of a sudden and substantial draw on these lines, the Company has its own lines of credit from which it can draw funds. A sale of loans or investments would also be an option.\nThe Company sells mortgages on the secondary market subject to recourse agreements.

Impaired loans are larger non-homogeneous loans for which there is a probability that collection will not occur according to the loan terms, as well as loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Impaired loans that are not TDR's with an estimated impairment loss are placed on nonaccrual status. TDR's with an impairment loss may accrue interest if they have demonstrated six months of timely payment performance.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance related to impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance to impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.48 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>604,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance related to non-impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,252 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance to non-impaired loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.29 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>668,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>648,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619,884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: unearned income and deferred fees and costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(613 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(794 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(876 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>668,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619,008 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses, total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance as a percentage of loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, the Company sold a small investment in community bank stock that resulted in a gain of $4.

collateral-dependent loan for which recovery is expected solely from the sale of collateral is reduced by estimated selling costs. Estimated losses on collateral-dependent loans, as well as any other impairment loss considered uncollectible, are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Impairment losses that are not considered uncollectible or for loans that are not collateral dependent are accrued in the allowance. Impaired loans with partial charge-offs are maintained as impaired until the remaining balance is satisfied. Smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and are not part of a larger impaired relationship are collectively evaluated.\nNoninterest income from bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) increased, from $597 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $758 for 2017.

There were no acquisitions in the last year, and the expense for 2017 decreased from 2016 by $189 or 73.54%. The decrease in core deposit intangibles amortization is due to certain core deposit intangibles becoming fully amortized in late 2015, the first half of 2016, and the first quarter of 2017. The expense for intangibles amortization decreased $742 from 2015 to 2016.\nTotal assets experienced growth in 2017, funded by increases in customer deposits. Customer deposits grew $16,292 or 1.56% from December 31, 2016, with increases mainly from municipal deposits and individuals seeking to safeguard principal by avoiding more volatile investments in financial markets. The liquidity provided by customer deposits supported growth in loans of $20,692 or 3.24%. Securities increased by $19,342 or 4.39%.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Goodwill is held by the Company's bank subsidiary. The bank subsidiary is 100% owned by the Company, and no market capitalization is available. Because most of the Company's assets are comprised of the subsidiary bank's equity, the Company's market capitalization was used to estimate the Bank's market capitalization. Other judgments include the assumption that the companies and transactions used as comparables for the second and third technique were appropriate to the estimate of the Company's fair value, and that the comparable multiples are appropriate indicators of fair value, and compliant with accounting guidance.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.64 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.30 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic net earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fully diluted net earnings per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.45 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.51 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest margin (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe financial impact of the attacks include the amount of the theft, as well as costs of investigation and remediation.

For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) the Company intends to sell the security or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, the Company must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. The Company regularly reviews each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, the Company's best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, the Company's intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ratios at\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory Capital Minimum Ratios\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory Capital Minimum Ratios with Capital Conservation Buffer\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier I Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.562 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.500 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.750 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier I Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.562 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.000 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.250 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.542 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.000 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.250 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.424 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.000 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.000 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollectively evaluated loans totaled $656,758 on a gross basis and $656,150 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, collectively evaluated loans totaled $639,373 on a gross basis and $638,584 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $8,274 or 1.30%.\nThe primary source of funds used to support the Company's interest-earning assets is deposits. Deposits are obtained in the Company's trade area through traditional marketing techniques. Other funding sources, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, while available, are only used occasionally. The cost of funds is dependent on interest rate levels and competitive factors. This limits the ability of the Company to react to interest rate movements.\nThe Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in December 2016 and three times in 2017. The rate increases had a direct and immediate effect on the Company's interest-bearing deposits. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits increased $460 due to rates, but declined by $201 due to reduced volume, for a net increase of $259 when 2017 is compared with 2016. The Company's securities and loan portfolios did not experience a similar increase in yields due to the longer-term nature of the portfolios, reinvestment opportunities in the bond market and the competitive lending environment of the Company's market area.\nNet costs of other real estate owned decreased from $472 for the period ended December 31, 2016 to $205 for the year ended December 31, 2017. From 2015 to 2016, net costs of other real estate owned decreased $136 from $608. This expense category varies with the number of foreclosed properties owned by NBB and with the expense associated with each. It includes write-downs on other real estate owned plus other costs associated with carrying these properties, as well as net gains or losses on the sale of other real estate. In 2017, write-downs on other real estate were $113. This compares with $268 in 2016 and $440 in 2015. Other real estate is initially accounted for at fair value less estimated costs to sell using current valuations, which include appraisals, real estate evaluations and realtor market opinions. If new valuation information indicates a decline from the initial basis, the Company records a write-down. Other costs for these properties in 2017 were $80, compared with $118 in 2016. The Company recorded a loss of $12 on the sale of OREO in 2017 and a loss of $86 for 2016. The Company's market area is showing mixed economic signs, with some favorable indicators and some unfavorable indicators, and we anticipate that there may be additional foreclosures in the future. The Company currently does not have any loans in process of foreclosure.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>459,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, and the allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>660,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,256,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,233,942 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's loan categorization reflects its approach to loan portfolio management and includes six groups. Real estate construction loans include construction loans for residential and commercial properties, as well as land. Consumer real estate loans include conventional and junior lien mortgages, equity lines and investor-owned residential real estate. Commercial real estate loans are comprised of owner-occupied and leased nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multi-family residence loans and farmland. Commercial non real estate loans include agricultural loans, operating capital lines and loans secured by capital assets. Public sector and IDA loans are extended to municipalities. Consumer non real estate loans include automobile loans, personal loans, credit cards and consumer overdrafts.\nThe estimation of the allowance involves analysis of internal and external variables, methodologies, assumptions and our judgment and experience. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for loan losses include internal risk rating determinations, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions. These judgments are inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimate. Future estimates of the allowance could increase or decrease based on changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, concentrations of various types of loans, economic conditions or the markets in which collateral may be sold. The estimate of the allowance accrual determines the amount of provision expense and directly affects our financial results.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,855 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to loans(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-off ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn extension defers monthly payments and requires a balloon payment at the original contractual maturity.

In 2017, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $1,387 and that have total principal balances of $1,369 as of December 31, 2017. Some of the Company's restructured loans defaulted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company defines default as a delay in one payment of more than 90 days or foreclosure after the date of restructuring. All of the restructured loans that defaulted had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Statement Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,981 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,492 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Per Share Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fully diluted net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash dividends per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>--- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>--- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe Company considers other factors that impact credit risk, including the legal and regulatory environments, changes to lending policies and loan review, and management's experience.

The risk in financial markets affects the Company in the same way that it affects other institutional and individual investors. The Company's investment portfolio includes corporate bonds. If, because of economic hardship, the corporate issuers were to default, there could be a delay in the payment of interest, or there could be a loss of principal and accrued interest. To date, there have been no defaults in any of the corporate bonds held in the portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio also contains a large percentage of municipal bonds. If economic forces reduce the ability of states and municipalities to make scheduled principal and interest payments on their outstanding indebtedness, or if their income from taxes and other sources declines significantly, states and municipalities could default on their bond obligations. There have been no defaults among the municipal bonds in the Company's investment portfolio. The fair value of our bond portfolio is affected by interest rates.

TDR loans with an impairment loss or that do not demonstrate current payments for at least six months are maintained on nonaccrual until the borrower demonstrates sustained repayment history under the restructured terms and continued repayment is not in doubt. Otherwise, interest income is recognized using a cost recovery method.\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to recent accounting pronouncements.\nService charges on deposit accounts totaled $2,776 for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This income category is affected by the number of deposit accounts, the level of service charges and the number of checking account overdrafts. The 2017 increase resulted primarily from an increase of $325 in non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees due to implementation of a new overdraft privilege program during the second half of 2016.

The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses resulted in a provision for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.

The Company's profitability in the near term may be temporarily negatively affected in a period of rapidly rising or rapidly falling rates, because it takes some time for the Company to change its rates to adjust to a new interest rate environment.

Accruing TDR loans amounted to $5,134 at December 31, 2017 compared to $3,769 at December 31, 2016.\nOther Than Temporary Impairment of Securities ( OTTI\u201d)\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n \u25cf monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the impact of any policies or programs implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and other financial reform legislation, \nNoninterest Income\nSufficient resources have been dedicated to working out problem assets, and exposure to loss is somewhat mitigated because most of the nonperforming loans are collateralized. More information about nonaccrual and past due loans is provided in Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements\u201d and Note 5 to the financial statements. The Company continues to monitor risk levels within the loan portfolio and expects that any further increase in the allowance for loan losses would be the result of the refinement of loss estimates and would not dramatically affect net income.\n\nThe Company monitors asset quality indicators in managing credit risk and in determining the allowance and provision for loan losses. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were $2,769 or 0.41% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. This compares to $5,855 or 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at year-end 2017 totaled $51, a decrease of $12 or 19.05%, from $63 at December 31, 2016. The net charge-off ratio decreased from 0.26% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while other real estate owned decreased $339 for the same period.\nLoan loss and other indicators related to asset quality are presented in the Loan Loss Data table.\n \u25cf unanticipated increases in the level of unemployment in the Company's trade area, \nSalary and benefits expense increased $954, or 7.46%, from $12,792 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $13,746 for 2017. Employee salaries increased $256 or 2.63% which was the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. Expense associated with the health insurance reserve increased $419. The Company participates in a self-funded\u201d insurance plan and reserves amounts based on employee health insurance usage and calculated projections. In 2016, the Company benefitted from refunds due to a change in the calculation of the required minimum reserve and from positive claims history. The Company began in 2017, a new incentive compensation program for senior employees, which contributed $280 to the increase. The increases were offset by a $101 decrease in salary expense related to deferred costs associated with loan production. Salary and benefits expense increased $270, or 2.16%, from $12,522 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12,792 for 2016. From 2015 to 2016, employee salaries increased $695 or 7.70%, which were the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. This was offset by a $680 reduction in fringe benefits and a reduction of $171 in BOLI and salary continuation expenses.\nWhile it would be possible for customers to fully draw on approved lines of credit and for beneficiaries to call all letters of credit, historically this has not occurred. In the event of a sudden and substantial draw on these lines, the Company has its own lines of credit from which it can draw funds. A sale of loans or investments would also be an option.\nImpaired loans are identified through the Company's credit risk rating process. Estimated loss for an impaired loan is the amount of recorded investment that exceeds the loan's fair value. Fair value of an impaired loan is measured by one of three methods: the fair value of collateral ( collateral method\u201d), the present value of future cash flows ( cash flow method\u201d), or observable market price. The Company applies the collateral method to collateral-dependent loans, loans for which foreclosure is imminent and to loans for which the fair value of collateral is a more reliable estimate of fair value. The cash flow method is applied to loans that are not collateral dependent and for which cash flows may be estimated.\nThe following table presents the maturities for securities available for sale and held to maturity at their carrying values as of December 31, 2017 and weighted average yield for each range of maturities.\n\nLoan Loss Data Table\n (2) Loan fees of $303 in 2017, $360 in 2016 and $448 in 2015 are included in total interest income. \nWhen the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are compared, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment expense decreased $112 or 23.53%. The total expense for 2017 was $364, which compares with $476 for 2016. The FDIC assessment is accrued based on a method provided by the FDIC. The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reached a target threshold during the second quarter of 2016, resulting in lower FDIC insurance expense for many federally insured institutions. The FDIC assessment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $70 from $546 for 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAssuming all other TDR criteria are met, the Company considers one or a combination of the following concessions to the loan terms to indicate TDR status: a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with a similar term and similar risk, or forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income generally reflect the effects of inflation. Since interest rates, loan demand and deposit levels are related to inflation, the resulting changes are included in net income. The most significant item which does not reflect the effects of inflation is depreciation expense. Historical dollar values used to determine depreciation expense do not reflect the effects of inflation on the market value of depreciable assets after their acquisition.\nData processing and ATM expense was $2,275 in 2017, $2,186 in 2016 and $1,657 in 2015. The increase of $89 or 4.07% from 2016 to 2017 was due to increased maintenance expense associated with infrastructure upgrades. The Company is committed to maintaining up-to-date technology in a cost-effective manner.\nBalance Sheet\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to an additional capital conservation buffer in order to make capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. The implementation period for the capital conservation buffer began in 2016 and will be fully phased in January 1, 2019, with .625% added each year and a final buffer of 2.5% in excess of regulatory capital minimum ratios.\nIn the normal course of business the Company's banking affiliate extends lines of credit to its customers. Amounts drawn upon these lines vary at any given time depending on the business needs of the customers.\n (1) Net Interest Margin - Year-to-date tax equivalent net interest income divided by year-to-date average earning assets. \nLower interest rates led to a decline of $1,214 in interest income from loans. The average balance of loans increased from $620,547 in 2015 to $622,239 in 2016, causing an increase in interest income of $85.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans improved from 141.76% in 2016 to 286.20% in 2017. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate for the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\n \u25cf competition, \nB. Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nImpaired loans\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $37,135, an increase of $371, or 1.01%, when compared to the prior year. The net interest margin for 2017 was 3.45%, compared to 3.51% for 2016. Total interest income for the period ended December 31, 2017 was $41,260, an increase of $330 from the period ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense declined by $41 during the same time frame, from $4,166 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4,125 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline in interest expense came about in part because higher priced certificates of deposit renewed at lower interest rates and because of the continued migration of time deposits to lower-cost non-time deposits. In addition, low-rate interest-bearing deposits volume increased substantially. Please refer to the section titled Analysis of Changes In Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d for further information related to rate and volume changes.\n \u25cf applicable accounting principles, policies and guidelines. \nAnalysis of Net Interest Earnings\nFranchise taxes were $1,315 for the period ended December 31, 2017 and $1,296 for 2016, an increase of $19 or 1.47%. Franchise tax expense increased $8 in 2016 from $1,288 in 2015. State bank franchise taxes are based upon NBB's total equity, which increased in both 2016 and 2017.\nUpdated appraisals or evaluations are ordered when the loan becomes impaired if the appraisal or evaluation on file is more than twelve months old. Appraisals and evaluations are reviewed for propriety and reasonableness and may be discounted if the Company determines that the value exceeds reasonable levels. If an updated appraisal or evaluation has been ordered but has not been received by a reporting date, the fair value may be based on the most recent available appraisal or evaluation, discounted for age.\n (1) Loans are presented on a gross basis. \nEconomic indicators that improved from December 31, 2016 were lower unemployment, lower personal bankruptcies and lower housing inventory for sale in the Company's market area. Improved economic indicators result in a lower requirement for the allowance for loan losses. Economic indicators that negatively impacted credit risk included elevated business bankruptcies and increases in the interest rate environment, when data at December 31, 2017 are compared with data at December 31, 2016. Residential vacancy rates resulted in a slightly larger allowance, and the competitive environment remained at a similar level to that at December 31, 2016.\nEconomic factors influence credit risk and impact the allowance for loan loss. The Company considers economic indicators that impact its markets, including: unemployment, personal bankruptcy filings, business bankruptcy filings, the interest rate environment, residential vacancy rates, housing inventory for sale, and the competitive environment. Lower unemployment lowers credit risk and the necessary allowance for loan losses, while higher unemployment increases credit risk. Higher bankruptcy filings indicate heightened credit risk and increase the allowance for loan losses, while lower bankruptcy filings have a beneficial impact on credit risk. The interest rate environment impacts variable rate loans. As interest rates increase, the payment on variable rate loans increases, increasing credit risk. Residential vacancy rates and housing inventory for sale impact the Company's residential construction customers and the consumer real estate market. Higher levels increase credit risk. Higher competition for loans increases credit risk, while lower competition decreases credit risk.\nGoodwill\nRisk based capital ratios are shown in the following tables.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance is funded by the provision for loan losses, reduced by charge-offs of loans and increased by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. The determination of the allowance is based on two accounting principles, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450-20 (Contingencies) which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, and ASC Topic 310-10 (Receivables) which requires accrual of losses on impaired loans if the recorded investment exceeds fair value.\nLiquidity\nCollectively-evaluated loans\nThe return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.14%, a decrease from 1.24% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The return on average equity decreased from 8.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 7.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoans rated special mention\u201d and classified\u201d (together, criticized assets\u201d) indicate heightened credit risk. Higher levels of criticized assets increase the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while lower levels of criticized assets reduce the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans. Loans rated special mention receive a 50% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors, and loans rated classified receive a 100% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors. A classified loss rate is also applied to classified loans, calculated as net charge offs divided by classified loans.\n (5) Daily averages are shown at amortized cost. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n (1) Taxable equivalent basis using a Federal income tax rate of 35% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. (2) Variances caused by the change in rate times the change in volume have been allocated to rate and volume changes proportional to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n \u25cf the quality or composition of the loan and/or investment portfolios, \nTotal deposits increased by $16,292 or 1.56%, from $1,043,442 at December 31, 2016 to $1,059,734 at December 31, 2017. Total deposits grew $24,583, or 2.41%, from $1,018,859 at December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. A portion of the increase in both 2017 and 2016 is attributable to a higher level of municipal deposits. The increases in total deposits for 2017 and 2016 were internally generated and not the result of acquisitions.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was $6,293 compared to $3,952 in 2016 and $4,740 in 2015. During the three years reported, the Company's marginal tax rate was 35%. The Company's effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 30.87%, 20.92% and 23.04%, respectively. The expected income tax expense based on the Company's marginal tax rate differs from the actual income tax expense due to tax exempt income on municipal securities and loans as well as the re-valuation of deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) was enacted and is effective January 1, 2018. The Act will reduce the Company's tax rate to 21%. As a result of the change in the Company's future tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) require revaluation in 2017 of deferred tax assets to the rate at which they will be realized. During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a revaluation adjustment of $1.56 million, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for addition information relating to income taxes.\nThe Company's off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017 are detailed in the table below.\n \u25cf deposit flows, \nDerivatives and Market Risk Exposures\nSecurities\nCapital Resources\n\nA. Average Amounts of Deposits and Average Rates Paid\nThe category of other operating expenses includes noninterest expense items such as professional services, stationery and supplies, telephone costs and charitable donations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other operating expenses were $4,431. This compares with $4,042 for 2016 and $3,580 for 2015. The $389 increase from 2016 to 2017 was due to a loss of $189 resulting from a wire fraud and an increase in expenses associated with the overdraft program, legal fees, and audit and consulting services. The $462 increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of the recognition of $347 in bankcard losses.\nGoodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. The Company performs impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company's most recent impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accounting guidance provides the option of performing preliminary assessment of qualitative factors before performing more substantial testing for impairment. The Company opted not to perform the preliminary assessment. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis considered three valuation techniques appropriate to the measurement. The first technique uses the Company's market capitalization as an estimate of fair value; the second technique estimates fair value using current market pricing multiples for companies comparable to the Company; while the third technique uses current market pricing multiples for change-of-control transactions involving companies comparable to the Company. Each measure indicated that the Company's fair value exceeded its book value, validating that goodwill is not impaired.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business the Company modifies loan terms on a case-by-case basis, including both consumer and commercial loans, for a variety of reasons. Modifications to consumer loans generally involve short-term deferrals to accommodate specific, temporary circumstances. The Company may grant extensions to borrowers who have demonstrated a willingness and ability to repay their loan but who are experiencing consequences of a specific unforeseen temporary hardship.\nAdditional information about securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can be found in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nC. Risk Elements\nNoninterest Expense\n\n (2) Loans are net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. \n \u25cf the Company's technology initiatives, and \nAppraisals and internal valuations provide an estimate of market value. Appraisals must conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice ( USPAP\u201d) and are prepared by an independent third-party appraiser who is certified and licensed and who is approved by the Company. Appraisals may incorporate market analysis, comparable sales analysis, cash flow analysis and market data pertinent to the property to determine market value.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on lease arrangements, contractual commitments with depositors, and service contracts. The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, except for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are included in Note 8, \"Employee Benefit Plans,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nLoans\n\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's securities and loans are subject to credit and interest rate risk, and its deposits are subject to interest rate risk. Management considers credit risk when a loan is granted and monitors credit risk after the loan is granted. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses in the collection of its loans. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to the allowance for loan losses. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has an asset/liability program to manage its interest rate risk. This program provides management with information related to the rate sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the effect of changing rates on profitability and capital accounts.\nReal estate acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure is held for sale and is stated at fair value of the property, less estimated disposal costs, if any. Any excess of cost over the fair value less costs to sell at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The fair value is reviewed periodically by management and any write-downs are charged against current earnings. Accounting policy and treatment is consistent with accounting for impaired loans described above.\nIndividually-evaluated impaired loans are valued using the appraised value of the underlying collateral or the present value of cash flows for each loan. Valuation procedures for impaired loans resulted in a required reserve for impaired loans of $177 at December 31, 2017, $26 at December 31, 2016 and $45 at December 31, 2015. The amount of the individual impaired loan balance that exceeds the fair value is accrued in the allowance for loan losses.\nThese forward-looking statements are based upon or are affected by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in:\nThe amount of net interest income earned is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, U.S. fiscal policy, the level and composition of the earning assets and the composition of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company has the ability to respond over time to interest rate movements and reduce volatility in the net interest margin. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments by management.\n\nThe Company considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates. Among the tools available to management is interest rate sensitivity analysis, which provides information related to repricing opportunities. Interest rate shock simulations indicate potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes. Shock analysis is a test that measures the effect of a hypothetical, immediate and parallel shift in interest rates. The following table shows the results of a rate shock and the effects on the return on average assets and the return on average equity projected at December 31, 2017 and 2016. For purposes of this analysis, noninterest income and expenses are assumed to be flat.\n \u25cf interest rates, \nThe Company codes modifications to assist in identifying troubled debt restructurings. The majority of modifications were granted for competitive reasons and did not constitute troubled debt restructurings. A description of modifications that did not result in troubled debt restructurings follows:\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nSimulation analysis is another tool available to the Company to test asset and liability management strategies under rising and falling rate conditions. As a part of the simulation process, certain estimates and assumptions must be made. These include, but are not limited to, asset growth, the mix of assets and liabilities, rate environment and local and national economic conditions. Asset growth and the mix of assets can, to a degree, be influenced by management. Other areas, such as the rate environment and economic factors, cannot be controlled. In addition, competitive pressures can make it difficult to price deposits and loans in a manner that optimally minimizes interest rate risk. Therefore, actual results may vary materially from any particular forecast or shock analysis. This shortcoming is offset somewhat by the periodic reforecasting of the balance sheet to reflect current trends and economic conditions. Shock analysis must also be updated periodically as a part of the asset and liability management process.\n (1) Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans in nonaccrual status. Accruing restructured loans are not included. \nD. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs\u201d)\n\nModifications of loan terms to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are made in an attempt to protect as much of the Company's investment in the loan as possible. The determination of whether a modification should be accounted for as a TDR requires significant judgment after consideration of all facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.\nThe Federal Reserve increased its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016 and raised rates by 25 basis points again in March, June and December, 2017, ending the year at a target of 1.50%. The rate increases positively affected the yield on the Company's interest-bearing deposits in other banks for 2017. The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.52% for 2016 to 1.10% for 2017. However, the interest rate environment during 2017 is still considered to be relatively low by historical standards.\nCollectively evaluated loans rated special mention\u201d were $3,361 at December 31, 2017, down from $13,519 at December 31, 2016. Collectively evaluated loans rated classified were $1,691 at December 31, 2017, down from $3,052 at December 31, 2016.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve was $319 at December 31, 2017, $257 at December 31, 2016 and $28 at December 31, 2015. The unallocated portion of the reserve is the amount that exceeds the calculated requirement for the allowance for loan losses. The Company's policy permits an unallocated reserve of up to 5% in excess of the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nTroubled debt restructurings are impaired loans and are measured for impairment under the same valuation methods as other impaired loans. Troubled debt restructurings are maintained in nonaccrual status until the loan has demonstrated reasonable assurance of repayment with at least six months of consecutive timely payment performance.\nThe Company accrues additional allocations for criticized loans within each class and for loans designated high risk. Criticized loans include classified loans as well as loans rated special mention\u201d. Loans rated special mention indicate weakened credit quality but to a lesser degree than classified loans. High risk loans are defined as junior lien mortgages, loans with high loan-to-value ratios and loans with terms that require interest only payments. Both criticized loans and high risk loans are included in the base risk analysis for each class and are allocated additional reserves.\nThe following table shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid, the average yield or rate on the daily average balance outstanding, net interest income and net yield on average interest-earning assets for the years indicated.\nLevels of high risk loans are considered in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan loss. High risk loans are defined by the Company as loans secured by junior liens, interest-only loans and loans with a high loan-to-value ratio. A decrease in the level of high risk loans within a class decreases the required allocation for the loan class, and an increase in the level of high risk loans within a class increases the required allocation for the loan class. Total high risk loans fell by $6,081 or 3.76% from the level at December 31, 2016, resulting in a decreased allocation.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\n\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nNBI's key growth indicators are shown in the following table:\nRisk-based capital ratios are calculated in compliance with Federal Reserve rules based on Basel III capital requirements. The Company's ratios are well above the required minimums at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nIn making investment decisions, management follows internal policy guidelines that help to limit risk by specifying parameters for both security quality and industry and geographic concentrations. Management regularly monitors the quality of the investment portfolio and tracks changes in financial markets. The value of individual securities will be written down if a decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary, given the totality of the circumstances.\nIndividually evaluated impaired loans totaled $11,924 on a gross basis and $11,919 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $177 at December 31, 2017. Individually evaluated impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were $9,173 on a gross basis and $9,168 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $26. The specific allocation is determined based on criteria particular to each impaired loan.\nThe Company experienced two intrusions to its digital systems, one in May 2016 and one in January 2017. Hackers and related organized criminal groups obtained unauthorized access to certain customer accounts. The attacks disabled certain systems protections, including limits on the number, amount, and frequency of ATM withdrawals. The attacks resulted in the theft of funds disbursed through ATMs. In the May 2016 attack, hackers accessed customer funds and in the January 2017 intrusion, the hackers artificially inflated account balances and did not access customer funds. The Company notified all affected customers, and restored all funds so that no customer experienced a loss.\n \u25cf demand for financial services in the Company's trade area, \nThe allowance for loan losses has been allocated according to the amount deemed necessary to provide for anticipated losses within the categories of loans for the years indicated as follows:\n\nA. Types of Loans\nWe have deployed a multi-faceted approach to limit the risk and impact of unauthorized access to customer accounts and to information relevant to customer accounts. We use digital technology safeguards, internal policies and procedures, and employee training to reduce the exposure of our systems to cyber-intrusions. However, it is not possible to fully eliminate exposure. The potential for financial and reputational losses due to cyber-breaches is increased by the possibility of human error, unknown system susceptibilities, and the rising sophistication of cyber-criminals to attack systems, disable safeguards and gain access to accounts and related information. The company has adopted new protections and invested additional resources to increase its security.\nTo monitor and estimate liquidity levels, the Company performs stress testing under varying assumptions on credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and amounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows. The Company's Contingency Funding Plan sets forth avenues for rectifying liquidity shortfalls. At December 31, 2017, the analysis indicated adequate liquidity under the tested scenarios.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company was not aware of any other known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has no material commitments for long-term debt or for capital expenditures.\nThe Company's risk analysis determined an allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, resulting in a provision for the year of $157. This compares with an allowance for loan losses of $8,300 as of December 31, 2016, and a provision of $1,650 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans decreased to 1.19%, from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses relies on historical charge-off trends, modified by trends in nonperforming loans and economic indicators. More information about the level and calculation methodology of the allowance for loan losses is provided in Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d, Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements,\u201d Balance Sheet - Loans - Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d as well as Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements.\nNational Bankshares, Inc. common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and is traded under the symbol NKSH.\u201d National Bankshares, Inc. has been included in the Russell Investments Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes since June 29, 2009.\nB. Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivities\nInterest on time deposits declined $170 from 2016 to 2017, with a decline of $74 due to rates and $96 due to decreased volume. See Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information related to the decline in interest expense.\nPerformance Summary\nThe following table presents aggregate amounts for nonaccrual loans, restructured loans in nonaccrual, other real estate owned net, and accruing loans which are contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments, and accruing restructured loans.\nIf the national economy or the Company's market area experience a downturn, it is likely that unemployment will rise and that other economic indicators will negatively impact the Company's trade area. Because of the importance to the Company's markets of state-funded universities, cutbacks in the funding provided by the Commonwealth could also negatively impact employment. This could lead to a higher rate of delinquent loans and a greater number of real estate foreclosures. Higher unemployment and the fear of layoffs causes reduced consumer demand for goods and services, which negatively impacts the Company's business and professional customers. An economic downturn could have an adverse effect on all financial institutions, including the Company.\nThe Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the estimated return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nThe Company utilizes several other strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity. Loan and deposit growth are managed to keep the loan to deposit ratio within the Company's own policy range of 65% to 75%. At December 31, 2017, the loan to deposit ratio was 63.04%, slightly below policy levels. The investment strategy takes into consideration the term of the investment, and securities in the available for sale portfolio are laddered based upon projected funding needs.\nThe Company treats cybersecurity risk seriously. The Company has a program to identify, mitigate and manage its cybersecurity risks. The program includes penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, technological defenses such as antivirus software, patch management, and firewall management, as well as ongoing employee training. In 2017, the Company also implemented additional email and web protections, an intrusion prevention system and an additional targeted cybersecurity insurance policy. The costs of these measures were $134 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $66 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These costs are included in various categories of noninterest expense.\n\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $2,055 due to rates, offset by an increase of $1,189 due to average volume, for a net decrease of $866 compared to 2015. Interest on non-taxable securities on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined $11 due to rates and $482 due to volume. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly. Interest on time deposits declined $152 from 2015 to 2016, with a decline of $36 due to rates and $116 due to decreased volume.\n (1) Includes contracts with a minimum annual payment of $100 \nFor collectively evaluated loans, the Company applies to each loan class a historical net charge-off rate, adjusted for qualitative factors that influence credit risk. Qualitative factors evaluated for impact to credit risk include economic measures, asset quality indicators, loan characteristics, and internal Bank policies and management.\nProbable loss is determined by applying historical net charge-off rates as well as additional percentages for trends and current levels of quantitative and qualitative factors. Loss rates are calculated for and applied to individual classes by averaging loss rates over the most recent 8 quarters. The look-back period of 8 quarters is applied consistently among all classes.\nThe following table sets forth time certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $250 or more:\nSubsequent events have been considered through the date on which the Form 10-K was issued.\nThe following tabulation shows average loan balances at the end of each period; changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off by loan category; and additions to the allowance which have been charged to operating expense:\nNet interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased $231 when 2017 is compared with 2016. Total interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $190 while total interest expense declined by $41. Declining yields impacted net interest income by $1,177, offset by increases due to volume of $1,408.\nThe total calculated allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, $8,300 as of December 31, 2016 and $8,297 as of December 31, 2015 indicated provision charges for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and $2,009 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to the discussion under Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information on the determination of the allowance for loan loss.\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other funds. The Company's net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates (rate).\nThe following table presents maturities and interest rate sensitivities for commercial non real estate, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans.\nThe following table presents NBI's key performance ratios for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nGeneral\nDeposits\nThe Company is not a party to derivative financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options. The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and recourse obligations in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 14, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Management does not plan any future involvement in high risk derivative products. The Company has investments in mortgage-backed securities, principally GNMA's and FNMA's, with a fair value of approximately $889. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe majority of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations held at December 31, 2017 were backed by U.S. agencies. Certain holdings are required to be periodically subjected to the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council's (FFIEC) high risk mortgage security test. These tests address possible fluctuations in the average life and variances caused by the change in rate times the change in volume that have been allocated to rate and volume changes proportional to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Except for U.S. Government securities, the Company has no securities with any issuer that exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity.\nIn 2016, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $3,042 and that had total principal balances of $2,761 as of December 31, 2016. All of the restructured loans that defaulted in 2016 had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\nOperating leases are for buildings used in the Company's day-to-day operations.\n\nB. Time Deposits of $250 or More\nAnalysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense\nTrust fees at $1,530 increased by $184 or 13.67% when the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are compared. For the year ended December 31, 2016 trust fees were $1,346, an increase of $117, or 9.52%, from 2015. Trust fees are generated from a number of different types of accounts, including estates, personal trusts, employee benefit trusts, investment management accounts, attorney-in-fact accounts and guardianships. Trust income varies depending on the number and type of accounts under management and financial market conditions. The mix of account types also affected the level of trust fees in 2016 and 2017.\nThe effects of changing interest rates are primarily managed through adjustments to the loan portfolio and deposit base, to the extent competitive factors allow. The investment portfolio is generally longer term. Adjustments for asset and liability management are made when securities are called or mature and funds are subsequently reinvested. Securities may be sold for reasons related to credit quality or regulatory limitations, and in limited circumstances, securities available for sale have been disposed of for interest rate risk management. No trading activity for this purpose is planned in the foreseeable future, though it does remain an option.\nMaturities and Associated Yields\nManagement's analysis of the loan portfolio and pertinent economic conditions resulted in a determination of the allowance for loan losses for collectively-evaluated loans of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017, $8,275 or 1.30% at December 31, 2016, and $8,252 or 1.37% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for collectively-evaluated loans is determined by applying historical charge-off percentages, as well as additional accruals for internal and external credit risk factors to groups of collectively-evaluated loans. The ratio decreased from 2016 to 2017 due to a decreased charge-off ratio, down from 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also contributing to the reduced allowance requirement were improved asset quality indicators, lower levels of high risk loans and favorable economic indicators. The ratio decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to decreases in net charge-offs. When compared with 2015, the level of the allowance for loan losses for 2016 also benefitted from improvements in asset quality, high risk loans and economic indicators.\nIn both 2017 and 2016, the Company's growth was internally generated and was not the result of acquisitions or other borrowings.\n (1) Loans are presented on a gross basis. \nCredit card fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $150 above the $3,798 reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. From 2015 to 2016, credit card fees decreased $63, or 1.63%. Credit card fees are dependent on the volume of transactions.\nModifications to commercial loans may include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rate, maturity, amortization and financial covenants. In the original underwriting, loan terms are established that represent the then-current and projected financial condition of the borrower. If the modified terms are consistent with competitive market conditions and representative of terms the borrower could otherwise obtain in the open market, the modified loan is not categorized as a TDR.\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $199 when 2017 is compared with 2016, the result of an increase of $640 due to volume offset by a decline of $839 due to rates. Taxable-equivalent interest on non-taxable securities declined $36 due to rates and $434 due to volume. The low interest rate environment in 2016 resulted in a large number of called securities at a time when re-investment opportunities were less attractive than the yields on the original called securities. The lower yields available upon reinvestment of the call securities negatively impacted income from securities during 2017. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly.\n\n \u25cf demand for loan products, \nFederal Reserve policies and market forces influence the Company's net interest margin. Because interest rates continue at relatively low levels, the Company expects that interest rates will likely increase in the future. The Company anticipates any rate increases will have a positive impact on the Company's future net interest income. Management cannot predict the timing and level of interest rate movements.\nThe Company bases collateral method fair valuation upon the as-is\u201d value of independent appraisals or evaluations. Valuations for impaired loans with outstanding principal balances of $250 or more are based on a current appraisal. Appraisals are also used to value impaired loans with principal balances of $100 or greater and secured by one piece of collateral. Collateral-method impaired loans with principal balances below $100, or if secured by multiple pieces of collateral, below $250, are valued using an internal evaluation.\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nInternal evaluations are prepared by third party providers and reviewed by employees of the Company who are independent of the loan origination, operation, management and collection functions. Evaluations provide a property's market value based on the property's current physical condition and characteristics and the economic market conditions that affect the collateral's market value. Evaluations incorporate multiple sources of data to arrive at a property's market value, including physical inspection, independent third-party automated tools, comparable sales analysis and local market information.\nCredit card processing expense was $2,748 for the period ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $34, or 1.22% from 2016's total of $2,782. Credit card processing expense in 2016 increased $90, or 3.34% from 2015. This expense is driven by the volume of credit card, debit card and merchant account transactions and by the level of merchant discount fees. It is subject to a degree of variability.\nThe Company retained a nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the May 2016 intrusion and a separate nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the January 2017 intrusion. The firms provided the Company with recommendations concerning its systems and procedures. The Company adopted and implemented all of the recommendations resulting from the investigation of the May 2016 intrusion and has implemented most of the recommendations from the investigation of the January 2017 intrusion, with targeted completion for all such recommendations in 2018.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to net interest income on a GAAP basis.\nNon-impaired loans and smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and not part of a larger impaired relationship are grouped by portfolio segments. Portfolio segments are further divided into smaller loan classes. Loans within a segment or class have similar risk characteristics.\nManagement analyzes many factors to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and resultant provision expense, including the historical loss rate, the quality of the loan portfolio as determined by management, diversification as to type of loans in the portfolio, internal policies and economic factors. Management considers net charge-offs over the most recent eight quarters to determine the historical loss rate to be applied to the calculation. The historical loss rate contributes significantly to the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company charges off commercial real estate loans at the time that a loss is confirmed. When delinquency status or other information indicates that the borrower will not repay the loan, the Company considers collateral value based upon a current appraisal or internal evaluation. Any loan amount in excess of collateral value is charged off and the collateral is taken into other real estate owned.\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. Although the economics of the Company's transactions may not change, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change.\nPlease refer to Note 5 for information on the effect of default on the allowance for loan losses.\nNonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans ( troubled debt restructurings\u201d or TDR loans\u201d) in nonaccrual status, but do not include accruing loans 90 days or more past due or accruing restructured loans. Troubled debt restructurings are discussed in detail under the section titled D. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR Loans)\u201d below. Impaired loans, or loans for which management does not expect to collect at the original loan terms, but which may or may not be nonperforming, are presented in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity from securities is restricted by accounting and business considerations. The securities portfolio is segregated into available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. The Company considers only securities designated available-for-sale for typical liquidity needs. Further, portions of the securities portfolio are pledged to meet state requirements for public funds deposits. Discount window borrowings also require pledged securities. Increased/decreased liquidity from public funds deposits or discount window borrowings results in increased/decreased liquidity from pledging requirements. The Company monitors public funds pledging requirements and unpledged available-for-sale securities accessible for liquidity needs.\nEstimation of the allowance for loan losses\nThe calculation of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses incorporates analysis of multiple factors and requires management's prudent and informed judgment. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017 is 1.19%, a decrease from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loan losses to collectively-evaluated loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs was 1.18%, compared with 1.30% at December 31, 2016. Improvements from December 31, 2016 in the charge-off rate, nonaccrual loans, criticized loans, unemployment, personal bankruptcies and housing inventory decreased the required level of the allowance for loan losses, slightly offset by worsening in business bankruptcies, residential vacancy and the impact of the interest rate environment. Based on analysis of historical indicators, asset quality and economic factors, management believes the level of allowance for loan losses is reasonable for the credit risk in the loan portfolio.\nOverview\nThe net interest margin decreased from 3.51% at year-end 2016 to 3.45% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin benefitted from Federal Reserve interest rate increases, but reflected downward repricing of loans for competitive purposes, as well as the Company's asset liability management practices.\nTotal impaired loans at December 31, 2017 were $11,924, of which $2,763 were in nonaccrual status. Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,173 and $15,346, of which $5,404 and $6,532 were in nonaccrual status, respectively.\n \u25cf general economic conditions, \nWe make forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals, and are based upon our management's views and assumptions as of the date of this report. The words believes,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d projects,\u201d contemplates,\u201d anticipates,\u201d forecasts,\u201d intends,\u201d or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nOther income is income from smaller balance accounts that cannot be classified in another category. Some examples include gains on mortgage loans sold, net gains from the sale of fixed assets and revenue from investment and insurance sales. Other income for 2017 was $1,148, a decrease of $141, or 10.94%, when compared with $1,289 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In December 2017, the Company sold its Marion branch office and realized a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $134. This was offset by a decline of $69 in the gain on the sale of mortgage loans due to lower volume, and a decline of $230 due to a one-time vendor signing incentive received in 2016. Other income decreased slightly from 2015 to 2016.\nNet charge-off rates for each class are averaged over 8 quarters (2 years) to determine the historical net charge off rate applied to each class of collectively evaluated loans. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $532 or 0.08% of average loans, an improvement from $1,647 or 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $1,975 or 0.32% of loans. Increases in the net charge-off rate increase the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while decreases in the net charge-off rate decrease the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans.\n\n \u25cf the legislative/regulatory climate, \nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the description of our Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nAsset quality indicators affect the level of the allowance for loan losses. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days were 0.34% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, a decrease from 0.39% at December 31, 2016. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were 0.01% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, the same level as December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans decreased to 0.41% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, from 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Decreases in past due and nonaccrual loans reduce the required level of the allowance for loan losses, while increases in past due and nonaccrual loans increase the required level of the allowance for loan losses.\n\n\nThe Company sells mortgages on the secondary market subject to recourse agreements. The mortgages originated must meet strict underwriting and documentation requirements for the sale to be completed. The Company estimates a potential loss reserve for recourse provisions. The amount is not material as of December 31, 2017. To date, no recourse provisions have been invoked.\nCybersecurity Risks and Incidents\nTaxable equivalent interest income on loans increased $600 when 2017 and 2016 are compared. The average balance of loans increased from $622,239 in 2016 to $653,756 in 2017, increasing interest income by $1,491. Lower yields reduced interest income by $891.\nTotal stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 was $184,896, an increase of $6,633, or 3.72%, from the $178,263 at December 31, 2016. The largest component of 2017 stockholders' equity was retained earnings of $185,893, which included net income of $14,092, offset by dividends of $8,141. Total stockholders' equity increased by $6,149 or 3.57%, from $172,114 on December 31, 2015 to $178,263 on December 31, 2016.\n\n\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $1,256,757, an increase of $22,815 or 1.85%, over the total of $1,233,942 on December 31, 2016. For 2017, the growth in assets was entirely internally generated and was not the result of acquisitions. Total assets at December 31, 2016 were up by $30,423, or 2.53%, over the total at December 31, 2015.\n", "item_7_text": "Key indicators of NBI's asset quality are presented in the following table:\nRegulatory capital levels determine the Company's ability to use purchased deposits and the Federal Reserve discount window. At December 31, 2017, the Company is considered well capitalized and does not have any restrictions on purchased deposits or borrowing ability at the Federal Reserve discount window.\nGrowth\nProbable losses are accrued through two calculations, individual evaluation of impaired loans and collective evaluation of the remainder of the portfolio. Impaired loans are larger non-homogeneous loans for which there is a probability that collection will not occur according to the loan terms, as well as loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Impaired loans that are not TDR's with an estimated impairment loss are placed on nonaccrual status. TDR's with an impairment loss may accrue interest if they have demonstrated six months of timely payment performance.\nDuring 2017, the Company sold a small investment in community bank stock that resulted in a gain of $4. All other realized gains and losses on securities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted from calls of securities. The Company did not sell any securities in 2016 or 2015.\nOccupancy, furniture and fixtures expense was $1,820 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $29, or 1.57%, from the prior year. The decrease stemmed from higher expenditures on security equipment and building maintenance in the previous year. The 2016 total was $1,849, an increase of $106, or 6.08%, from the $1,743 reported at year-end 2015.\n (2) Noninterest Margin - Noninterest expense (excluding the provision for bad debts and income taxes) less noninterest income (excluding securities gains and losses) divided by average year-to-date assets. \nThe appraisal or evaluation value for a collateral-dependent loan for which recovery is expected solely from the sale of collateral is reduced by estimated selling costs. Estimated losses on collateral-dependent loans, as well as any other impairment loss considered uncollectible, are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Impairment losses that are not considered uncollectible or for loans that are not collateral dependent are accrued in the allowance. Impaired loans with partial charge-offs are maintained as impaired until the remaining balance is satisfied. Smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and are not part of a larger impaired relationship are collectively evaluated.\nNoninterest income from bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) increased, from $597 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $758 for 2017. The Company purchased an additional $10 million in BOLI in June 2017. BOLI income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $603. Income from bank-owned life insurance was affected by the performance of the variable rate policies, which has not varied significantly.\n\nWhen 2016 is compared with 2015, taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $2,193. Total interest expense declined by $17, while interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased $2,210. Declining yields impacted net interest income by $2,862, offset by increases due to favorable changes in volume of $669.\nPension Plan\n\nAverage amounts and average rates paid on deposit categories are presented below:\nNational Bankshares, Inc. is a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of Virginia. Located in southwest Virginia, NBI has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, the National Bank of Blacksburg and National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. The National Bank of Blacksburg ( NBB\u201d), which does business as National Bank from twenty-five office locations and one loan production office, is a community bank. NBB is the source of nearly all of the Company's revenue. National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. ( NBFS\u201d) does business as National Bankshares Investment Services and National Bankshares Insurance Services. Income from NBFS is not significant at this time, nor is it expected to be so in the near future.\n\nAsset Quality\n$ in thousands, except per share data\n\nStandby letters of credit are also issued to the bank's customers. There are two types of standby letters of credit. The first is a guarantee of payment to facilitate customer purchases. The second type is a performance letter of credit that guarantees a payment if the customer fails to perform a specific obligation. Revenue from these letters was approximately $57 in 2017.\nThe expense for intangibles amortization is related to acquisitions. There were no acquisitions in the last year, and the expense for 2017 decreased from 2016 by $189 or 73.54%. The decrease in core deposit intangibles amortization is due to certain core deposit intangibles becoming fully amortized in late 2015, the first half of 2016, and the first quarter of 2017. The expense for intangibles amortization decreased $742 from 2015 to 2016.\nTotal assets experienced growth in 2017, funded by increases in customer deposits. Customer deposits grew $16,292 or 1.56% from December 31, 2016, with increases mainly from municipal deposits and individuals seeking to safeguard principal by avoiding more volatile investments in financial markets. The liquidity provided by customer deposits supported growth in loans of $20,692 or 3.24%. Securities increased by $19,342 or 4.39%.\nA. Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of this discussion and analysis is to provide information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of National Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company\u201d). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the material presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe fair value of securities available for sale was $331,387, an increase of $27,105 or 8.91% from December 31, 2016. The amortized cost of securities held to maturity was $127,164 at December 31, 2017 and $134,957 at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $7,793 or 5.77%.\nOther service charges and fees include charges for official checks, income from the sale of checks to customers, safe deposit box rent, fees from letters of credit and income from commissions on the sale of credit life, accident and health insurance. These fees were $205 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $7, or 3.30%, from the $212 for 2016. The total for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3 below the $215 posted for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAn analysis of the allowance for loan losses by impairment basis follows:\nThe estimate of the allowance for December 31, 2017 considered market and portfolio conditions during 2017 as well as the levels of delinquencies and net charge-offs in the eight quarters prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2017. If the economy experiences a downturn, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. For additional discussion of the allowance, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Asset Quality,\u201d and Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nThe noninterest margin decreased from 1.36% to 1.34% over the same period, while basic net earnings per common share decreased from $2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.03 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCertain key judgments were used in the valuation measurement. Goodwill is held by the Company's bank subsidiary. The bank subsidiary is 100% owned by the Company, and no market capitalization is available. Because most of the Company's assets are comprised of the subsidiary bank's equity, the Company's market capitalization was used to estimate the Bank's market capitalization. Other judgments include the assumption that the companies and transactions used as comparables for the second and third technique were appropriate to the estimate of the Company's fair value, and that the comparable multiples are appropriate indicators of fair value, and compliant with accounting guidance.\n\nThe financial impact of the attacks include the amount of the theft, as well as costs of investigation and remediation. The theft of funds totaled $570 in the May 2016 attack and $1,838 in the January 2017 attack. The Company recognized an estimated loss of $347 in 2016 within other operating expenses, and currently recognizes an insurance receivable in other assets of $2,061. The Company filed an insurance claim in 2017 for both of the breaches and is awaiting a response from the insurance company. The Company has had no adverse communication from the insurance company. Costs for investigation, remediation, and legal consultation totaled $407 in 2017 and $46 in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has appropriately accounted for the breaches. There has been no litigation to date associated with the breaches.\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) the Company intends to sell the security or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, the Company must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. The Company regularly reviews each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, the Company's best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, the Company's intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nCollectively evaluated loans totaled $656,758 on a gross basis and $656,150 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, collectively evaluated loans totaled $639,373 on a gross basis and $638,584 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with an allowance of $8,274 or 1.30%.\nThe primary source of funds used to support the Company's interest-earning assets is deposits. Deposits are obtained in the Company's trade area through traditional marketing techniques. Other funding sources, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, while available, are only used occasionally. The cost of funds is dependent on interest rate levels and competitive factors. This limits the ability of the Company to react to interest rate movements.\nThe Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in December 2016 and three times in 2017. The rate increases had a direct and immediate effect on the Company's interest-bearing deposits. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits increased $460 due to rates, but declined by $201 due to reduced volume, for a net increase of $259 when 2017 is compared with 2016. The Company's securities and loan portfolios did not experience a similar increase in yields due to the longer-term nature of the portfolios, reinvestment opportunities in the bond market and the competitive lending environment of the Company's market area.\nNet costs of other real estate owned decreased from $472 for the period ended December 31, 2016 to $205 for the year ended December 31, 2017. From 2015 to 2016, net costs of other real estate owned decreased $136 from $608. This expense category varies with the number of foreclosed properties owned by NBB and with the expense associated with each. It includes write-downs on other real estate owned plus other costs associated with carrying these properties, as well as net gains or losses on the sale of other real estate. In 2017, write-downs on other real estate were $113. This compares with $268 in 2016 and $440 in 2015. Other real estate is initially accounted for at fair value less estimated costs to sell using current valuations, which include appraisals, real estate evaluations and realtor market opinions. If new valuation information indicates a decline from the initial basis, the Company records a write-down. Other costs for these properties in 2017 were $80, compared with $118 in 2016. The Company recorded a loss of $12 on the sale of OREO in 2017 and a loss of $86 for 2016. The Company's market area is showing mixed economic signs, with some favorable indicators and some unfavorable indicators, and we anticipate that there may be additional foreclosures in the future. The Company currently does not have any loans in process of foreclosure.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company's loan categorization reflects its approach to loan portfolio management and includes six groups. Real estate construction loans include construction loans for residential and commercial properties, as well as land. Consumer real estate loans include conventional and junior lien mortgages, equity lines and investor-owned residential real estate. Commercial real estate loans are comprised of owner-occupied and leased nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multi-family residence loans and farmland. Commercial non real estate loans include agricultural loans, operating capital lines and loans secured by capital assets. Public sector and IDA loans are extended to municipalities. Consumer non real estate loans include automobile loans, personal loans, credit cards and consumer overdrafts.\nThe estimation of the allowance involves analysis of internal and external variables, methodologies, assumptions and our judgment and experience. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for loan losses include internal risk rating determinations, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions. These judgments are inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimate. Future estimates of the allowance could increase or decrease based on changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, concentrations of various types of loans, economic conditions or the markets in which collateral may be sold. The estimate of the allowance accrual determines the amount of provision expense and directly affects our financial results.\nAn extension defers monthly payments and requires a balloon payment at the original contractual maturity. If the temporary event is not expected to impact a borrower's ability to repay the debt, and if the Company expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay at contractual maturity, the modification is not designated a TDR.\nEffects of Inflation\n(1) Rates shown represent weighted average yield on a fully taxable basis.\nRestructuring generally results in loans with either lower payments or an extended maturity beyond that originally required, and are expected to have a lower risk of loss due to nonperformance than loans classified as nonperforming. In 2017, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $1,387 and that have total principal balances of $1,369 as of December 31, 2017. Some of the Company's restructured loans defaulted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company defines default as a delay in one payment of more than 90 days or foreclosure after the date of restructuring. All of the restructured loans that defaulted had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\n\n\nThe Company considers other factors that impact credit risk, including the legal and regulatory environments, changes to lending policies and loan review, and management's experience. Each of the factors remained at similar levels to December 31, 2016.\nThe Company monitors factors that may increase its liquidity needs. Some of these factors include deposit trends, large depositor activity, maturing deposit promotions, interest rate sensitivity, maturity and repricing timing gaps between assets and liabilities, the level of unfunded loan commitments and loan growth. At December 31, 2017, the Company's liquidity is sufficient to meet projected trends in these areas.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\nModifications in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and for which the Company makes a concession to the original contractual loan terms are designated troubled debt restructurings.\nThe securities portfolio is subject to the volatility and risk in the financial markets. The risk in financial markets affects the Company in the same way that it affects other institutional and individual investors. The Company's investment portfolio includes corporate bonds. If, because of economic hardship, the corporate issuers were to default, there could be a delay in the payment of interest, or there could be a loss of principal and accrued interest. To date, there have been no defaults in any of the corporate bonds held in the portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio also contains a large percentage of municipal bonds. If economic forces reduce the ability of states and municipalities to make scheduled principal and interest payments on their outstanding indebtedness, or if their income from taxes and other sources declines significantly, states and municipalities could default on their bond obligations. There have been no defaults among the municipal bonds in the Company's investment portfolio. The fair value of our bond portfolio is affected by interest rates. The fair value of available for sale securities is reflected on the Company's balance sheet, while held to maturity securities are reported at amortized cost.\n \u25cf the real estate market in the Company's trade area, \nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\n (1) Interest on nontaxable loans and securities is computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a Federal income tax rate of 35% in the three years presented. \nLiquidity measures the Company's ability to meet its financial commitments at a reasonable cost. Demands on the Company's liquidity include funding additional loan demand and accepting withdrawals of existing deposits. The Company has diverse liquidity sources, including customer and purchased deposits, customer repayments of loan principal and interest, sales, calls and maturities of securities, Federal Reserve discount window borrowing, short-term borrowing, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. At December 31, 2017, the bank did not have discount window borrowings, short-term borrowings, or FHLB advances. To assure that short-term borrowing is readily available, the Company tests accessibility annually.\nQualitative factors are evaluated and allocations are applied to each class. Qualitative factors include delinquency rates, loan quality and concentrations, loan officers' experience, changes in lending policies and changes in the loan review process. Economic factors such as unemployment rates, bankruptcy rates and others are evaluated, with standard allocations applied consistently to relevant classes.\nThe Company has restructured loan terms for certain qualified financially distressed borrowers who have agreed to work in good faith and have demonstrated the ability to make the restructured payments in order to avoid a foreclosure. All TDR loans are individually evaluated for impairment for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses. TDR loans with an impairment loss or that do not demonstrate current payments for at least six months are maintained on nonaccrual until the borrower demonstrates sustained repayment history under the restructured terms and continued repayment is not in doubt. Otherwise, interest income is recognized using a cost recovery method.\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to recent accounting pronouncements.\nService charges on deposit accounts totaled $2,776 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This is an increase of $318, or 12.94%, from $2,458 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $208, or 9.24%, from 2015 to 2016. This income category is affected by the number of deposit accounts, the level of service charges and the number of checking account overdrafts. The 2017 increase resulted primarily from an increase of $325 in non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees due to implementation of a new overdraft privilege program during the second half of 2016. The 2016 increase resulted primarily from an increase of $224 in non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees due to implementation of the overdraft privilege program.\nIncome Taxes\nTwo loss rates for each class are calculated: total net charge-offs for the class as a percentage of average class loan balance ( class loss rate\u201d), and total net charge-offs for the class as a percentage of average classified loans in the class ( classified loss rate\u201d). Classified loans are those with risk ratings that indicate credit quality is substandard\u201d, doubtful\u201d or loss\u201d. Net charge-offs in both calculations include charge-offs and recoveries of classified and non-classified loans as well as those associated with impaired loans. Class historical loss rates are applied to collectively-evaluated non-classified loan balances, and classified historical loss rates are applied to collectively-evaluated classified loan balances.\nThe Company's risk analysis at December 31, 2017 determined an allowance for loan losses of $7,925 or 1.19% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, a decrease from $8,300 or 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses resulted in a provision for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. To determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, the Company considers credit risk for certain loans designated as impaired and for non-impaired ( collectively evaluated\u201d) loans.\nWhile the asset/liability planning program is designed to protect the Company over the long term, it does not provide near-term protection from interest rate shocks, as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not by their nature move up or down in tandem in response to changes in the overall rate environment. The Company's profitability in the near term may be temporarily negatively affected in a period of rapidly rising or rapidly falling rates, because it takes some time for the Company to change its rates to adjust to a new interest rate environment. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to fair value of financial instruments and comments concerning interest rate sensitivity.\nThe Company had $7,897 in TDRs as of December 31, 2017 and $8,456 as of December 31, 2016. Accruing TDR loans amounted to $5,134 at December 31, 2017 compared to $3,769 at December 31, 2016.\nOther Than Temporary Impairment of Securities ( OTTI\u201d)\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n \u25cf monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the impact of any policies or programs implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and other financial reform legislation, \nNoninterest Income\nSufficient resources have been dedicated to working out problem assets, and exposure to loss is somewhat mitigated because most of the nonperforming loans are collateralized. More information about nonaccrual and past due loans is provided in Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements\u201d and Note 5 to the financial statements. The Company continues to monitor risk levels within the loan portfolio and expects that any further increase in the allowance for loan losses would be the result of the refinement of loss estimates and would not dramatically affect net income.\n\nThe Company monitors asset quality indicators in managing credit risk and in determining the allowance and provision for loan losses. At December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were $2,769 or 0.41% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. This compares to $5,855 or 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at year-end 2017 totaled $51, a decrease of $12 or 19.05%, from $63 at December 31, 2016. The net charge-off ratio decreased from 0.26% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017, while other real estate owned decreased $339 for the same period.\nLoan loss and other indicators related to asset quality are presented in the Loan Loss Data table.\n \u25cf unanticipated increases in the level of unemployment in the Company's trade area, \nSalary and benefits expense increased $954, or 7.46%, from $12,792 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $13,746 for 2017. Employee salaries increased $256 or 2.63% which was the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. Expense associated with the health insurance reserve increased $419. The Company participates in a self-funded\u201d insurance plan and reserves amounts based on employee health insurance usage and calculated projections. In 2016, the Company benefitted from refunds due to a change in the calculation of the required minimum reserve and from positive claims history. The Company began in 2017, a new incentive compensation program for senior employees, which contributed $280 to the increase. The increases were offset by a $101 decrease in salary expense related to deferred costs associated with loan production. Salary and benefits expense increased $270, or 2.16%, from $12,522 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12,792 for 2016. From 2015 to 2016, employee salaries increased $695 or 7.70%, which were the result of normal staffing and compensation decisions. This was offset by a $680 reduction in fringe benefits and a reduction of $171 in BOLI and salary continuation expenses.\nWhile it would be possible for customers to fully draw on approved lines of credit and for beneficiaries to call all letters of credit, historically this has not occurred. In the event of a sudden and substantial draw on these lines, the Company has its own lines of credit from which it can draw funds. A sale of loans or investments would also be an option.\nImpaired loans are identified through the Company's credit risk rating process. Estimated loss for an impaired loan is the amount of recorded investment that exceeds the loan's fair value. Fair value of an impaired loan is measured by one of three methods: the fair value of collateral ( collateral method\u201d), the present value of future cash flows ( cash flow method\u201d), or observable market price. The Company applies the collateral method to collateral-dependent loans, loans for which foreclosure is imminent and to loans for which the fair value of collateral is a more reliable estimate of fair value. The cash flow method is applied to loans that are not collateral dependent and for which cash flows may be estimated.\nThe following table presents the maturities for securities available for sale and held to maturity at their carrying values as of December 31, 2017 and weighted average yield for each range of maturities.\n\nLoan Loss Data Table\n (2) Loan fees of $303 in 2017, $360 in 2016 and $448 in 2015 are included in total interest income. \nWhen the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are compared, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment expense decreased $112 or 23.53%. The total expense for 2017 was $364, which compares with $476 for 2016. The FDIC assessment is accrued based on a method provided by the FDIC. The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reached a target threshold during the second quarter of 2016, resulting in lower FDIC insurance expense for many federally insured institutions. The FDIC assessment expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $70 from $546 for 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAssuming all other TDR criteria are met, the Company considers one or a combination of the following concessions to the loan terms to indicate TDR status: a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with a similar term and similar risk, or forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income generally reflect the effects of inflation. Since interest rates, loan demand and deposit levels are related to inflation, the resulting changes are included in net income. The most significant item which does not reflect the effects of inflation is depreciation expense. Historical dollar values used to determine depreciation expense do not reflect the effects of inflation on the market value of depreciable assets after their acquisition.\nData processing and ATM expense was $2,275 in 2017, $2,186 in 2016 and $1,657 in 2015. The increase of $89 or 4.07% from 2016 to 2017 was due to increased maintenance expense associated with infrastructure upgrades. The Company is committed to maintaining up-to-date technology in a cost-effective manner.\nBalance Sheet\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to an additional capital conservation buffer in order to make capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. The implementation period for the capital conservation buffer began in 2016 and will be fully phased in January 1, 2019, with .625% added each year and a final buffer of 2.5% in excess of regulatory capital minimum ratios.\nIn the normal course of business the Company's banking affiliate extends lines of credit to its customers. Amounts drawn upon these lines vary at any given time depending on the business needs of the customers.\n (1) Net Interest Margin - Year-to-date tax equivalent net interest income divided by year-to-date average earning assets. \nLower interest rates led to a decline of $1,214 in interest income from loans. The average balance of loans increased from $620,547 in 2015 to $622,239 in 2016, causing an increase in interest income of $85.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans improved from 141.76% in 2016 to 286.20% in 2017. The Company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate for the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\n \u25cf competition, \nB. Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nImpaired loans\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $37,135, an increase of $371, or 1.01%, when compared to the prior year. The net interest margin for 2017 was 3.45%, compared to 3.51% for 2016. Total interest income for the period ended December 31, 2017 was $41,260, an increase of $330 from the period ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense declined by $41 during the same time frame, from $4,166 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4,125 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline in interest expense came about in part because higher priced certificates of deposit renewed at lower interest rates and because of the continued migration of time deposits to lower-cost non-time deposits. In addition, low-rate interest-bearing deposits volume increased substantially. Please refer to the section titled Analysis of Changes In Interest Income and Interest Expense\u201d for further information related to rate and volume changes.\n \u25cf applicable accounting principles, policies and guidelines. \nAnalysis of Net Interest Earnings\nFranchise taxes were $1,315 for the period ended December 31, 2017 and $1,296 for 2016, an increase of $19 or 1.47%. Franchise tax expense increased $8 in 2016 from $1,288 in 2015. State bank franchise taxes are based upon NBB's total equity, which increased in both 2016 and 2017.\nUpdated appraisals or evaluations are ordered when the loan becomes impaired if the appraisal or evaluation on file is more than twelve months old. Appraisals and evaluations are reviewed for propriety and reasonableness and may be discounted if the Company determines that the value exceeds reasonable levels. If an updated appraisal or evaluation has been ordered but has not been received by a reporting date, the fair value may be based on the most recent available appraisal or evaluation, discounted for age.\n (1) Loans are presented on a gross basis. \nEconomic indicators that improved from December 31, 2016 were lower unemployment, lower personal bankruptcies and lower housing inventory for sale in the Company's market area. Improved economic indicators result in a lower requirement for the allowance for loan losses. Economic indicators that negatively impacted credit risk included elevated business bankruptcies and increases in the interest rate environment, when data at December 31, 2017 are compared with data at December 31, 2016. Residential vacancy rates resulted in a slightly larger allowance, and the competitive environment remained at a similar level to that at December 31, 2016.\nEconomic factors influence credit risk and impact the allowance for loan loss. The Company considers economic indicators that impact its markets, including: unemployment, personal bankruptcy filings, business bankruptcy filings, the interest rate environment, residential vacancy rates, housing inventory for sale, and the competitive environment. Lower unemployment lowers credit risk and the necessary allowance for loan losses, while higher unemployment increases credit risk. Higher bankruptcy filings indicate heightened credit risk and increase the allowance for loan losses, while lower bankruptcy filings have a beneficial impact on credit risk. The interest rate environment impacts variable rate loans. As interest rates increase, the payment on variable rate loans increases, increasing credit risk. Residential vacancy rates and housing inventory for sale impact the Company's residential construction customers and the consumer real estate market. Higher levels increase credit risk. Higher competition for loans increases credit risk, while lower competition decreases credit risk.\nGoodwill\nRisk based capital ratios are shown in the following tables.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance is funded by the provision for loan losses, reduced by charge-offs of loans and increased by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. The determination of the allowance is based on two accounting principles, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 450-20 (Contingencies) which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, and ASC Topic 310-10 (Receivables) which requires accrual of losses on impaired loans if the recorded investment exceeds fair value.\nLiquidity\nCollectively-evaluated loans\nThe return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.14%, a decrease from 1.24% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The return on average equity decreased from 8.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 7.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoans rated special mention\u201d and classified\u201d (together, criticized assets\u201d) indicate heightened credit risk. Higher levels of criticized assets increase the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while lower levels of criticized assets reduce the required level of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loans. Loans rated special mention receive a 50% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors, and loans rated classified receive a 100% greater allocation for qualitative risk factors. A classified loss rate is also applied to classified loans, calculated as net charge offs divided by classified loans.\n (5) Daily averages are shown at amortized cost. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n (1) Taxable equivalent basis using a Federal income tax rate of 35% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. (2) Variances caused by the change in rate times the change in volume have been allocated to rate and volume changes proportional to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. \n \u25cf the quality or composition of the loan and/or investment portfolios, \nTotal deposits increased by $16,292 or 1.56%, from $1,043,442 at December 31, 2016 to $1,059,734 at December 31, 2017. Total deposits grew $24,583, or 2.41%, from $1,018,859 at December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. A portion of the increase in both 2017 and 2016 is attributable to a higher level of municipal deposits. The increases in total deposits for 2017 and 2016 were internally generated and not the result of acquisitions.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was $6,293 compared to $3,952 in 2016 and $4,740 in 2015. During the three years reported, the Company's marginal tax rate was 35%. The Company's effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 30.87%, 20.92% and 23.04%, respectively. The expected income tax expense based on the Company's marginal tax rate differs from the actual income tax expense due to tax exempt income on municipal securities and loans as well as the re-valuation of deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) was enacted and is effective January 1, 2018. The Act will reduce the Company's tax rate to 21%. As a result of the change in the Company's future tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) require revaluation in 2017 of deferred tax assets to the rate at which they will be realized. During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a revaluation adjustment of $1.56 million, with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for addition information relating to income taxes.\nThe Company's off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017 are detailed in the table below.\n \u25cf deposit flows, \nDerivatives and Market Risk Exposures\nSecurities\nCapital Resources\n\nA. Average Amounts of Deposits and Average Rates Paid\nThe category of other operating expenses includes noninterest expense items such as professional services, stationery and supplies, telephone costs and charitable donations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other operating expenses were $4,431. This compares with $4,042 for 2016 and $3,580 for 2015. The $389 increase from 2016 to 2017 was due to a loss of $189 resulting from a wire fraud and an increase in expenses associated with the overdraft program, legal fees, and audit and consulting services. The $462 increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of the recognition of $347 in bankcard losses.\nGoodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. The Company performs impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company's most recent impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accounting guidance provides the option of performing preliminary assessment of qualitative factors before performing more substantial testing for impairment. The Company opted not to perform the preliminary assessment. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis considered three valuation techniques appropriate to the measurement. The first technique uses the Company's market capitalization as an estimate of fair value; the second technique estimates fair value using current market pricing multiples for companies comparable to the Company; while the third technique uses current market pricing multiples for change-of-control transactions involving companies comparable to the Company. Each measure indicated that the Company's fair value exceeded its book value, validating that goodwill is not impaired.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business the Company modifies loan terms on a case-by-case basis, including both consumer and commercial loans, for a variety of reasons. Modifications to consumer loans generally involve short-term deferrals to accommodate specific, temporary circumstances. The Company may grant extensions to borrowers who have demonstrated a willingness and ability to repay their loan but who are experiencing consequences of a specific unforeseen temporary hardship.\nAdditional information about securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can be found in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nC. Risk Elements\nNoninterest Expense\n\n (2) Loans are net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. \n \u25cf the Company's technology initiatives, and \nAppraisals and internal valuations provide an estimate of market value. Appraisals must conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice ( USPAP\u201d) and are prepared by an independent third-party appraiser who is certified and licensed and who is approved by the Company. Appraisals may incorporate market analysis, comparable sales analysis, cash flow analysis and market data pertinent to the property to determine market value.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on lease arrangements, contractual commitments with depositors, and service contracts. The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, except for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are included in Note 8, \"Employee Benefit Plans,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nLoans\n\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's securities and loans are subject to credit and interest rate risk, and its deposits are subject to interest rate risk. Management considers credit risk when a loan is granted and monitors credit risk after the loan is granted. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses in the collection of its loans. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to the allowance for loan losses. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has an asset/liability program to manage its interest rate risk. This program provides management with information related to the rate sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the effect of changing rates on profitability and capital accounts.\nReal estate acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure is held for sale and is stated at fair value of the property, less estimated disposal costs, if any. Any excess of cost over the fair value less costs to sell at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The fair value is reviewed periodically by management and any write-downs are charged against current earnings. Accounting policy and treatment is consistent with accounting for impaired loans described above.\nIndividually-evaluated impaired loans are valued using the appraised value of the underlying collateral or the present value of cash flows for each loan. Valuation procedures for impaired loans resulted in a required reserve for impaired loans of $177 at December 31, 2017, $26 at December 31, 2016 and $45 at December 31, 2015. The amount of the individual impaired loan balance that exceeds the fair value is accrued in the allowance for loan losses.\nThese forward-looking statements are based upon or are affected by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in:\nThe amount of net interest income earned is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, U.S. fiscal policy, the level and composition of the earning assets and the composition of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company has the ability to respond over time to interest rate movements and reduce volatility in the net interest margin. However, the frequency and/or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments by management.\n\nThe Company considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates. Among the tools available to management is interest rate sensitivity analysis, which provides information related to repricing opportunities. Interest rate shock simulations indicate potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes. Shock analysis is a test that measures the effect of a hypothetical, immediate and parallel shift in interest rates. The following table shows the results of a rate shock and the effects on the return on average assets and the return on average equity projected at December 31, 2017 and 2016. For purposes of this analysis, noninterest income and expenses are assumed to be flat.\n \u25cf interest rates, \nThe Company codes modifications to assist in identifying troubled debt restructurings. The majority of modifications were granted for competitive reasons and did not constitute troubled debt restructurings. A description of modifications that did not result in troubled debt restructurings follows:\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nSimulation analysis is another tool available to the Company to test asset and liability management strategies under rising and falling rate conditions. As a part of the simulation process, certain estimates and assumptions must be made. These include, but are not limited to, asset growth, the mix of assets and liabilities, rate environment and local and national economic conditions. Asset growth and the mix of assets can, to a degree, be influenced by management. Other areas, such as the rate environment and economic factors, cannot be controlled. In addition, competitive pressures can make it difficult to price deposits and loans in a manner that optimally minimizes interest rate risk. Therefore, actual results may vary materially from any particular forecast or shock analysis. This shortcoming is offset somewhat by the periodic reforecasting of the balance sheet to reflect current trends and economic conditions. Shock analysis must also be updated periodically as a part of the asset and liability management process.\n (1) Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans in nonaccrual status. Accruing restructured loans are not included. \nD. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs\u201d)\n\nModifications of loan terms to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are made in an attempt to protect as much of the Company's investment in the loan as possible. The determination of whether a modification should be accounted for as a TDR requires significant judgment after consideration of all facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.\nThe Federal Reserve increased its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016 and raised rates by 25 basis points again in March, June and December, 2017, ending the year at a target of 1.50%. The rate increases positively affected the yield on the Company's interest-bearing deposits in other banks for 2017. The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.52% for 2016 to 1.10% for 2017. However, the interest rate environment during 2017 is still considered to be relatively low by historical standards.\nCollectively evaluated loans rated special mention\u201d were $3,361 at December 31, 2017, down from $13,519 at December 31, 2016. Collectively evaluated loans rated classified were $1,691 at December 31, 2017, down from $3,052 at December 31, 2016.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve was $319 at December 31, 2017, $257 at December 31, 2016 and $28 at December 31, 2015. The unallocated portion of the reserve is the amount that exceeds the calculated requirement for the allowance for loan losses. The Company's policy permits an unallocated reserve of up to 5% in excess of the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nTroubled debt restructurings are impaired loans and are measured for impairment under the same valuation methods as other impaired loans. Troubled debt restructurings are maintained in nonaccrual status until the loan has demonstrated reasonable assurance of repayment with at least six months of consecutive timely payment performance.\nThe Company accrues additional allocations for criticized loans within each class and for loans designated high risk. Criticized loans include classified loans as well as loans rated special mention\u201d. Loans rated special mention indicate weakened credit quality but to a lesser degree than classified loans. High risk loans are defined as junior lien mortgages, loans with high loan-to-value ratios and loans with terms that require interest only payments. Both criticized loans and high risk loans are included in the base risk analysis for each class and are allocated additional reserves.\nThe following table shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid, the average yield or rate on the daily average balance outstanding, net interest income and net yield on average interest-earning assets for the years indicated.\nLevels of high risk loans are considered in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan loss. High risk loans are defined by the Company as loans secured by junior liens, interest-only loans and loans with a high loan-to-value ratio. A decrease in the level of high risk loans within a class decreases the required allocation for the loan class, and an increase in the level of high risk loans within a class increases the required allocation for the loan class. Total high risk loans fell by $6,081 or 3.76% from the level at December 31, 2016, resulting in a decreased allocation.\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d)\n\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nNBI's key growth indicators are shown in the following table:\nRisk-based capital ratios are calculated in compliance with Federal Reserve rules based on Basel III capital requirements. The Company's ratios are well above the required minimums at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nIn making investment decisions, management follows internal policy guidelines that help to limit risk by specifying parameters for both security quality and industry and geographic concentrations. Management regularly monitors the quality of the investment portfolio and tracks changes in financial markets. The value of individual securities will be written down if a decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary, given the totality of the circumstances.\nIndividually evaluated impaired loans totaled $11,924 on a gross basis and $11,919 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $177 at December 31, 2017. Individually evaluated impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were $9,173 on a gross basis and $9,168 net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs, with specific allocations to the allowance for loan losses of $26. The specific allocation is determined based on criteria particular to each impaired loan.\nThe Company experienced two intrusions to its digital systems, one in May 2016 and one in January 2017. Hackers and related organized criminal groups obtained unauthorized access to certain customer accounts. The attacks disabled certain systems protections, including limits on the number, amount, and frequency of ATM withdrawals. The attacks resulted in the theft of funds disbursed through ATMs. In the May 2016 attack, hackers accessed customer funds and in the January 2017 intrusion, the hackers artificially inflated account balances and did not access customer funds. The Company notified all affected customers, and restored all funds so that no customer experienced a loss.\n \u25cf demand for financial services in the Company's trade area, \nThe allowance for loan losses has been allocated according to the amount deemed necessary to provide for anticipated losses within the categories of loans for the years indicated as follows:\n\nA. Types of Loans\nWe have deployed a multi-faceted approach to limit the risk and impact of unauthorized access to customer accounts and to information relevant to customer accounts. We use digital technology safeguards, internal policies and procedures, and employee training to reduce the exposure of our systems to cyber-intrusions. However, it is not possible to fully eliminate exposure. The potential for financial and reputational losses due to cyber-breaches is increased by the possibility of human error, unknown system susceptibilities, and the rising sophistication of cyber-criminals to attack systems, disable safeguards and gain access to accounts and related information. The company has adopted new protections and invested additional resources to increase its security.\nTo monitor and estimate liquidity levels, the Company performs stress testing under varying assumptions on credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and amounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows. The Company's Contingency Funding Plan sets forth avenues for rectifying liquidity shortfalls. At December 31, 2017, the analysis indicated adequate liquidity under the tested scenarios.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company was not aware of any other known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has no material commitments for long-term debt or for capital expenditures.\nThe Company's risk analysis determined an allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, resulting in a provision for the year of $157. This compares with an allowance for loan losses of $8,300 as of December 31, 2016, and a provision of $1,650 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans decreased to 1.19%, from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses relies on historical charge-off trends, modified by trends in nonperforming loans and economic indicators. More information about the level and calculation methodology of the allowance for loan losses is provided in Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d, Balance Sheet - Loans - Risk Elements,\u201d Balance Sheet - Loans - Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d as well as Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements.\nNational Bankshares, Inc. common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and is traded under the symbol NKSH.\u201d National Bankshares, Inc. has been included in the Russell Investments Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes since June 29, 2009.\nB. Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivities\nInterest on time deposits declined $170 from 2016 to 2017, with a decline of $74 due to rates and $96 due to decreased volume. See Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information related to the decline in interest expense.\nPerformance Summary\nThe following table presents aggregate amounts for nonaccrual loans, restructured loans in nonaccrual, other real estate owned net, and accruing loans which are contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments, and accruing restructured loans.\nIf the national economy or the Company's market area experience a downturn, it is likely that unemployment will rise and that other economic indicators will negatively impact the Company's trade area. Because of the importance to the Company's markets of state-funded universities, cutbacks in the funding provided by the Commonwealth could also negatively impact employment. This could lead to a higher rate of delinquent loans and a greater number of real estate foreclosures. Higher unemployment and the fear of layoffs causes reduced consumer demand for goods and services, which negatively impacts the Company's business and professional customers. An economic downturn could have an adverse effect on all financial institutions, including the Company.\nThe Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the estimated return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nThe Company utilizes several other strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity. Loan and deposit growth are managed to keep the loan to deposit ratio within the Company's own policy range of 65% to 75%. At December 31, 2017, the loan to deposit ratio was 63.04%, slightly below policy levels. The investment strategy takes into consideration the term of the investment, and securities in the available for sale portfolio are laddered based upon projected funding needs.\nThe Company treats cybersecurity risk seriously. The Company has a program to identify, mitigate and manage its cybersecurity risks. The program includes penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, technological defenses such as antivirus software, patch management, and firewall management, as well as ongoing employee training. In 2017, the Company also implemented additional email and web protections, an intrusion prevention system and an additional targeted cybersecurity insurance policy. The costs of these measures were $134 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $66 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These costs are included in various categories of noninterest expense.\n\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $2,055 due to rates, offset by an increase of $1,189 due to average volume, for a net decrease of $866 compared to 2015. Interest on non-taxable securities on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined $11 due to rates and $482 due to volume. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly. Interest on time deposits declined $152 from 2015 to 2016, with a decline of $36 due to rates and $116 due to decreased volume.\n (1) Includes contracts with a minimum annual payment of $100 \nFor collectively evaluated loans, the Company applies to each loan class a historical net charge-off rate, adjusted for qualitative factors that influence credit risk. Qualitative factors evaluated for impact to credit risk include economic measures, asset quality indicators, loan characteristics, and internal Bank policies and management.\nProbable loss is determined by applying historical net charge-off rates as well as additional percentages for trends and current levels of quantitative and qualitative factors. Loss rates are calculated for and applied to individual classes by averaging loss rates over the most recent 8 quarters. The look-back period of 8 quarters is applied consistently among all classes.\nThe following table sets forth time certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $250 or more:\nSubsequent events have been considered through the date on which the Form 10-K was issued.\nThe following tabulation shows average loan balances at the end of each period; changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off by loan category; and additions to the allowance which have been charged to operating expense:\nNet interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased $231 when 2017 is compared with 2016. Total interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $190 while total interest expense declined by $41. Declining yields impacted net interest income by $1,177, offset by increases due to volume of $1,408.\nThe total calculated allowance for loan losses of $7,925 at December 31, 2017, $8,300 as of December 31, 2016 and $8,297 as of December 31, 2015 indicated provision charges for loan losses of $157 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, $1,650 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and $2,009 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Please refer to the discussion under Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional information on the determination of the allowance for loan loss.\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other funds. The Company's net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates (rate).\nThe following table presents maturities and interest rate sensitivities for commercial non real estate, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans.\nThe following table presents NBI's key performance ratios for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nGeneral\nDeposits\nThe Company is not a party to derivative financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options. The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and recourse obligations in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. See Note 14, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Management does not plan any future involvement in high risk derivative products. The Company has investments in mortgage-backed securities, principally GNMA's and FNMA's, with a fair value of approximately $889. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to securities.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe majority of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations held at December 31, 2017 were backed by U.S. agencies. Certain holdings are required to be periodically subjected to the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council's (FFIEC) high risk mortgage security test. These tests address possible fluctuations in the average life and variances caused by the change in rate times the change in volume that have been allocated to rate and volume changes proportional to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Except for U.S. Government securities, the Company has no securities with any issuer that exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity.\nIn 2016, the Company modified loans in troubled debt restructurings that, directly prior to restructuring, totaled $3,042 and that had total principal balances of $2,761 as of December 31, 2016. All of the restructured loans that defaulted in 2016 had been modified more than twelve months prior to default.\nOperating leases are for buildings used in the Company's day-to-day operations.\n\nB. Time Deposits of $250 or More\nAnalysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense\nTrust fees at $1,530 increased by $184 or 13.67% when the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are compared. For the year ended December 31, 2016 trust fees were $1,346, an increase of $117, or 9.52%, from 2015. Trust fees are generated from a number of different types of accounts, including estates, personal trusts, employee benefit trusts, investment management accounts, attorney-in-fact accounts and guardianships. Trust income varies depending on the number and type of accounts under management and financial market conditions. The mix of account types also affected the level of trust fees in 2016 and 2017.\nThe effects of changing interest rates are primarily managed through adjustments to the loan portfolio and deposit base, to the extent competitive factors allow. The investment portfolio is generally longer term. Adjustments for asset and liability management are made when securities are called or mature and funds are subsequently reinvested. Securities may be sold for reasons related to credit quality or regulatory limitations, and in limited circumstances, securities available for sale have been disposed of for interest rate risk management. No trading activity for this purpose is planned in the foreseeable future, though it does remain an option.\nMaturities and Associated Yields\nManagement's analysis of the loan portfolio and pertinent economic conditions resulted in a determination of the allowance for loan losses for collectively-evaluated loans of $7,748 or 1.18% at December 31, 2017, $8,275 or 1.30% at December 31, 2016, and $8,252 or 1.37% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for collectively-evaluated loans is determined by applying historical charge-off percentages, as well as additional accruals for internal and external credit risk factors to groups of collectively-evaluated loans. The ratio decreased from 2016 to 2017 due to a decreased charge-off ratio, down from 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also contributing to the reduced allowance requirement were improved asset quality indicators, lower levels of high risk loans and favorable economic indicators. The ratio decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to decreases in net charge-offs. When compared with 2015, the level of the allowance for loan losses for 2016 also benefitted from improvements in asset quality, high risk loans and economic indicators.\nIn both 2017 and 2016, the Company's growth was internally generated and was not the result of acquisitions or other borrowings.\n (1) Loans are presented on a gross basis. \nCredit card fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $150 above the $3,798 reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. From 2015 to 2016, credit card fees decreased $63, or 1.63%. Credit card fees are dependent on the volume of transactions.\nModifications to commercial loans may include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rate, maturity, amortization and financial covenants. In the original underwriting, loan terms are established that represent the then-current and projected financial condition of the borrower. If the modified terms are consistent with competitive market conditions and representative of terms the borrower could otherwise obtain in the open market, the modified loan is not categorized as a TDR.\nInterest income on taxable securities decreased $199 when 2017 is compared with 2016, the result of an increase of $640 due to volume offset by a decline of $839 due to rates. Taxable-equivalent interest on non-taxable securities declined $36 due to rates and $434 due to volume. The low interest rate environment in 2016 resulted in a large number of called securities at a time when re-investment opportunities were less attractive than the yields on the original called securities. The lower yields available upon reinvestment of the call securities negatively impacted income from securities during 2017. Because of low yields in the securities markets and a highly competitive loan environment, the Company priced deposits accordingly.\n\n \u25cf demand for loan products, \nFederal Reserve policies and market forces influence the Company's net interest margin. Because interest rates continue at relatively low levels, the Company expects that interest rates will likely increase in the future. The Company anticipates any rate increases will have a positive impact on the Company's future net interest income. Management cannot predict the timing and level of interest rate movements.\nThe Company bases collateral method fair valuation upon the as-is\u201d value of independent appraisals or evaluations. Valuations for impaired loans with outstanding principal balances of $250 or more are based on a current appraisal. Appraisals are also used to value impaired loans with principal balances of $100 or greater and secured by one piece of collateral. Collateral-method impaired loans with principal balances below $100, or if secured by multiple pieces of collateral, below $250, are valued using an internal evaluation.\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nInternal evaluations are prepared by third party providers and reviewed by employees of the Company who are independent of the loan origination, operation, management and collection functions. Evaluations provide a property's market value based on the property's current physical condition and characteristics and the economic market conditions that affect the collateral's market value. Evaluations incorporate multiple sources of data to arrive at a property's market value, including physical inspection, independent third-party automated tools, comparable sales analysis and local market information.\nCredit card processing expense was $2,748 for the period ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $34, or 1.22% from 2016's total of $2,782. Credit card processing expense in 2016 increased $90, or 3.34% from 2015. This expense is driven by the volume of credit card, debit card and merchant account transactions and by the level of merchant discount fees. It is subject to a degree of variability.\nThe Company retained a nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the May 2016 intrusion and a separate nationally recognized firm to investigate and remediate the January 2017 intrusion. The firms provided the Company with recommendations concerning its systems and procedures. The Company adopted and implemented all of the recommendations resulting from the investigation of the May 2016 intrusion and has implemented most of the recommendations from the investigation of the January 2017 intrusion, with targeted completion for all such recommendations in 2018.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to net interest income on a GAAP basis.\nNon-impaired loans and smaller homogeneous impaired loans that are not troubled debt restructurings and not part of a larger impaired relationship are grouped by portfolio segments. Portfolio segments are further divided into smaller loan classes. Loans within a segment or class have similar risk characteristics.\nManagement analyzes many factors to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and resultant provision expense, including the historical loss rate, the quality of the loan portfolio as determined by management, diversification as to type of loans in the portfolio, internal policies and economic factors. Management considers net charge-offs over the most recent eight quarters to determine the historical loss rate to be applied to the calculation. The historical loss rate contributes significantly to the required level for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company charges off commercial real estate loans at the time that a loss is confirmed. When delinquency status or other information indicates that the borrower will not repay the loan, the Company considers collateral value based upon a current appraisal or internal evaluation. Any loan amount in excess of collateral value is charged off and the collateral is taken into other real estate owned.\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. Although the economics of the Company's transactions may not change, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change.\nPlease refer to Note 5 for information on the effect of default on the allowance for loan losses.\nNonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans ( troubled debt restructurings\u201d or TDR loans\u201d) in nonaccrual status, but do not include accruing loans 90 days or more past due or accruing restructured loans. Troubled debt restructurings are discussed in detail under the section titled D. Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR Loans)\u201d below. Impaired loans, or loans for which management does not expect to collect at the original loan terms, but which may or may not be nonperforming, are presented in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity from securities is restricted by accounting and business considerations. The securities portfolio is segregated into available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. The Company considers only securities designated available-for-sale for typical liquidity needs. Further, portions of the securities portfolio are pledged to meet state requirements for public funds deposits. Discount window borrowings also require pledged securities. Increased/decreased liquidity from public funds deposits or discount window borrowings results in increased/decreased liquidity from pledging requirements. The Company monitors public funds pledging requirements and unpledged available-for-sale securities accessible for liquidity needs.\nEstimation of the allowance for loan losses\nThe calculation of the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses incorporates analysis of multiple factors and requires management's prudent and informed judgment. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017 is 1.19%, a decrease from 1.28% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for collectively-evaluated loan losses to collectively-evaluated loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs was 1.18%, compared with 1.30% at December 31, 2016. Improvements from December 31, 2016 in the charge-off rate, nonaccrual loans, criticized loans, unemployment, personal bankruptcies and housing inventory decreased the required level of the allowance for loan losses, slightly offset by worsening in business bankruptcies, residential vacancy and the impact of the interest rate environment. Based on analysis of historical indicators, asset quality and economic factors, management believes the level of allowance for loan losses is reasonable for the credit risk in the loan portfolio.\nOverview\nThe net interest margin decreased from 3.51% at year-end 2016 to 3.45% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin benefitted from Federal Reserve interest rate increases, but reflected downward repricing of loans for competitive purposes, as well as the Company's asset liability management practices.\nTotal impaired loans at December 31, 2017 were $11,924, of which $2,763 were in nonaccrual status. Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,173 and $15,346, of which $5,404 and $6,532 were in nonaccrual status, respectively.\n \u25cf general economic conditions, \nWe make forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals, and are based upon our management's views and assumptions as of the date of this report. The words believes,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d projects,\u201d contemplates,\u201d anticipates,\u201d forecasts,\u201d intends,\u201d or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nOther income is income from smaller balance accounts that cannot be classified in another category. Some examples include gains on mortgage loans sold, net gains from the sale of fixed assets and revenue from investment and insurance sales. Other income for 2017 was $1,148, a decrease of $141, or 10.94%, when compared with $1,289 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In December 2017, the Company sold its Marion branch office and realized a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $134. This was offset by a decline of $69 in the gain on the sale of mortgage loans due to lower volume, and a decline of $230 due to a one-time vendor signing incentive received in 2016. Other income decreased slightly from 2015 to 2016.\nNet charge-off rates for each class are averaged over 8 quarters (2 years) to determine the historical net charge off rate applied to each class of collectively evaluated loans. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $532 or 0.08% of average loans, an improvement from $1,647 or 0.26% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $1,975 or 0.32% of loans. Increases in the net charge-off rate increase the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans, while decreases in the net charge-off rate decrease the required allowance for collectively-evaluated loans.\n\n \u25cf the legislative/regulatory climate, \nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the description of our Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nAsset quality indicators affect the level of the allowance for loan losses. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days were 0.34% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, a decrease from 0.39% at December 31, 2016. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were 0.01% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, the same level as December 31, 2016. Nonaccrual loans decreased to 0.41% of total loans, net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs at December 30, 2017, from 0.90% at December 31, 2016. Decreases in past due and nonaccrual loans reduce the required level of the allowance for loan losses, while increases in past due and nonaccrual loans increase the required level of the allowance for loan losses.\n\n\nThe Company sells mortgages on the secondary market subject to recourse agreements. The mortgages originated must meet strict underwriting and documentation requirements for the sale to be completed. The Company estimates a potential loss reserve for recourse provisions. The amount is not material as of December 31, 2017. To date, no recourse provisions have been invoked.\nCybersecurity Risks and Incidents\nTaxable equivalent interest income on loans increased $600 when 2017 and 2016 are compared. The average balance of loans increased from $622,239 in 2016 to $653,756 in 2017, increasing interest income by $1,491. Lower yields reduced interest income by $891.\nTotal stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 was $184,896, an increase of $6,633, or 3.72%, from the $178,263 at December 31, 2016. The largest component of 2017 stockholders' equity was retained earnings of $185,893, which included net income of $14,092, offset by dividends of $8,141. Total stockholders' equity increased by $6,149 or 3.57%, from $172,114 on December 31, 2015 to $178,263 on December 31, 2016.\n\n\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $1,256,757, an increase of $22,815 or 1.85%, over the total of $1,233,942 on December 31, 2016. For 2017, the growth in assets was entirely internally generated and was not the result of acquisitions. Total assets at December 31, 2016 were up by $30,423, or 2.53%, over the total at December 31, 2015.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>
