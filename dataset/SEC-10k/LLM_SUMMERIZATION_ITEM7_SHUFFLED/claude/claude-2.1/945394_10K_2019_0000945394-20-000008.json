Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts and per room hotel data)\nWe are a REIT organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 1,145 properties in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet for an aggregate transaction value of $2,482,382. The portfolio consisted of 767 service-oriented retail properties net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands including quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott, which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, historically referred to as the Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing on January 1, 2020. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta pursuant to which we and Sonesta modified our existing business arrangements. Additional details regarding this transaction are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nManagement agreements and leases. At February 26, 2020, we owned 329 hotels operated under six agreements. We leased 328 of these hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that are managed by hotel operating companies and one is leased to a hotel operating company. We own 816 service-oriented properties with 194 tenants subject to triple net\u201d leases, where the tenants are generally responsible for payment of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our consolidated statements of comprehensive income include hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses of our managed hotels and rental income and other operating expenses from our leased hotels and net lease properties.\nMany of our operating agreements contain security features, such as guarantees and security deposits, which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our agreements regardless of property performance. However, the effectiveness of various security features to provide us uninterrupted receipt of minimum returns and rents is not assured, especially if economic conditions generally decline for a prolonged period. Also, certain of the guarantees that we hold are limited in amount and duration and do not provide for payment of the entire amount of the applicable minimum returns.\nHotel Portfolio\nComparable hotels data. We present RevPAR, average daily rate, or ADR, and occupancy for the periods presented on a comparable basis to facilitate comparisons between periods. We generally define comparable hotels as those that were owned by us and were open and operating for the entire periods being compared. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we excluded 10 hotels from our comparable results. Six of these hotels were not owned for the entire periods and four were closed for major renovations during part of the periods presented.\nHotel operations. In 2019, the U.S. hotel industry generally realized increases in ADR and RevPAR and no change in occupancy compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018 produced aggregate year over year decreases in ADR and RevPAR and a decline in occupancy. We believe these results are, in part, due to the disruption and displacement at certain of our hotels undergoing renovations, increased competition from new hotel room supply in certain markets and decreased business activity in areas where some of our hotels are located.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018, ADR decreased 1.1% to $126.30, occupancy decreased 0.3 percentage points to 73.0% and RevPAR decreased 1.5% to $92.20.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for all our 329 hotels, ADR decreased 1.5% to $128.76, occupancy decreased 0.9 percentage points to 72.5% and RevPAR decreased 2.7% to $93.35.\nNet Lease Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 816 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 14.9 million square feet and annual minimum rent of $381,679, which represented approximately 38% of our total annual minimum returns and rents. Our net lease portfolio was 98% occupied as of December 31, 2019 by 194 tenants with a weighted (by annual minimum rent) lease term of 11.4 years, operating under 131 brands in 23 distinct industries. TA is our largest tenant. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 179 of our travel centers to TA under five leases that expire between 2029 and 2035 and require annual minimum rents of $246,088, which represents 24.6% of our consolidated annual minimum rents and returns.\nAdditional details of our hotel operating agreements and net lease agreements are set forth in Notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the table and notes thereto on pages 74 through 76 below.\nResults of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,989,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,958,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income -

For a comparison of consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 please see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nHotel operating revenues. The increase in hotel operating revenues is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,364), increased revenues at certain of our managed hotels due to increases in ADR and higher occupancies ($49,888) and the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,427), partially offset by decreased revenues at certain of our managed hotels primarily as a result of lower occupancies ($44,167) and decreased revenues at certain of our other managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($32,937). Additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page 76.\nRental income - hotels. The decrease in rental income - hotels is primarily the result of a previously deferred gain from a historical lease default becoming fully amortized in 2018 ($3,631), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($2,812) and amending the lease terms for 48 vacation units we lease at one hotel during 2019 ($1,265), partially offset by contractual rent increases under certain of our hotel leases ($49). We reduced rental income by $985 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $382 in the 2018 period to record rent on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2018 includes $147 of percentage rental income. No percentage rent was earned under our hotel leases in 2019.\nRental income net lease portfolio. The decrease in rental income - net lease portfolio is a result of the sale of 20 travel centers to TA and our lease amendments with TA in January 2019 ($47,628), partially offset by rents related to properties acquired pursuant to the SMTA Transaction ($46,717). See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these transactions. We reduced rental income by $9,734 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $12,127 in the 2018 period to record scheduled rent increases under certain leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our TA leases and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2019 and 2018 includes $4,238 and $3,548, respectively, of percentage rental income.\nFF&E Reserve income. FF&E reserve income represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures. The terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels. We do not report the amounts, if any, which are escrowed as FF&E reserves for our managed hotels as FF&E reserve income. The decrease in FF&E reserve income is the result of decreased sales at certain of our leased hotels in 2019.\nHotel operating expenses. The increase in hotel operating expenses is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,738), an increase in wage and benefit costs, sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs at certain of our managed hotels resulting primarily from higher occupancies and general expense increases ($31,216), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,642) and an increase in real estate taxes at certain of our hotels ($1,988), partially offset by operating expense decreases at certain managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($33,382), an increase in the amount of guaranty and security deposit utilization under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($24,331) and a decrease in the amount of guaranty and security deposit replenishment under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($10,009). Certain guarantees and security deposits which have been applied to past payment deficits may be replenished from a share of subsequent cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements. When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were increased by $734 and $10,743 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such replenishments. When our guarantees and security deposits are utilized to cover shortfalls of hotels' cash flows from the minimum payments due to us, we reflect such utilizations in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a decrease to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were decreased by $29,897 and $5,569 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such utilization.\nOther operating expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is a result of operating expenses we pay at certain properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization - hotels. The increase in depreciation and amortization - hotels is a result of the depreciation and amortization of improvements acquired with funds from our FF&E reserves or directly funded by us since January 1, 2018 ($24,072) and our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($5,778), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2018 ($17,521).\nDepreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio. The increase in depreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio is a result of the net lease properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction ($32,023) and the depreciation and amortization of travel center improvements we purchased since January 1, 2018 ($438), partially offset by our travel center dispositions since January 1, 2018 ($11,175) and certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2018 ($8,244).\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative costs is primarily due to a decrease in business management incentive fee expense ($53,635), partially offset by a loss contingency ($1,997) and increased business management fees ($1,665) in 2019.\nAcquisition and transaction related costs. Acquisition and transaction related costs represent costs related to our exploration of possible financing transactions.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded a $39,296 loss on asset impairment during 2019 to reduce the carrying value of 19 net lease properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and two hotels to their estimated fair value.\nGain on sale of real estate. We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate in 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the dividends we received from our former investment in RMR Inc.\nUnrealized losses on equity securities. Unrealized losses on equity securities represent the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of our investments in RMR Inc., which we sold in July 2019, and TA common shares to their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nInterest income. The increase in interest income is due to higher average cash and restricted cash balances during 2019.\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense is due to higher average outstanding borrowings, primarily as a result of our financing of the SMTA Transaction, and a higher weighted average interest rate in 2019.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss of $8,451 on early extinguishment of debt in 2019 resulting from the termination of a term loan commitment we arranged in connection with the SMTA Transaction. We recorded a loss of $160 on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility and term loan.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized higher state taxes during the 2019 period primarily due to an increase in the amount of state sourced income subject to income taxes.\nEquity in earnings of an investee. Equity in earnings of an investee represents our proportionate share of the earnings of Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC.\nNet income. Our net income, net income per common share (basic and diluted) each increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\nOur Managers and Tenants\nAs of February 26, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) are included in six combination portfolio agreements and all 329 hotels were managed by or leased to hotel operating companies. Our 816 net lease properties are leased to 194 tenants as of December 31, 2019. The costs of operating and maintaining our properties are generally paid by the hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account. Our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses and for returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and, to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and rents, from their separate resources. Our hotel managers and tenants include Marriott, IHG, Sonesta, Wyndham, Hyatt and Radisson. TA is our largest net lease tenant. No other net lease tenant represents more than 1% of our total annualized minimum returns or rents.\nWe define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total hotel property level revenues minus all hotel property level expenses and FF&E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us divided by the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us. More detail regarding coverage, guarantees and other features of our hotel operating agreements is presented in the tables and related notes on pages 74 through 76. For the year ended December 31, 2019, five of our six hotel operating agreements, representing 42.5% of our total annual minimum returns and minimum rents, generated coverage of less than 1.0x (with a range of 0.50x to 0.93x).\nWe define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us, weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve month period based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating information furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. Properties for which tenants do not report operating information are excluded from the coverage calculations. As of December 31, 2019, our net lease properties generated coverage of 2.32x.\nCertain of our management arrangements or leases are subject to full or limited guarantees or are secured by a security deposit which we control. These guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us. Some of our managers and tenants, or their affiliates, may also supplement cash flows from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees or security deposits. Guarantee payments, security deposit applications or supplemental payments to us, if any, made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations, but, under some of our agreements, the manager or tenant may recover these guarantee or supplemental payments and the security deposits may be replenished from subsequent cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and rents are paid.\nWhen cash flows from our hotels under certain of our agreements are less than the minimum returns or rents contractually due to us, we have utilized the applicable security features in our agreements to cover some of these shortfalls. However, several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts, are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire, especially if our hotel renovation and rebranding activities do not result in improved operating results at these hotels. Accordingly, the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured. If any of our hotel managers, tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us, our cash flows will decline and we may become unable to continue to pay distributions to our shareholders or the amount of the distributions may decline.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, which we historically referred to as our Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing January 1, 2020, or the Marriott Agreement. The Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements included 122 hotels, provided for aggregate annual minimum returns and rents due to us of $192,774 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2019, respectively. The previously available guarantee under the Marriott No. 234 agreement of $30,672 expired on December 31, 2019. The then existing security deposit held by us for the Marriott No. 234 agreement ($33,445 as of December 31, 2019) will continue to secure payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us under the Marriott Agreement and may be replenished up to the security deposit cap of $64,700 from 60% of the cash flows realized from operations of the 122 hotels after payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us, Marriott's base management fees and certain other advances by us or Marriott, if any. Marriott provided a new $30.0 million limited guaranty for 85% of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us through 2026 under the Marriott Agreement if the security deposit is exhausted. Under the Marriott Agreement, we agreed to fund approximately $400,000 for capital improvements at certain hotels over a four year period. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta and Holdco pursuant to which we and Sonesta restructured our existing business arrangements, as follows:\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We amended and restated our existing management agreements with Sonesta for each of our hotels currently managed by Sonesta, which we refer to collectively as our Sonesta agreement, and our existing pooling agreement with Sonesta, which combines our management agreements with Sonesta for purposes of calculating gross revenues, payment of hotel operating expenses, payment of fees and distributions and minimum returns due to us, as further described below;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We and Sonesta agreed to sell, rebrand or repurpose our 39 extended stay hotels currently managed by Sonesta, with an aggregate carrying value of $480,547 and which currently require aggregate minimum returns of $49,467.

Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Item 9B. Other information and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe are exiting our relationship with Wyndham. On November 1, 2019, we rebranded two full-service hotels previously managed by Wyndham in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA to the Sonesta brands. We also lease 48 vacation units in the Chicago, IL Sonesta hotel to a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (NYSE: WYND), or Destinations, which requires annual minimum rent of $1,537. We amended this lease so the term of the lease expires on March 31, 2020, at which time Destinations will vacate the leased space.\nWe amended our agreement with Wyndham in 2019 whereby the term of the management agreement will expire on September 30, 2020 unless sooner terminated with respect to any of our Wyndham hotels that are sold or rebranded. We expect to sell the remaining 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham by that expiration date. Wyndham was previously paying us 85% of the annual minimum returns due under the management agreement. Under the amendment, Wyndham will pay to us all available cash flows of the hotels after payment of hotel operating expenses. Wyndham will not be entitled to any base management fees for the remainder of the agreement term.\nOur Operating Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to our shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels, minimum rents from our leased hotel and net lease portfolio and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We receive minimum returns and rents from our managers and tenants monthly. We may receive additional returns, percentage rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions, if any, either monthly or quarterly, and these amounts are usually subject to annual reconciliations. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. However, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our managers and tenants may become unable or unwilling to pay minimum returns and rents to us when due, and, as a result, our cash flows and net income would decline and we may need to reduce the amount of, or even eliminate, our distributions to common shareholders.\nChanges in our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows: (1) cash flows provided by operating activities increased from $596,953 in 2018 to $617,722 in 2019; (2) cash used in investing activities increased from $427,742 in 2018 to $2,130,044 in 2019; and (3) cash flows from financing activities changed from $190,704 of cash used by financing activities in 2018 to $1,517,578 of cash provided in financing activities in 2019.\nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in incentive business management fees paid to RMR LLC in 2019 with respect to 2018, and an increase in the minimum returns and rents paid to us as a result of our acquisitions and funding of improvements to certain properties since January 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in security deposits received or replenished in 2019 and higher interest payments in 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to our higher real estate acquisition activity in 2019 and an increase in our capital improvement fundings, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and a decrease in our hotel managers' purchases with FF&E reserves in 2018. The change to cash flows provided by financing activities in 2019 from cash used in financing activities in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in our net borrowings in 2019.\nWe maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC by meeting certain requirements. As a REIT, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income; however, the income realized by our TRSs in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate income tax rates. In addition, the income we receive from our hotels in Canada and Puerto Rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Capital Resources\nVarious percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as FF&E reserves to fund future capital improvements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our hotel managers and tenants deposited $73,189 into these accounts and spent $208,241 from the FF&E reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels. As of December 31, 2019, there was $53,626 on deposit in these escrow accounts, which was held directly by us and is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash.\nOur hotel operating agreements generally provide that, if necessary, we may provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed FF&E reserves or when no FF&E reserves are available. To the extent we make such additional fundings, our annual minimum returns or rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $242,571 for capital improvements in excess of FF&E reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels as follows:\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $51,056 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our then-existing Marriott agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

We currently expect to fund approximately $80,000 of this amount during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Under our amended agreement with Sonesta, FF&E deposits are required only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns.

We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 during 2020 for capital improvements under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net lease portfolio leases do not require FF&E escrow deposits. However, tenants under these leases are required to maintain the leased properties, including structural and non-structural components. Tenants under certain of our net lease portfolio leases, including TA, may request that we purchase qualifying capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases or we may agree to provide allowances for tenant improvements upon execution of new leases or when renewing our existing tenants. We funded $2,295 of capital improvements at certain of our net lease properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 of capital improvements under these leases during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Certain tenants are not obligated to request and we are not obligated to purchase any such improvements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $5,346 of unspent leasing-related obligations under our net lease portfolio.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling $353,619 using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. On January 16, 2020, we declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common share, or approximately $88,864, to shareholders of record on January 27, 2020. We paid this distribution on February 20, 2020 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding our distributions, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2019, in a series of transactions, we sold 20 travel centers in 15 states to TA for $308,200. We used a portion of the proceeds from these sales to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes, including hotel acquisitions.\nOn July 1, 2019, we sold all the shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. that we owned in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $40.00 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement among us, RMR Inc., certain other REITs managed by RMR LLC that also sold their class A common stock of RMR Inc. in the offering and the underwriters named therein. We received net proceeds of $93,892 from this sale, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and after other offering expenses, which we used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding the sale of our shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc., see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn September 18, 2019, we issued $825,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.350% unsecured senior notes due 2024, $450,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.750% unsecured senior notes due 2026 and $425,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.950% unsecured senior notes due 2029. We used the aggregate net proceeds from these offerings of $1,680,461, after underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, to finance a portion of the SMTA Transaction.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet. The aggregate transaction value of the SMTA Transaction was $2,482,382, including $2,384,577 in cash consideration, $82,069 of prepayment penalties to extinguish mortgage debt on the portfolio and $15,736 of other capitalized acquisition costs. The properties included in the portfolio are net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands that include quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states. We financed the SMTA Transaction with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with cash on hand, including net proceeds from our public offerings of senior unsecured notes, as further described above.\nDuring 2019, we acquired three hotels with 794 rooms for an aggregate purchase price of $226,450, excluding capitalized acquisition costs of $3,087 using proceeds from certain dispositions, cash on hand or outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring 2019, we sold 130 net lease properties with 2.8 million square feet for aggregate proceeds of $513,012, excluding closing costs of $3,402. We used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2019, we had 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 classified as held for sale.\nIn February 2020, we entered an agreement to acquire three net lease properties with approximately 6,696 square feet in two states with leases requiring an aggregate of $387 of annual minimum rents for an aggregate sales price of $7,000, excluding closing costs, using existing cash balances.\nSince January 1, 2020, we sold four vacant net lease properties with approximately 160,434 square feet in three states for an aggregate sales price of $5,010, excluding closing costs. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have also commenced marketing certain hotels as part of our previously announced plan to sell approximately $300,000 of hotels to reduce our financial leverage. We expect to sell the 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham and have agreed to sell or rebrand 33 hotels as part of the Marriott Agreement. We also expect to sell, rebrand or repurpose 39 hotels currently managed by Sonesta. We expect to use the proceeds from any sales of these hotels to repay debt or for general business purposes.\nWe currently intend to continue to expand our investments by primarily acquiring additional hotels and other single tenant, net lease properties and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of RMR LLC to locate, acquire and manage such properties. One of our goals in acquiring single tenant, net lease properties is to further diversify our sources of rents and returns with the intention of improving the security of our cash flows. Another of our goals is to purchase properties that produce rents, less property operating expenses, that are greater than our capital costs to acquire the properties and, accordingly, allow us to increase distributions to our shareholders over time. We expect that most of our acquisition efforts will focus on hotel and net lease properties; however, we may consider acquiring other types of properties.\nIn order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility and $400,000 term loan which are governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is July 15, 2022, and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, we have an option to extend the maturity date of this facility for two additional six month periods. We are required to pay interest at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 120 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019, on the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also have to pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 25 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.80%. As of December 31, 2019, we had $377,000 outstanding and $623,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of February 27, 2020, we had $437,000 outstanding and $563,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nOur $400,000 term loan, which matures on July 15, 2023, is prepayable without penalty at any time. We are required to pay interest on the amount outstanding under our term loan at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 135 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our term loan was 3.04%.\nOur credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased to up to $2,300,000 on a combined basis in certain circumstances.\nOur term debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility and term loan) as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNone of our unsecured debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates.\nWe currently expect to use cash on hand, the cash flows from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from any asset sales and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund our future debt maturities, operations, capital expenditures, distributions to our shareholders, property acquisitions and other general business purposes.\nWhen significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility, or the maturities of our indebtedness approach, we currently expect to explore refinancing alternatives. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt, issuing new equity securities and the sale of properties. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. We may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. Although we have not historically done so, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire or obtain mortgage financing on our existing properties.\nWhile we believe we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or other types of financings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nOur ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,127,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,277,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,775,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Security deposits (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital improvements (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected interest expense (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,448,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,090,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,541,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,319,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>14 of our hotels and 17 of our net lease properties are on land leased partially or in its entirety.

Our publicly issued term debt is governed by our indentures and related supplements. These indentures and related supplements and our credit agreement contain covenants that generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, and require us to maintain various financial ratios and our credit agreement restricts our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. Our credit agreement and our unsecured senior notes, indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager. As of December 31, 2019, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement.\nNeither our indentures and their supplements nor our credit agreement contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by a change in our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement, our highest senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if that debt rating is downgraded, our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility and term loan would increase.\nOur public debt indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debt of $20,000 or more ($50,000 or more in the case of our indenture entered into in February 2016 and its supplements). Similarly, our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $75,000 or more.\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR LLC, RMR Inc., TA and Sonesta and others related to them. For example: we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC; Adam Portnoy, the Chair of our Board of Trustees and one of our Managing Trustees, is the sole trustee, an officer and the controlling shareholder of ABP Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., a managing director, president and chief executive officer of RMR Inc., an officer and employee of RMR LLC, the chair of the board of directors and a managing director of TA, and, together with certain of his affiliates, a majority owner and director of Sonesta; John Murray, our other Managing Trustee and our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as an executive officer of RMR LLC and a director of Sonesta; and, until July 1, 2019, we owned shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. We also have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and which may have trustees, directors and officers who are also trustees, directors or officers of us, RMR LLC or RMR Inc., including: TA, which is our former subsidiary and largest tenant and of which we are the largest shareholder; and Sonesta, which is one of our hotel managers and is owned in part by Adam Portnoy and of which we own an approximately 34% equity interest.\nFor further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 4, 5, 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference and our other filings with the SEC, including our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or our definitive Proxy Statement, to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. For further information about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC and our various agreements with TA and Sonesta, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates have been and will be consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>variable interest entities, or VIEs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate, intangible assets and equity investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>classification of leases and the related impact to our financial statements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have determined that each of our wholly owned TRSs is a VIE, as defined under the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification\u2122, or the Codification. We have concluded that we must consolidate each of our wholly owned TRSs because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such VIE's performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each VIE, with the primary focus on losses, and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each VIE.\nWe allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land, buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their relative fair values and each component generally has a different useful life. For acquired real estate, we record building, land, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and, if applicable, the value of acquired in-place leases, the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value. For transactions that qualify as business combinations we allocate the excess, if any, of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill. We base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and, under some circumstances, studies from independent real estate appraisers to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, our management is ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives.\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 12 years for personal property. We amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract. We do not depreciate the allocated cost of land. Purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates. Incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods.\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators. These indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability, cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value.\nWe test our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. An impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value.\nWe periodically evaluate our equity method investments for possible indicators of other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. These indicators may include the length of time and degree to which the market value of our investment is below our cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, our intent and ability to be a long term holder of the investment and other considerations. If the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, we may record an impairment charge to adjust the basis of the investment to its fair value.\nWe determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques. These analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate, fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nCertain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a finance or operating lease. The classification of a lease as finance, sales-type, direct financing or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property, appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. See Note 2 to consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the impact to our accounting for leases due to recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification. Under this Topic, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the IRC and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. Despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are subject to income tax in Canada, Puerto Rico and in certain states. Further, we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated tax return and are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (or benefit) includes the income tax provision (or benefit) related to the operations of the TRSs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The Income Taxes Topic also prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not\u201d that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the more likely than not\u201d standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Tax returns filed for the 2016 through 2019 tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense.\nThese accounting policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience and the experience of our management and our Board of Trustees, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us, and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate. In the future, we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\nManagement Agreements, Leases and Operating Statistics (dollar amounts in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned and managed a diverse portfolio of hotels and net lease properties across the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada with 151 brands across 24 industries.\nHotel Portfolio\nAs of January 1, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) were included in six portfolio agreements and managed by or leased to separate affiliates of IHG, Marriott, Sonesta, Hyatt, Radisson and Wyndham.\nThe table and related notes below through page 76 summarize significant terms of our hotel lease and management agreements as of December 31, 2019. These tables also include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our hotel managers and tenant. These statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for our hotel properties. We consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables and related notes on the following pages to be important measures of our managers' and tenant's success in operating our hotel properties and their ability to continue to pay us. However, this third party reported information is not a direct measure of our financial performance and we have not independently verified the operating data.\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nRooms or\nSuites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nMinimum\nReturn/Rent (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rent / Return Coverage (3),\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Agreement\nReference Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHG (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.05x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marriott (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sonesta (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,963,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.67x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hyatt (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Radisson (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wyndham (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.56x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal / Average Hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,009,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.97x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the historical cost of our hotel properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any, and excludes capital improvements made from FF&E reserves funded from hotel operations that do not result in increases in hotel minimum returns or rents.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Each of our hotel management agreements or lease provides for payment to us of an annual minimum return or rent, respectively.

Future inflation might have both positive and negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our assets to increase. In periods of rapid U.S. inflation, our managers' and tenants' operating expenses may increase faster than their revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents and the security features, such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents are exhausted. To mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of, and our expected benefit from, these agreements and upon possible requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nGenerally, we do not expect inflation to have a material adverse impact on our financial results for the next 12 months or for the currently foreseeable future thereafter.\nSeasonality\nOur hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters. Most of our management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return and rent payments to us in equal amounts throughout the year. So long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties, seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flows from these properties. If and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum returns and rents due to us are exhausted or expire, our financial results may begin to reflect more of the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate. The return payments to us under certain of our management agreements depend exclusively upon earnings at these properties and, accordingly, our income and cash flows from these properties reflect the seasonality of the hotel industry.\nImpact of Climate Change\nConcerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our properties to increase. We do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations, because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or managers directly or in the longer term, passed through and paid by customers of our properties. Although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future, laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or managers and their ability to pay rent or returns to us.\nWe are environmentally conscious and aware of the impact our properties have on the environment. We and our tenants and managers have implemented numerous initiatives to encourage recycling of plastics, paper and metal or glass containers; we have programs to encourage reduced water and energy use at a hotel guest's option by not laundering towels and linens every day. When we renovate our hotels we generally use energy efficient products including but not limited to lighting, windows and HVAC equipment and many of the appliances in our extended stay hotels are Energy Star rated. We or our tenants or managers have also installed car battery charging stations at some of the properties in our portfolio to accommodate environmentally aware customers.\nIn an effort to reduce the effects of any increased energy costs in the future, we continuously study ways to improve the energy efficiency at all of our properties. Our property manager, RMR LLC, is a member of the Energy Star program, a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy that is focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Energy Star\u201d partner program, and a member of the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED\u00ae, green building program.\nSome observers believe severe weather in different parts of the world over the last few years is evidence of global climate change. Severe weather may have an adverse effect on certain properties we own. Rising sea levels could cause flooding at some of our properties, which may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own. We mitigate these risks by procuring, or requiring our managers or tenants to procure, insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses resulting from the consequences of losses caused by climate change. However, we cannot be sure that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that future storms, rising sea levels or other changes that may occur due to future climate change could not have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d within the meaning of applicable SEC rules, including funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated statements of income. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nWe calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, less any unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the item shown below and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our dividend yield and the dividend yield of other REITs, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nOur calculations of FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and reconciliations of net income available for common shareholders, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements, to those amounts appear in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (Less):\n</td> <td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>428,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Gain on sale of real estate (1)\n</td> <td>(159,535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loss on asset impairment (2)\n</td> <td>39,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized losses on equity securities (3)\n</td> <td>40,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>608,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>581,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (Less):\n</td> <td>Acquisition and transaction related costs (4)\n</td> <td>1,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt (5)\n</td> <td>8,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loss contingency (6)\n</td> <td>1,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Excess of liquidation preference over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed (7)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Deferred tax benefit (8)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,431\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Normalized FFO available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>620,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding (basic)\n</td> <td>164,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) (9)\n</td> <td>164,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted per common share amounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net income available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>FFO available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Normalized FFO available for common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Distributions declared per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate during the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers.

The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of, and our expected benefit from, these agreements and upon possible requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nRooms or\nSuites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nMinimum\nReturn/Rent (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rent / Return Coverage (3),\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Agreement\nReference Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nProperties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHG (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.05x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marriott (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,859,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.06x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sonesta (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,963,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.67x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hyatt (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.04x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Radisson (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.11x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wyndham (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.56x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal / Average Hotels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,009,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.97x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\nRental income - hotels. The decrease in rental income - hotels is primarily the result of a previously deferred gain from a historical lease default becoming fully amortized in 2018 ($3,631), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($2,812) and amending the lease terms for 48 vacation units we lease at one hotel during 2019 ($1,265), partially offset by contractual rent increases under certain of our hotel leases ($49). We reduced rental income by $985 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $382 in the 2018 period to record rent on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2018 includes $147 of percentage rental income. No percentage rent was earned under our hotel leases in 2019.\nTable 329: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cumulative % of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized Minimum\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized Minimum\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Minimum\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rent Expiring (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rent Expiring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rent Expiring\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>655,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>905,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>694,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,603,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,146,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,326,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,131,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,539,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization - hotels.

In 2019, the U.S. hotel industry generally realized increases in ADR and RevPAR and no change in occupancy compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018 produced aggregate year over year decreases in ADR and RevPAR and a decline in occupancy. We believe these results are, in part, due to the disruption and displacement at certain of our hotels undergoing renovations, increased competition from new hotel room supply in certain markets and decreased business activity in areas where some of our hotels are located.\nIn an effort to reduce the effects of any increased energy costs in the future, we continuously study ways to improve the energy efficiency at all of our properties. Our property manager, RMR LLC, is a member of the Energy Star program, a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy that is focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Energy Star\u201d partner program, and a member of the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED\u00ae, green building program.\nRental income net lease portfolio. The decrease in rental income - net lease portfolio is a result of the sale of 20 travel centers to TA and our lease amendments with TA in January 2019 ($47,628), partially offset by rents related to properties acquired pursuant to the SMTA Transaction ($46,717). See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these transactions. We reduced rental income by $9,734 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $12,127 in the 2018 period to record scheduled rent increases under certain leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our TA leases and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2019 and 2018 includes $4,238 and $3,548, respectively, of percentage rental income.\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

preferred shares at the stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption (an aggregate of $291,435). The liquidation preference of the redeemed shares exceeded the carrying amount for the redeemed shares as of the date of redemption by$9,893 and we reduced net income available for common shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2017 by that excess amount. \nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet. The aggregate transaction value of the SMTA Transaction was $2,482,382, including $2,384,577 in cash consideration, $82,069 of prepayment penalties to extinguish mortgage debt on the portfolio and $15,736 of other capitalized acquisition costs. The properties included in the portfolio are net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands that include quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states. We financed the SMTA Transaction with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with cash on hand, including net proceeds from our public offerings of senior unsecured notes, as further described above.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of operating expenses, funding the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return and reimbursement to Radisson of working capital and guaranty advances, if any. This additional return is not guaranteed.\n (8) Other includes 184 tenants with an average investment of $7,558 and average annual minimum rent of $509. \n \u2022 variable interest entities, or VIEs;

We funded $2,295 of capital improvements at certain of our net lease properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 of capital improvements under these leases during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Unrealized losses on equity securities represent the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of our investments in RMR Inc., which we sold in July 2019, and TA common shares to their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, which we historically referred to as our Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing January 1, 2020, or the Marriott Agreement. The Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements included 122 hotels, provided for aggregate annual minimum returns and rents due to us of $192,774 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2019, respectively. The previously available guarantee under the Marriott No. 234 agreement of $30,672 expired on December 31, 2019. The then existing security deposit held by us for the Marriott No. 234 agreement ($33,445 as of December 31, 2019) will continue to secure payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us under the Marriott Agreement and may be replenished up to the security deposit cap of $64,700 from 60% of the cash flows realized from operations of the 122 hotels after payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us, Marriott's base management fees and certain other advances by us or Marriott, if any. Marriott provided a new $30.0 million limited guaranty for 85% of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us through 2026 under the Marriott Agreement if the security deposit is exhausted. Under the Marriott Agreement, we agreed to fund approximately $400,000 for capital improvements at certain hotels over a four year period.

our properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a finance or operating lease. The classification of a lease as finance, sales-type, direct financing or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property, appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. See Note 2 to consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the impact to our accounting for leases due to recent accounting pronouncements.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 80% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, management fees to Sonesta, our minimum return, an imputed FF&E reserve to us and reimbursement of operating loss or working capital advances, if any.\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Brand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>No. of Buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\nMinimum Rent (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Annualized\nMinimum Rent (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coverage (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>TravelCenters of America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,281,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.02x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Petro Stopping Centers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,021,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.70x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>AMC Theatres\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.33x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>The Great Escape\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.13x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.\n</td> <td>Life Time Fitness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.56x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.\n</td> <td>Casual Male\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.22x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.\n</td> <td>Buehler's Fresh Foods\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.09x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8.\n</td> <td>Heartland Dental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.72x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9.\n</td> <td>Pizza Hut\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.35x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10.\n</td> <td>Regal Cinemas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.84x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11.\n</td> <td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,345,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.47x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,276,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.32x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 18, 2019, we issued $825,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.350% unsecured senior notes due 2024, $450,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.750% unsecured senior notes due 2026 and $425,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.950% unsecured senior notes due 2029. We used the aggregate net proceeds from these offerings of $1,680,461, after underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, to finance a portion of the SMTA Transaction.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of operating expenses, funding the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return and reimbursement to Hyatt of working capital and guaranty advances, if any. This additional return is not guaranteed.\nOur hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters. Most of our management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return and rent payments to us in equal amounts throughout the year. So long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties, seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flows from these properties. If and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum returns and rents due to us are exhausted or expire, our financial results may begin to reflect more of the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate. The return payments to us under certain of our management agreements depend exclusively upon earnings at these properties and, accordingly, our income and cash flows from these properties reflect the seasonality of the hotel industry.\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense is due to higher average outstanding borrowings, primarily as a result of our financing of the SMTA Transaction, and a higher weighted average interest rate in 2019.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our net lease properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nWe present certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d within the meaning of applicable SEC rules, including funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated statements of income. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.\nOur Operating Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $5,346 of unspent leasing-related obligations under our net lease portfolio.\nWe determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques. These analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate, fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nGain on sale of real estate. We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate in 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers.\nWhen significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility, or the maturities of our indebtedness approach, we currently expect to explore refinancing alternatives. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt, issuing new equity securities and the sale of properties. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. We may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. Although we have not historically done so, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire or obtain mortgage financing on our existing properties.\nHotel Portfolio\n (6) As of December 31, 2019, we leased our 53 Sonesta branded hotels (seven Royal Sonesta\u00ae Hotels, seven Sonesta Hotels & Resorts\u00ae and 39 Sonesta ES Suites\u00ae hotels) in 26 states to one of our TRSs. The management agreements for two hotels expire on December 31, 2020 and includes automatic one year renewals. The management agreement for the remaining 51 hotels expires in 2037. Sonesta has two renewal options for 15 years each for all, but not less than all, of these 51 hotels.  As of December 31, 2019, we e have no security deposit or guaranty from Sonesta. Accordingly, payment by Sonesta of the minimum return due to us under this management agreement is limited to the hotels' available cash flows after the payment of operating expenses, including certain management fees, and we are financially responsible for operating cash flows deficits, if any.\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss of $8,451 on early extinguishment of debt in 2019 resulting from the termination of a term loan commitment we arranged in connection with the SMTA Transaction. We recorded a loss of $160 on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility and term loan.\nOverview (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts and per room hotel data)\nFF&E Reserve income. FF&E reserve income represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures. The terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels. We do not report the amounts, if any, which are escrowed as FF&E reserves for our managed hotels as FF&E reserve income. The decrease in FF&E reserve income is the result of decreased sales at certain of our leased hotels in 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification. Under this Topic, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the IRC and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. Despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are subject to income tax in Canada, Puerto Rico and in certain states. Further, we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated tax return and are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (or benefit) includes the income tax provision (or benefit) related to the operations of the TRSs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The Income Taxes Topic also prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not\u201d that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the more likely than not\u201d standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Tax returns filed for the 2016 through 2019 tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense.\n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that up to 5% of the gross revenues of each of our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta will be escrowed for future capital expenditures as FF&E reserves,\u201d subject to available cash flow after payment of the annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement; \n (1) We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate during the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers. We recorded a $9,348 gain on sale of real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the sales of three hotels. \nDepreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio. The increase in depreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio is a result of the net lease properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction ($32,023) and the depreciation and amortization of travel center improvements we purchased since January 1, 2018 ($438), partially offset by our travel center dispositions since January 1, 2018 ($11,175) and certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2018 ($8,244).\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $19,034 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our Radisson agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently do not expect to fund any capital improvements under this agreement in 2020. As we fund improvements in the future, the contractual minimum returns payable to us will increase. \n \u2022 Sonesta will continue to manage 14 of our full-service hotels and the aggregate annual minimum returns due for these hotels was reduced from $99,013 to $69,013; \nMany of our operating agreements contain security features, such as guarantees and security deposits, which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our agreements regardless of property performance. However, the effectiveness of various security features to provide us uninterrupted receipt of minimum returns and rents is not assured, especially if economic conditions generally decline for a prolonged period. Also, certain of the guarantees that we hold are limited in amount and duration and do not provide for payment of the entire amount of the applicable minimum returns.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned and managed a diverse portfolio of hotels and net lease properties across the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada with 151 brands across 24 industries.\nRelated Person Transactions\n\nOur ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities.\nWe currently expect to use cash on hand, the cash flows from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from any asset sales and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund our future debt maturities, operations, capital expenditures, distributions to our shareholders, property acquisitions and other general business purposes.\n (5) We recorded a loss of $8,451 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the termination of a term loan commitment we arranged in connection with the SMTA Transaction. We recorded losses of $160 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility and term loan and $146 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the redemption of certain senior unsecured notes. \n (2) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \nOur calculations of FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and reconciliations of net income available for common shareholders, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements, to those amounts appear in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).\n (9) Represents weighted average common shares adjusted to reflect the potential dilution of unvested share awards. \n (3) We define hotel coverage as combined total hotel property level revenues minus all hotel property level expenses and FF&E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to hotel minimum returns or rents due to us (which data is provided to us by our managers or tenant), divided by the minimum returns or rents due to us. Coverage amounts for our IHG, Sonesta and Radisson agreements include data for periods prior to our ownership of certain hotel properties. Coverage amounts for our Sonesta agreement include data for three hotels prior to when these hotels were managed by Sonesta. \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that (1) our termination rights under those agreements for our 14 full service hotels managed by Sonesta are generally limited to performance and for cause,\u201d casualty and condemnation events, (2) a portfolio wide performance test now applies for determining whether the management agreement for any of our full-service hotels managed by Sonesta may be terminated for performance reasons, and (3) the provisions included in our historical pooling agreement that allowed either us or Sonesta to require the marketing for sale of non-economic hotels were removed; and \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that up to 5% of the gross revenues of each of our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta will be escrowed for future capital expenditures as FF&E reserves,\u201d subject to available cash flow after payment of the annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement; \nIn January 2019, in a series of transactions, we sold 20 travel centers in 15 states to TA for $308,200. We used a portion of the proceeds from these sales to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes, including hotel acquisitions.\n \u2022 classification of leases and the related impact to our financial statements; and \nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for an annual additional return payment to us of $12,067 from the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, funding of the required FF&E reserve, if any, payment of our minimum return, payment of certain management fees and replenishment and expansion of the security deposit. In addition, the agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment to us of the annual additional return amount. These additional return amounts are not guaranteed or secured by the security deposit we hold.\n \u2022 Previously, our Wyndham agreement required FF&E escrow deposits only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns. No FF&E escrow deposits were required during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $3,040 for capital improvements to certain hotels included in our Wyndham agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 during 2020 for capital improvements under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. \n (1) 14 of our hotels and 17 of our net lease properties are on land leased partially or in its entirety. In each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us. Pursuant to the terms of our management agreements and leases, payments of ground lease obligations are generally made by our managers or tenants. However, if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease, we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center. We have included the future rent expense under these ground leases in the table above. \nWe test our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. An impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nComparable hotels data. We present RevPAR, average daily rate, or ADR, and occupancy for the periods presented on a comparable basis to facilitate comparisons between periods. We generally define comparable hotels as those that were owned by us and were open and operating for the entire periods being compared. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we excluded 10 hotels from our comparable results. Six of these hotels were not owned for the entire periods and four were closed for major renovations during part of the periods presented.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\n (6) TA is our largest tenant. We lease 179 travel centers (134 under the TravelCenters of America brand and 45 under the Petro Stopping Centers brand) to a subsidiary of TA under master leases that expire in 2029, 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2035, respectively. TA has two renewal options for 15 years each for all of the travel centers. In addition to the payment of our minimum rent, the TA leases provide for payment to us of percentage rent based on increases in total non-fuel revenues over base levels (3% of non-fuel revenues above threshold amounts defined in the agreements). Commencing in 2020, these leases provide for payment of an additional half percent (0.5%) of non-fuel revenues above 2019 non-fuel base revenues. TA's remaining deferred rent obligation of $57,247 as of December 31, 2019 is being paid in quarterly installments of $4,404 through January 31, 2023. \nManagement agreements and leases. At February 26, 2020, we owned 329 hotels operated under six agreements. We leased 328 of these hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that are managed by hotel operating companies and one is leased to a hotel operating company. We own 816 service-oriented properties with 194 tenants subject to triple net\u201d leases, where the tenants are generally responsible for payment of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our consolidated statements of comprehensive income include hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses of our managed hotels and rental income and other operating expenses from our leased hotels and net lease properties.\n\nWe define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total hotel property level revenues minus all hotel property level expenses and FF&E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us divided by the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us. More detail regarding coverage, guarantees and other features of our hotel operating agreements is presented in the tables and related notes on pages 74 through 76. For the year ended December 31, 2019, five of our six hotel operating agreements, representing 42.5% of our total annual minimum returns and minimum rents, generated coverage of less than 1.0x (with a range of 0.50x to 0.93x).\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net lease tenants operated across more than 131 brands. The following table identifies the top ten brands based on annualized minimum rent.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale.  As of December 31, 2019, shown below is the list of our top ten states where our net lease properties were located. No other state represents more than 3% of our net lease annual minimum rents.\nAs of January 1, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) were included in six portfolio agreements and managed by or leased to separate affiliates of IHG, Marriott, Sonesta, Hyatt, Radisson and Wyndham.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded a $39,296 loss on asset impairment during 2019 to reduce the carrying value of 19 net lease properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and two hotels to their estimated fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our top ten net lease tenants based on annualized minimum rent are listed below.\n (1) Includes properties located in 34 states. \n \u2022 allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses; \n (4) See page 78 for our definition of coverage. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n (7) This property is held for sale as of December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $55,359 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our IHG agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently expect to fund approximately $15,000 for capital improvements under this agreement during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nFor further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 4, 5, 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference and our other filings with the SEC, including our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or our definitive Proxy Statement, to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. For further information about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC and our various agreements with TA and Sonesta, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services.\n \u2022 We extended the initial expiration date of the management agreements for our full-service hotels located in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA that are managed by Sonesta to expire in January 2037 to align with the initial expiration date for our other full-service hotels managed by Sonesta.  Except as described above, the economic terms of our amended and restated Sonesta agreement and amended and restated pooling agreement are consistent with the historical Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement.\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not fund capital improvements to any hotels operating under our Hyatt agreement. We currently expect to fund approximately $20,000 during 2020 for capital improvements to certain hotels under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in incentive business management fees paid to RMR LLC in 2019 with respect to 2018, and an increase in the minimum returns and rents paid to us as a result of our acquisitions and funding of improvements to certain properties since January 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in security deposits received or replenished in 2019 and higher interest payments in 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to our higher real estate acquisition activity in 2019 and an increase in our capital improvement fundings, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and a decrease in our hotel managers' purchases with FF&E reserves in 2018. The change to cash flows provided by financing activities in 2019 from cash used in financing activities in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in our net borrowings in 2019.\n (7) We lease our 22 Hyatt Place\u00ae branded hotels in 14 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Hyatt under a combination management agreement that expires in 2030; Hyatt has two renewal options for 15 years each for all, but not less than all, of the hotels.  We have a limited guaranty of $50,000 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available Hyatt guaranty was $19,655. The guaranty is limited in amount but does not expire in time and may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDuring 2019, we acquired three hotels with 794 rooms for an aggregate purchase price of $226,450, excluding capitalized acquisition costs of $3,087 using proceeds from certain dispositions, cash on hand or outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\n \u2022 Holdco issued to us a number of its shares of common stock representing approximately (but not more than) 34% of its outstanding shares of common stock (post-issuance); \nWe lease 48 vacation units in one of our Sonesta hotels to Destinations, under a lease that expires in on March 31, 2020 at which time Destinations will vacate the leased space.\nAs of February 26, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) are included in six combination portfolio agreements and all 329 hotels were managed by or leased to hotel operating companies. Our 816 net lease properties are leased to 194 tenants as of December 31, 2019. The costs of operating and maintaining our properties are generally paid by the hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account. Our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses and for returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and, to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and rents, from their separate resources. Our hotel managers and tenants include Marriott, IHG, Sonesta, Wyndham, Hyatt and Radisson. TA is our largest net lease tenant. No other net lease tenant represents more than 1% of our total annualized minimum returns or rents.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nAcquisition and transaction related costs. Acquisition and transaction related costs represent costs related to our exploration of possible financing transactions.\nWe periodically evaluate our equity method investments for possible indicators of other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. These indicators may include the length of time and degree to which the market value of our investment is below our cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, our intent and ability to be a long term holder of the investment and other considerations. If the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, we may record an impairment charge to adjust the basis of the investment to its fair value.\nOur debt obligations at December 31, 2019 consisted of outstanding borrowings under our $1,000,000 revolving credit facility, our $400,000 term loan and $5,350,000 of publicly issued term debt. Our publicly issued term debt is governed by our indentures and related supplements. These indentures and related supplements and our credit agreement contain covenants that generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, and require us to maintain various financial ratios and our credit agreement restricts our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. Our credit agreement and our unsecured senior notes, indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager. As of December 31, 2019, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement.\n \u2022 income taxes.  We have determined that each of our wholly owned TRSs is a VIE, as defined under the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification\u2122, or the Codification. We have concluded that we must consolidate each of our wholly owned TRSs because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such VIE's performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each VIE, with the primary focus on losses, and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each VIE.\n (4) Acquisition and transaction related costs represents costs related to our exploration of possible financing transactions. \nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. For a comparison of consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 please see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpact of Inflation\nHotel operating revenues. The increase in hotel operating revenues is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,364), increased revenues at certain of our managed hotels due to increases in ADR and higher occupancies ($49,888) and the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,427), partially offset by decreased revenues at certain of our managed hotels primarily as a result of lower occupancies ($44,167) and decreased revenues at certain of our other managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($32,937). Additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page 76.\n \u2022 We and Sonesta agreed to sell, rebrand or repurpose our 39 extended stay hotels currently managed by Sonesta with an aggregate carrying value of $480,547 and which currently require aggregate annual minimum returns of $49,467. As the hotels are sold, rebranded or repurposed, the management agreement for the applicable hotel(s) will terminate without our being required to pay Sonesta a termination fee and our annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement will decrease by the amount allocated to the applicable hotel(s); \nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta and Holdco pursuant to which we and Sonesta restructured our existing business arrangements, as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for all our 329 hotels, ADR decreased 1.5% to $128.76, occupancy decreased 0.9 percentage points to 72.5% and RevPAR decreased 2.7% to $93.35.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized higher state taxes during the 2019 period primarily due to an increase in the amount of state sourced income subject to income taxes.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR LLC, RMR Inc., TA and Sonesta and others related to them. For example: we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC; Adam Portnoy, the Chair of our Board of Trustees and one of our Managing Trustees, is the sole trustee, an officer and the controlling shareholder of ABP Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., a managing director, president and chief executive officer of RMR Inc., an officer and employee of RMR LLC, the chair of the board of directors and a managing director of TA, and, together with certain of his affiliates, a majority owner and director of Sonesta; John Murray, our other Managing Trustee and our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as an executive officer of RMR LLC and a director of Sonesta; and, until July 1, 2019, we owned shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. We also have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and which may have trustees, directors and officers who are also trustees, directors or officers of us, RMR LLC or RMR Inc., including: TA, which is our former subsidiary and largest tenant and of which we are the largest shareholder; and Sonesta, which is one of our hotel managers and is owned in part by Adam Portnoy and of which we own an approximately 34% equity interest.\n \u2022 assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate, intangible assets and equity investments; \nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates have been and will be consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nDuring 2019, we sold 130 net lease properties with 2.8 million square feet for aggregate proceeds of $513,012, excluding closing costs of $3,402. We used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2019, we had 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 classified as held for sale.\nInterest income. The increase in interest income is due to higher average cash and restricted cash balances during 2019.\n (4) See page 78 for our definition of coverage. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that (1) our termination rights under those agreements for our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta are generally limited to performance and for cause\u201d, casualty and condemnation events, (2) a portfolio wide performance test now applies for determining whether the management agreement for any of our full service hotels managed by Sonesta may be terminated for performance reasons, and (3) the provisions included in our historical pooling agreement that allowed either us or Sonesta to require the marketing for sale of non-economic hotels were removed; and \nIn addition to our minimum return, this agreement provides for payment to us of 60% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, funding of the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return, payment of certain management fees and replenishment of the security deposit. This additional return amount is not guaranteed or secured by the security deposit.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the dividends we received from our former investment in RMR Inc.\n (1) Operating data includes data for certain hotels for periods prior to when we acquired them. \nAdditional details of our hotel operating agreements and net lease agreements are set forth in Notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the table and notes thereto on pages 74 through 76 below.\nDebt Covenants\nWe maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC by meeting certain requirements. As a REIT, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income; however, the income realized by our TRSs in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate income tax rates. In addition, the income we receive from our hotels in Canada and Puerto Rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nSome observers believe severe weather in different parts of the world over the last few years is evidence of global climate change. Severe weather may have an adverse effect on certain properties we own. Rising sea levels could cause flooding at some of our properties, which may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own. We mitigate these risks by procuring, or requiring our managers or tenants to procure, insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses resulting from the consequences of losses caused by climate change. However, we cannot be sure that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that future storms, rising sea levels or other changes that may occur due to future climate change could not have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018, ADR decreased 1.1% to $126.30, occupancy decreased 0.3 percentage points to 73.0% and RevPAR decreased 1.5% to $92.20.\n (8) We lease our nine Radisson branded hotels (four Radisson\u00ae Hotels & Resorts, four Country Inns & Suites\u00ae by Radisson and one Radisson Blu\u00ae hotel) in six states to one of our TRSs and these hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Radisson under a combination management agreement which expires in 2035 and Radisson has two 15 year renewal options for all, but not less than all, of the hotels.  We have a limited guaranty of $47,523 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available Radisson guaranty was $41,216. The guaranty is limited in amount but does not expire in time and may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return.\n (2) Represents the security deposit balance as of December 31, 2019. We may draw upon security deposits to cover any rent or return shortfalls thereby decreasing the potential obligation to repay some of these deposits. \nWe periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators. These indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability, cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value.\n\n (5) On December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, historically referred to as our Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing January 1, 2020. The Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements included 122 hotels, provided for aggregate annual minimum returns and rents due to us of $192,774 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2019, respectively. As of January 1, 2020, we leased our 122 Marriott branded hotels (two full service Marriott\u00ae, 35 Residence Inn by Marriott\u00ae, 71 Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae, 12 TownePlace Suites by Marriott\u00ae and two SpringHill Suites by Marriott\u00ae hotels) in 31 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels under the Marriott agreement are managed by subsidiaries of Marriott and require aggregate annual minimum returns of $190,573. The Marriott Agreement is scheduled to expire in 2035 and Marriott has two renewal options for 10 years each for all, but not less than all, of the hotels. \nWhile we believe we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or other types of financings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our net lease properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nIn February 2020, we entered an agreement to acquire three net lease properties with approximately 6,696 square feet in two states with leases requiring an aggregate of $387 of annual minimum rents for an aggregate sales price of $7,000, excluding closing costs, using existing cash balances.\nAs of December 31, 2019, lease expirations at our net lease properties by year are as follows. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n (9) We lease our 20 Wyndham branded hotels (four Wyndham Hotels and Resorts\u00ae and 16 Hawthorn Suites\u00ae hotels) in 13 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Wyndham under a combination management agreement which expires on September 30, 2020. We have no guarantee or security deposit from Wyndham. Payment by Wyndham is limited to the available cash flows after payment of operating expenses. Wyndham is not entitled to any base management fees for the remainder of the agreement.  The following tables summarize the operating statistics, including ADR, occupancy and RevPAR reported to us by our hotel managers or tenants by management agreement or lease for the periods indicated. All operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our hotel managers and tenants for the indicated periods. We have not independently verified our managers' or tenants' operating data.\n \u2022 Previously, our Sonesta agreement did not require FF&E escrow deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $114,082 for capital improvements to certain hotels included in our Sonesta agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Under our amended agreement with Sonesta, FF&E deposits are required only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns. We currently expect to fund approximately $30,000 during 2020 for capital improvements under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \n (3) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent, respectively. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \n (4) We define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve months period reported based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating information furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. Properties for which tenants do not report operating information are excluded from the coverage calculations. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n (2) Each of our hotel management agreements or lease provides for payment to us of an annual minimum return or rent, respectively. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees or security deposits as more fully described below. In addition, certain of our hotel management agreements provide for payment to us of additional amounts to the extent of available cash flows as defined in the management agreement. Payments of these additional amounts are not guaranteed or secured by deposits. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments necessary to record rent on a straight line basis. \nThese accounting policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience and the experience of our management and our Board of Trustees, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us, and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate. In the future, we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\n (4) Projected interest expense is interest attributable to only debt obligations listed above at existing rates as of December 31, 2019 and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments, additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, new debt issuances or changes in interest rates.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEquity in earnings of an investee. Equity in earnings of an investee represents our proportionate share of the earnings of Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC.\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $51,056 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our then-existing Marriott agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Under the Marriott Agreement, we agreed to fund approximately $400,000 for capital improvements at certain hotels over a four year period. We currently expect to fund approximately $80,000 of this amount during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nOther operating expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is a result of operating expenses we pay at certain properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction in 2019.\nOur credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased to up to $2,300,000 on a combined basis in certain circumstances.\nNet income. Our net income, net income per common share (basic and diluted) each increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above.\nConcerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our properties to increase. We do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations, because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or managers directly or in the longer term, passed through and paid by customers of our properties. Although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future, laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or managers and their ability to pay rent or returns to us.\nWe currently intend to continue to expand our investments by primarily acquiring additional hotels and other single tenant, net lease properties and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of RMR LLC to locate, acquire and manage such properties. One of our goals in acquiring single tenant, net lease properties is to further diversify our sources of rents and returns with the intention of improving the security of our cash flows. Another of our goals is to purchase properties that produce rents, less property operating expenses, that are greater than our capital costs to acquire the properties and, accordingly, allow us to increase distributions to our shareholders over time. We expect that most of our acquisition efforts will focus on hotel and net lease properties; however, we may consider acquiring other types of properties.\nImpact of Climate Change\n (2) We recorded a $39,296 loss on asset impairment during the three months ended December 31, 2019 to reduce the carrying value of 19 net lease properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and two hotels to their estimated fair value. \nOur $400,000 term loan, which matures on July 15, 2023, is prepayable without penalty at any time. We are required to pay interest on the amount outstanding under our term loan at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 135 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our term loan was 3.04%.\nOur principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to our shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels, minimum rents from our leased hotel and net lease portfolio and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We receive minimum returns and rents from our managers and tenants monthly. We may receive additional returns, percentage rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions, if any, either monthly or quarterly, and these amounts are usually subject to annual reconciliations. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. However, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our managers and tenants may become unable or unwilling to pay minimum returns and rents to us when due, and, as a result, our cash flows and net income would decline and we may need to reduce the amount of, or even eliminate, our distributions to common shareholders.\n (3) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n (5) Leases subject to full or partial corporate guarantee. \nWe calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, less any unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the item shown below and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our dividend yield and the dividend yield of other REITs, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nWhen cash flows from our hotels under certain of our agreements are less than the minimum returns or rents contractually due to us, we have utilized the applicable security features in our agreements to cover some of these shortfalls. However, several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts, are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire, especially if our hotel renovation and rebranding activities do not result in improved operating results at these hotels. Accordingly, the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured. If any of our hotel managers, tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us, our cash flows will decline and we may become unable to continue to pay distributions to our shareholders or the amount of the distributions may decline.\n (3) Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, net represent the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of our investments in RMR Inc. and TA common shares to their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We sold our shares of RMR Inc. on July 1, 2019. \nOur Managers and Tenants\nGenerally, we do not expect inflation to have a material adverse impact on our financial results for the next 12 months or for the currently foreseeable future thereafter.\nCertain of our management arrangements or leases are subject to full or limited guarantees or are secured by a security deposit which we control. These guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us. Some of our managers and tenants, or their affiliates, may also supplement cash flows from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees or security deposits. Guarantee payments, security deposit applications or supplemental payments to us, if any, made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations, but, under some of our agreements, the manager or tenant may recover these guarantee or supplemental payments and the security deposits may be replenished from subsequent cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and rents are paid.\nSince January 1, 2020, we sold four vacant net lease properties with approximately 160,434 square feet in three states for an aggregate sales price of $5,010, excluding closing costs. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have also commenced marketing certain hotels as part of our previously announced plan to sell approximately $300,000 of hotels to reduce our financial leverage. We expect to sell the 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham and have agreed to sell or rebrand 33 hotels as part of the Marriott Agreement. We also expect to sell, rebrand or repurpose 39 hotels currently managed by Sonesta. We expect to use the proceeds from any sales of these hotels to repay debt or for general business purposes.\nNeither our indentures and their supplements nor our credit agreement contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by a change in our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement, our highest senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if that debt rating is downgraded, our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility and term loan would increase.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet for an aggregate transaction value of $2,482,382. The portfolio consisted of 767 service-oriented retail properties net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands including quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states.\nIn order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility and $400,000 term loan which are governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is July 15, 2022, and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, we have an option to extend the maturity date of this facility for two additional six month periods. We are required to pay interest at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 120 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019, on the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also have to pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 25 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.80%. As of December 31, 2019, we had $377,000 outstanding and $623,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of February 27, 2020, we had $437,000 outstanding and $563,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net lease properties were 98% occupied and we had 17 properties available for lease. During 2019 we entered into lease renewals for 217,807 rentable square feet at weighted (by rentable square feet) average rents that were 0.75% below prior rents for the same space. The weighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term for these leases was 8.1 years and leasing concessions and capital commitments for these leases were $551, or $0.31 per square foot, per lease year.\n (2) Operating data includes data for three hotels prior to when these hotels were managed by Sonesta. \nWe originally held a security deposit of $64,700 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available balance of this security deposit was $33,445. This security deposit may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return and certain management fees. Marriott has also provided us with a $30,000 limited guaranty to cover payment shortfalls up to 85% of our minimum return after the available security deposit balance has been depleted. This limited guaranty expires in 2026.\nThe table and related notes below through page 76 summarize significant terms of our hotel lease and management agreements as of December 31, 2019. These tables also include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our hotel managers and tenant. These statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for our hotel properties. We consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables and related notes on the following pages to be important measures of our managers' and tenant's success in operating our hotel properties and their ability to continue to pay us. However, this third party reported information is not a direct measure of our financial performance and we have not independently verified the operating data.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta pursuant to which we and Sonesta modified our existing business arrangements. Additional details regarding this transaction are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta and Holdco pursuant to which we and Sonesta restructured our business arrangements, as follows:\nVarious percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as FF&E reserves to fund future capital improvements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our hotel managers and tenants deposited $73,189 into these accounts and spent $208,241 from the FF&E reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels. As of December 31, 2019, there was $53,626 on deposit in these escrow accounts, which was held directly by us and is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash.\n \u2022 We extended the initial expiration date of the management agreements for our full-service hotels located in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA that are managed by Sonesta to expire in January 2037 to align with the initial expiration date for our other full-service hotels managed by Sonesta.  Except as described above, the economic terms of our amended and restated Sonesta agreement and amended and restated pooling agreement are consistent with the historical Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Item 9B. Other information and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 12 years for personal property. We amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract. We do not depreciate the allocated cost of land. Purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates. Incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nWe are a REIT organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 1,145 properties in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico.\nWe define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us, weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve month period based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating information furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. Properties for which tenants do not report operating information are excluded from the coverage calculations. As of December 31, 2019, our net lease properties generated coverage of 2.32x.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling $353,619 using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. On January 16, 2020, we declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common share, or approximately $88,864, to shareholders of record on January 27, 2020. We paid this distribution on February 20, 2020 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding our distributions, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe amended our agreement with Wyndham in 2019 whereby the term of the management agreement will expire on September 30, 2020 unless sooner terminated with respect to any of our Wyndham hotels that are sold or rebranded. We expect to sell the remaining 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham by that expiration date. Wyndham was previously paying us 85% of the annual minimum returns due under the management agreement. Under the amendment, Wyndham will pay to us all available cash flows of the hotels after payment of hotel operating expenses. Wyndham will not be entitled to any base management fees for the remainder of the agreement term.\n\nSeasonality\n (6) We recorded a $1,997 loss contingency during the three months ended December 31, 2019 for an expected settlement of a historical pension withdrawal liability for a hotel we rebranded. \nWe are environmentally conscious and aware of the impact our properties have on the environment. We and our tenants and managers have implemented numerous initiatives to encourage recycling of plastics, paper and metal or glass containers; we have programs to encourage reduced water and energy use at a hotel guest's option by not laundering towels and linens every day. When we renovate our hotels we generally use energy efficient products including but not limited to lighting, windows and HVAC equipment and many of the appliances in our extended stay hotels are Energy Star rated. We or our tenants or managers have also installed car battery charging stations at some of the properties in our portfolio to accommodate environmentally aware customers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Represents the historical cost of our hotel properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any, and excludes capital improvements made from FF&E reserves funded from hotel operations that do not result in increases in hotel minimum returns or rents. \n \u2022 Holdco issued to us a number of its shares of common stock representing approximately (but not more than) 34% of its outstanding share of common stock (post-issuance); \nChanges in our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows: (1) cash flows provided by operating activities increased from $596,953 in 2018 to $617,722 in 2019; (2) cash used in investing activities increased from $427,742 in 2018 to $2,130,044 in 2019; and (3) cash flows from financing activities changed from $190,704 of cash used by financing activities in 2018 to $1,517,578 of cash provided in financing activities in 2019.\nManagement Agreements, Leases and Operating Statistics (dollar amounts in thousands)\nWe are exiting our relationship with Wyndham. On November 1, 2019, we rebranded two full-service hotels previously managed by Wyndham in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA to the Sonesta brands. We also lease 48 vacation units in the Chicago, IL Sonesta hotel to a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (NYSE: WYND), or Destinations, which requires annual minimum rent of $1,537. We amended this lease so the term of the lease expires on March 31, 2020, at which time Destinations will vacate the leased space.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 816 net lease properties located in 44 states were leased to 194 tenants. These tenants operate in 23 distinct industries including travel centers, casual dining and quick service restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automobile service and others. TA is our largest tenant and leases 179 travel centers under five lease agreements that expire between 2029 and 2035 and require annual minimum rents of $246,088, which represents approximately 24.6% of our total minimum returns and rent as of December 31, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative costs is primarily due to a decrease in business management incentive fee expense ($53,635), partially offset by a loss contingency ($1,997) and increased business management fees ($1,665) in 2019.\n (2) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \nHotel operating expenses. The increase in hotel operating expenses is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,738), an increase in wage and benefit costs, sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs at certain of our managed hotels resulting primarily from higher occupancies and general expense increases ($31,216), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,642) and an increase in real estate taxes at certain of our hotels ($1,988), partially offset by operating expense decreases at certain managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($33,382), an increase in the amount of guaranty and security deposit utilization under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($24,331) and a decrease in the amount of guaranty and security deposit replenishment under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($10,009). Certain guarantees and security deposits which have been applied to past payment deficits may be replenished from a share of subsequent cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements. When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were increased by $734 and $10,743 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such replenishments. When our guarantees and security deposits are utilized to cover shortfalls of hotels' cash flows from the minimum payments due to us, we reflect such utilizations in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a decrease to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were decreased by $29,897 and $5,569 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such utilization.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott, which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, historically referred to as the Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing on January 1, 2020. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn July 1, 2019, we sold all the shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. that we owned in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $40.00 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement among us, RMR Inc., certain other REITs managed by RMR LLC that also sold their class A common stock of RMR Inc. in the offering and the underwriters named therein. We received net proceeds of $93,892 from this sale, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and after other offering expenses, which we used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding the sale of our shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc., see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land, buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their relative fair values and each component generally has a different useful life. For acquired real estate, we record building, land, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and, if applicable, the value of acquired in-place leases, the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value. For transactions that qualify as business combinations we allocate the excess, if any, of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill. We base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and, under some circumstances, studies from independent real estate appraisers to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, our management is ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives.\n \u2022 We amended and restated our existing management agreements with Sonesta for each of our hotels currently managed by Sonesta, which we refer to collectively as our Sonesta agreement, and our existing pooling agreement with Sonesta, which combines our management agreements with Sonesta for purposes of calculating gross revenues, payment of hotel operating expenses, payment of fees and distributions and minimum returns due to us, as further described below; \n (3) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 816 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 14.9 million square feet and annual minimum rent of $381,679, which represented approximately 38% of our total annual minimum returns and rents. Our net lease portfolio was 98% occupied as of December 31, 2019 by 194 tenants with a weighted (by annual minimum rent) lease term of 11.4 years, operating under 131 brands in 23 distinct industries. TA is our largest tenant. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 179 of our travel centers to TA under five leases that expire between 2029 and 2035 and require annual minimum rents of $246,088, which represents 24.6% of our consolidated annual minimum rents and returns.\nOur term debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility and term loan) as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Capital Resources\n (4) We lease 102 IHG branded hotels (20 Staybridge Suites\u00ae, 61 Candlewood Suites\u00ae, two InterContinental\u00ae, 11 Crowne Plaza\u00ae, three Holiday Inn\u00ae and five Kimpton\u00ae Hotels & Restaurants) in 30 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada to one of our TRSs. These 102 hotels are managed by subsidiaries of IHG under a combination management agreement. We lease one additional InterContinental\u00ae branded hotel in Puerto Rico to a subsidiary of IHG. The annual minimum return amount presented in the table on page 74 includes $7,908 of minimum rent related to the leased Puerto Rico hotel. The management agreement and the lease expire in 2036; IHG has two renewal options for 15 years each for all, but not less than all, of the hotels.  As of December 31, 2019, we held a security deposit of $75,717 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. This security deposit, if utilized, may be replenished and increased up to $100,000 from the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return and certain management fees. Under this agreement, IHG is required to maintain a minimum security deposit of $37,000.\nOur hotel operating agreements generally provide that, if necessary, we may provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed FF&E reserves or when no FF&E reserves are available. To the extent we make such additional fundings, our annual minimum returns or rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $242,571 for capital improvements in excess of FF&E reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels as follows:\n (8) We realized a $5,431 tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nHotel Portfolio\nNet Lease Portfolio\nOur public debt indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debt of $20,000 or more ($50,000 or more in the case of our indenture entered into in February 2016 and its supplements). Similarly, our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $75,000 or more.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net lease tenants operated across 23 distinct industries within the service-oriented retail sector of the U.S. economy.\n (3) Represents amounts we expect to fund for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts available in FF&E reserves and to our net lease properties as of December 31, 2019. \n\n (1) The year of lease expiration is pursuant to contract terms. ", "item_7_text": "Inflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest but recently there have been indications of inflation in the U.S. economy and elsewhere and some market forecasts indicate an expectation of increased inflation in the near to intermediate term. Future inflation might have both positive and negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our assets to increase. In periods of rapid U.S. inflation, our managers' and tenants' operating expenses may increase faster than their revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents and the security features, such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents are exhausted. To mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of, and our expected benefit from, these agreements and upon possible requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nResults of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\nRental income - hotels. The decrease in rental income - hotels is primarily the result of a previously deferred gain from a historical lease default becoming fully amortized in 2018 ($3,631), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($2,812) and amending the lease terms for 48 vacation units we lease at one hotel during 2019 ($1,265), partially offset by contractual rent increases under certain of our hotel leases ($49). We reduced rental income by $985 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $382 in the 2018 period to record rent on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2018 includes $147 of percentage rental income. No percentage rent was earned under our hotel leases in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization - hotels. The increase in depreciation and amortization - hotels is a result of the depreciation and amortization of improvements acquired with funds from our FF&E reserves or directly funded by us since January 1, 2018 ($24,072) and our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($5,778), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2018 ($17,521).\nHotel operations. In 2019, the U.S. hotel industry generally realized increases in ADR and RevPAR and no change in occupancy compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018 produced aggregate year over year decreases in ADR and RevPAR and a decline in occupancy. We believe these results are, in part, due to the disruption and displacement at certain of our hotels undergoing renovations, increased competition from new hotel room supply in certain markets and decreased business activity in areas where some of our hotels are located.\nIn an effort to reduce the effects of any increased energy costs in the future, we continuously study ways to improve the energy efficiency at all of our properties. Our property manager, RMR LLC, is a member of the Energy Star program, a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy that is focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Energy Star\u201d partner program, and a member of the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting energy efficiency at commercial properties through its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED\u00ae, green building program.\nRental income net lease portfolio. The decrease in rental income - net lease portfolio is a result of the sale of 20 travel centers to TA and our lease amendments with TA in January 2019 ($47,628), partially offset by rents related to properties acquired pursuant to the SMTA Transaction ($46,717). See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these transactions. We reduced rental income by $9,734 in the 2019 period and increased rental income by $12,127 in the 2018 period to record scheduled rent increases under certain leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our TA leases and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis. Rental income for 2019 and 2018 includes $4,238 and $3,548, respectively, of percentage rental income.\n \u2022 Sonesta will continue to manage 14 of our full-service hotels and the annual minimum returns due for these hotels will be reduced from $99,013 to $69,013; \n\n (7) In February 2017, we redeemed all 11,600,000 of our outstanding 7.125% Series D cumulative redeemable preferred shares at the stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption (an aggregate of $291,435). The liquidation preference of the redeemed shares exceeded the carrying amount for the redeemed shares as of the date of redemption by$9,893 and we reduced net income available for common shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2017 by that excess amount. \nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet. The aggregate transaction value of the SMTA Transaction was $2,482,382, including $2,384,577 in cash consideration, $82,069 of prepayment penalties to extinguish mortgage debt on the portfolio and $15,736 of other capitalized acquisition costs. The properties included in the portfolio are net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands that include quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states. We financed the SMTA Transaction with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with cash on hand, including net proceeds from our public offerings of senior unsecured notes, as further described above.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of operating expenses, funding the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return and reimbursement to Radisson of working capital and guaranty advances, if any. This additional return is not guaranteed.\n (8) Other includes 184 tenants with an average investment of $7,558 and average annual minimum rent of $509. \n \u2022 variable interest entities, or VIEs; \n\nOur net lease portfolio leases do not require FF&E escrow deposits. However, tenants under these leases are required to maintain the leased properties, including structural and non-structural components. Tenants under certain of our net lease portfolio leases, including TA, may request that we purchase qualifying capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases or we may agree to provide allowances for tenant improvements upon execution of new leases or when renewing our existing tenants. We funded $2,295 of capital improvements at certain of our net lease properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 of capital improvements under these leases during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Certain tenants are not obligated to request and we are not obligated to purchase any such improvements.\n \u2022 We and Sonesta agreed to sell, rebrand or repurpose our 39 extended stay hotels currently managed by Sonesta, with an aggregate carrying value of $480,547 and which currently require aggregate minimum returns of $49,467. As the hotels are sold, rebranded or repurposed, the management agreement for the applicable hotel(s) will terminate without our being required to pay Sonesta a termination fee and the annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement will decrease by the amount allocated to the applicable hotel(s); \nUnrealized losses on equity securities. Unrealized losses on equity securities represent the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of our investments in RMR Inc., which we sold in July 2019, and TA common shares to their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, which we historically referred to as our Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing January 1, 2020, or the Marriott Agreement. The Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements included 122 hotels, provided for aggregate annual minimum returns and rents due to us of $192,774 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2019, respectively. The previously available guarantee under the Marriott No. 234 agreement of $30,672 expired on December 31, 2019. The then existing security deposit held by us for the Marriott No. 234 agreement ($33,445 as of December 31, 2019) will continue to secure payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us under the Marriott Agreement and may be replenished up to the security deposit cap of $64,700 from 60% of the cash flows realized from operations of the 122 hotels after payment of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us, Marriott's base management fees and certain other advances by us or Marriott, if any. Marriott provided a new $30.0 million limited guaranty for 85% of the aggregate annual minimum returns due to us through 2026 under the Marriott Agreement if the security deposit is exhausted. Under the Marriott Agreement, we agreed to fund approximately $400,000 for capital improvements at certain hotels over a four year period. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 We amended and restated our existing management agreements with Sonesta for each of our hotels currently managed by Sonesta, which we refer to collectively as our Sonesta agreement, and our existing pooling agreement with Sonesta, which combines our management agreements with Sonesta for purposes of calculating gross revenues, payment of hotel operating expenses, payment of fees and distributions and minimum returns due to us, as further described below; \n (5) Other includes 119 distinct brands with an average investment of $11,119 and average annual minimum rent of $734. \nNone of our unsecured debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates.\nNet Lease Portfolio\n\nCertain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a finance or operating lease. The classification of a lease as finance, sales-type, direct financing or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property, appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. See Note 2 to consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the impact to our accounting for leases due to recent accounting pronouncements.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 80% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, management fees to Sonesta, our minimum return, an imputed FF&E reserve to us and reimbursement of operating loss or working capital advances, if any.\nOn September 18, 2019, we issued $825,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.350% unsecured senior notes due 2024, $450,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.750% unsecured senior notes due 2026 and $425,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.950% unsecured senior notes due 2029. We used the aggregate net proceeds from these offerings of $1,680,461, after underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, to finance a portion of the SMTA Transaction.\nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of operating expenses, funding the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return and reimbursement to Hyatt of working capital and guaranty advances, if any. This additional return is not guaranteed.\nOur hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters. Most of our management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return and rent payments to us in equal amounts throughout the year. So long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties, seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flows from these properties. If and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum returns and rents due to us are exhausted or expire, our financial results may begin to reflect more of the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate. The return payments to us under certain of our management agreements depend exclusively upon earnings at these properties and, accordingly, our income and cash flows from these properties reflect the seasonality of the hotel industry.\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense is due to higher average outstanding borrowings, primarily as a result of our financing of the SMTA Transaction, and a higher weighted average interest rate in 2019.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our net lease properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nWe present certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d within the meaning of applicable SEC rules, including funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated statements of income. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.\nOur Operating Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $5,346 of unspent leasing-related obligations under our net lease portfolio.\nWe determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques. These analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate, fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nGain on sale of real estate. We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate in 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers.\nWhen significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility, or the maturities of our indebtedness approach, we currently expect to explore refinancing alternatives. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt, issuing new equity securities and the sale of properties. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. We may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. Although we have not historically done so, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire or obtain mortgage financing on our existing properties.\nHotel Portfolio\n (6) As of December 31, 2019, we leased our 53 Sonesta branded hotels (seven Royal Sonesta\u00ae Hotels, seven Sonesta Hotels & Resorts\u00ae and 39 Sonesta ES Suites\u00ae hotels) in 26 states to one of our TRSs. The management agreements for two hotels expire on December 31, 2020 and includes automatic one year renewals. The management agreement for the remaining 51 hotels expires in 2037. Sonesta has two renewal options for 15 years each for all, but not less than all, of these 51 hotels.  As of December 31, 2019, we e have no security deposit or guaranty from Sonesta. Accordingly, payment by Sonesta of the minimum return due to us under this management agreement is limited to the hotels' available cash flows after the payment of operating expenses, including certain management fees, and we are financially responsible for operating cash flows deficits, if any.\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss of $8,451 on early extinguishment of debt in 2019 resulting from the termination of a term loan commitment we arranged in connection with the SMTA Transaction. We recorded a loss of $160 on early extinguishment of debt in 2018 in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility and term loan.\nOverview (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts and per room hotel data)\nFF&E Reserve income. FF&E reserve income represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures. The terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels. We do not report the amounts, if any, which are escrowed as FF&E reserves for our managed hotels as FF&E reserve income. The decrease in FF&E reserve income is the result of decreased sales at certain of our leased hotels in 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification. Under this Topic, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the IRC and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. Despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are subject to income tax in Canada, Puerto Rico and in certain states. Further, we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated tax return and are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (or benefit) includes the income tax provision (or benefit) related to the operations of the TRSs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The Income Taxes Topic also prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not\u201d that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the more likely than not\u201d standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Tax returns filed for the 2016 through 2019 tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense.\n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that up to 5% of the gross revenues of each of our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta will be escrowed for future capital expenditures as FF&E reserves,\u201d subject to available cash flow after payment of the annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement; \n (1) We recorded a $159,535 gain on sale of real estate during the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with the sales of 20 travel centers. We recorded a $9,348 gain on sale of real estate during the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the sales of three hotels. \nDepreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio. The increase in depreciation and amortization - net lease portfolio is a result of the net lease properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction ($32,023) and the depreciation and amortization of travel center improvements we purchased since January 1, 2018 ($438), partially offset by our travel center dispositions since January 1, 2018 ($11,175) and certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2018 ($8,244).\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $19,034 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our Radisson agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently do not expect to fund any capital improvements under this agreement in 2020. As we fund improvements in the future, the contractual minimum returns payable to us will increase. \n \u2022 Sonesta will continue to manage 14 of our full-service hotels and the aggregate annual minimum returns due for these hotels was reduced from $99,013 to $69,013; \nMany of our operating agreements contain security features, such as guarantees and security deposits, which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our agreements regardless of property performance. However, the effectiveness of various security features to provide us uninterrupted receipt of minimum returns and rents is not assured, especially if economic conditions generally decline for a prolonged period. Also, certain of the guarantees that we hold are limited in amount and duration and do not provide for payment of the entire amount of the applicable minimum returns.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned and managed a diverse portfolio of hotels and net lease properties across the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada with 151 brands across 24 industries.\nRelated Person Transactions\n\nOur ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities.\nWe currently expect to use cash on hand, the cash flows from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from any asset sales and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund our future debt maturities, operations, capital expenditures, distributions to our shareholders, property acquisitions and other general business purposes.\n (5) We recorded a loss of $8,451 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the termination of a term loan commitment we arranged in connection with the SMTA Transaction. We recorded losses of $160 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility and term loan and $146 on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the redemption of certain senior unsecured notes. \n (2) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \nOur calculations of FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and reconciliations of net income available for common shareholders, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements, to those amounts appear in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).\n (9) Represents weighted average common shares adjusted to reflect the potential dilution of unvested share awards. \n (3) We define hotel coverage as combined total hotel property level revenues minus all hotel property level expenses and FF&E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to hotel minimum returns or rents due to us (which data is provided to us by our managers or tenant), divided by the minimum returns or rents due to us. Coverage amounts for our IHG, Sonesta and Radisson agreements include data for periods prior to our ownership of certain hotel properties. Coverage amounts for our Sonesta agreement include data for three hotels prior to when these hotels were managed by Sonesta. \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that (1) our termination rights under those agreements for our 14 full service hotels managed by Sonesta are generally limited to performance and for cause,\u201d casualty and condemnation events, (2) a portfolio wide performance test now applies for determining whether the management agreement for any of our full-service hotels managed by Sonesta may be terminated for performance reasons, and (3) the provisions included in our historical pooling agreement that allowed either us or Sonesta to require the marketing for sale of non-economic hotels were removed; and \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that up to 5% of the gross revenues of each of our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta will be escrowed for future capital expenditures as FF&E reserves,\u201d subject to available cash flow after payment of the annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement; \nIn January 2019, in a series of transactions, we sold 20 travel centers in 15 states to TA for $308,200. We used a portion of the proceeds from these sales to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes, including hotel acquisitions.\n \u2022 classification of leases and the related impact to our financial statements; and \nIn addition to our minimum return, this management agreement provides for an annual additional return payment to us of $12,067 from the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, funding of the required FF&E reserve, if any, payment of our minimum return, payment of certain management fees and replenishment and expansion of the security deposit. In addition, the agreement provides for payment to us of 50% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment to us of the annual additional return amount. These additional return amounts are not guaranteed or secured by the security deposit we hold.\n \u2022 Previously, our Wyndham agreement required FF&E escrow deposits only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns. No FF&E escrow deposits were required during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $3,040 for capital improvements to certain hotels included in our Wyndham agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently expect to fund approximately $5,000 during 2020 for capital improvements under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. \n (1) 14 of our hotels and 17 of our net lease properties are on land leased partially or in its entirety. In each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us. Pursuant to the terms of our management agreements and leases, payments of ground lease obligations are generally made by our managers or tenants. However, if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease, we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center. We have included the future rent expense under these ground leases in the table above. \nWe test our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. An impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nComparable hotels data. We present RevPAR, average daily rate, or ADR, and occupancy for the periods presented on a comparable basis to facilitate comparisons between periods. We generally define comparable hotels as those that were owned by us and were open and operating for the entire periods being compared. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we excluded 10 hotels from our comparable results. Six of these hotels were not owned for the entire periods and four were closed for major renovations during part of the periods presented.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\n (6) TA is our largest tenant. We lease 179 travel centers (134 under the TravelCenters of America brand and 45 under the Petro Stopping Centers brand) to a subsidiary of TA under master leases that expire in 2029, 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2035, respectively. TA has two renewal options for 15 years each for all of the travel centers. In addition to the payment of our minimum rent, the TA leases provide for payment to us of percentage rent based on increases in total non-fuel revenues over base levels (3% of non-fuel revenues above threshold amounts defined in the agreements). Commencing in 2020, these leases provide for payment of an additional half percent (0.5%) of non-fuel revenues above 2019 non-fuel base revenues. TA's remaining deferred rent obligation of $57,247 as of December 31, 2019 is being paid in quarterly installments of $4,404 through January 31, 2023. \nManagement agreements and leases. At February 26, 2020, we owned 329 hotels operated under six agreements. We leased 328 of these hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that are managed by hotel operating companies and one is leased to a hotel operating company. We own 816 service-oriented properties with 194 tenants subject to triple net\u201d leases, where the tenants are generally responsible for payment of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our consolidated statements of comprehensive income include hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses of our managed hotels and rental income and other operating expenses from our leased hotels and net lease properties.\n\nWe define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total hotel property level revenues minus all hotel property level expenses and FF&E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us divided by the hotel minimum returns or rents due to us. More detail regarding coverage, guarantees and other features of our hotel operating agreements is presented in the tables and related notes on pages 74 through 76. For the year ended December 31, 2019, five of our six hotel operating agreements, representing 42.5% of our total annual minimum returns and minimum rents, generated coverage of less than 1.0x (with a range of 0.50x to 0.93x).\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net lease tenants operated across more than 131 brands. The following table identifies the top ten brands based on annualized minimum rent.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale.  As of December 31, 2019, shown below is the list of our top ten states where our net lease properties were located. No other state represents more than 3% of our net lease annual minimum rents.\nAs of January 1, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) were included in six portfolio agreements and managed by or leased to separate affiliates of IHG, Marriott, Sonesta, Hyatt, Radisson and Wyndham.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded a $39,296 loss on asset impairment during 2019 to reduce the carrying value of 19 net lease properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and two hotels to their estimated fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our top ten net lease tenants based on annualized minimum rent are listed below.\n (1) Includes properties located in 34 states. \n \u2022 allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses; \n (4) See page 78 for our definition of coverage. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n (7) This property is held for sale as of December 31, 2019. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $55,359 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our IHG agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently expect to fund approximately $15,000 for capital improvements under this agreement during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nFor further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 4, 5, 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference and our other filings with the SEC, including our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or our definitive Proxy Statement, to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. For further information about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC and our various agreements with TA and Sonesta, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services.\n \u2022 We extended the initial expiration date of the management agreements for our full-service hotels located in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA that are managed by Sonesta to expire in January 2037 to align with the initial expiration date for our other full-service hotels managed by Sonesta.  Except as described above, the economic terms of our amended and restated Sonesta agreement and amended and restated pooling agreement are consistent with the historical Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement.\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not fund capital improvements to any hotels operating under our Hyatt agreement. We currently expect to fund approximately $20,000 during 2020 for capital improvements to certain hotels under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in incentive business management fees paid to RMR LLC in 2019 with respect to 2018, and an increase in the minimum returns and rents paid to us as a result of our acquisitions and funding of improvements to certain properties since January 1, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in security deposits received or replenished in 2019 and higher interest payments in 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to our higher real estate acquisition activity in 2019 and an increase in our capital improvement fundings, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and a decrease in our hotel managers' purchases with FF&E reserves in 2018. The change to cash flows provided by financing activities in 2019 from cash used in financing activities in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in our net borrowings in 2019.\n (7) We lease our 22 Hyatt Place\u00ae branded hotels in 14 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Hyatt under a combination management agreement that expires in 2030; Hyatt has two renewal options for 15 years each for all, but not less than all, of the hotels.  We have a limited guaranty of $50,000 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available Hyatt guaranty was $19,655. The guaranty is limited in amount but does not expire in time and may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDuring 2019, we acquired three hotels with 794 rooms for an aggregate purchase price of $226,450, excluding capitalized acquisition costs of $3,087 using proceeds from certain dispositions, cash on hand or outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\n \u2022 Holdco issued to us a number of its shares of common stock representing approximately (but not more than) 34% of its outstanding shares of common stock (post-issuance); \nWe lease 48 vacation units in one of our Sonesta hotels to Destinations, under a lease that expires in on March 31, 2020 at which time Destinations will vacate the leased space.\nAs of February 26, 2020, 329 of our hotels (including one leased hotel) are included in six combination portfolio agreements and all 329 hotels were managed by or leased to hotel operating companies. Our 816 net lease properties are leased to 194 tenants as of December 31, 2019. The costs of operating and maintaining our properties are generally paid by the hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account. Our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses and for returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and, to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and rents, from their separate resources. Our hotel managers and tenants include Marriott, IHG, Sonesta, Wyndham, Hyatt and Radisson. TA is our largest net lease tenant. No other net lease tenant represents more than 1% of our total annualized minimum returns or rents.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nAcquisition and transaction related costs. Acquisition and transaction related costs represent costs related to our exploration of possible financing transactions.\nWe periodically evaluate our equity method investments for possible indicators of other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. These indicators may include the length of time and degree to which the market value of our investment is below our cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, our intent and ability to be a long term holder of the investment and other considerations. If the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, we may record an impairment charge to adjust the basis of the investment to its fair value.\nOur debt obligations at December 31, 2019 consisted of outstanding borrowings under our $1,000,000 revolving credit facility, our $400,000 term loan and $5,350,000 of publicly issued term debt. Our publicly issued term debt is governed by our indentures and related supplements. These indentures and related supplements and our credit agreement contain covenants that generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, and require us to maintain various financial ratios and our credit agreement restricts our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. Our credit agreement and our unsecured senior notes, indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager. As of December 31, 2019, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement.\n \u2022 income taxes.  We have determined that each of our wholly owned TRSs is a VIE, as defined under the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification\u2122, or the Codification. We have concluded that we must consolidate each of our wholly owned TRSs because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such VIE's performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each VIE, with the primary focus on losses, and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each VIE.\n (4) Acquisition and transaction related costs represents costs related to our exploration of possible financing transactions. \nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. For a comparison of consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 please see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpact of Inflation\nHotel operating revenues. The increase in hotel operating revenues is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,364), increased revenues at certain of our managed hotels due to increases in ADR and higher occupancies ($49,888) and the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,427), partially offset by decreased revenues at certain of our managed hotels primarily as a result of lower occupancies ($44,167) and decreased revenues at certain of our other managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($32,937). Additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page 76.\n \u2022 We and Sonesta agreed to sell, rebrand or repurpose our 39 extended stay hotels currently managed by Sonesta with an aggregate carrying value of $480,547 and which currently require aggregate annual minimum returns of $49,467. As the hotels are sold, rebranded or repurposed, the management agreement for the applicable hotel(s) will terminate without our being required to pay Sonesta a termination fee and our annual minimum returns due to us under our Sonesta agreement will decrease by the amount allocated to the applicable hotel(s); \nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta and Holdco pursuant to which we and Sonesta restructured our existing business arrangements, as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for all our 329 hotels, ADR decreased 1.5% to $128.76, occupancy decreased 0.9 percentage points to 72.5% and RevPAR decreased 2.7% to $93.35.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized higher state taxes during the 2019 period primarily due to an increase in the amount of state sourced income subject to income taxes.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR LLC, RMR Inc., TA and Sonesta and others related to them. For example: we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to our business and property management agreements with RMR LLC; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC; Adam Portnoy, the Chair of our Board of Trustees and one of our Managing Trustees, is the sole trustee, an officer and the controlling shareholder of ABP Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., a managing director, president and chief executive officer of RMR Inc., an officer and employee of RMR LLC, the chair of the board of directors and a managing director of TA, and, together with certain of his affiliates, a majority owner and director of Sonesta; John Murray, our other Managing Trustee and our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as an executive officer of RMR LLC and a director of Sonesta; and, until July 1, 2019, we owned shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. We also have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and which may have trustees, directors and officers who are also trustees, directors or officers of us, RMR LLC or RMR Inc., including: TA, which is our former subsidiary and largest tenant and of which we are the largest shareholder; and Sonesta, which is one of our hotel managers and is owned in part by Adam Portnoy and of which we own an approximately 34% equity interest.\n \u2022 assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate, intangible assets and equity investments; \nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates have been and will be consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nDuring 2019, we sold 130 net lease properties with 2.8 million square feet for aggregate proceeds of $513,012, excluding closing costs of $3,402. We used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes. As of December 31, 2019, we had 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 classified as held for sale.\nInterest income. The increase in interest income is due to higher average cash and restricted cash balances during 2019.\n (4) See page 78 for our definition of coverage. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n \u2022 We modified our Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement so that (1) our termination rights under those agreements for our 14 full-service hotels managed by Sonesta are generally limited to performance and for cause\u201d, casualty and condemnation events, (2) a portfolio wide performance test now applies for determining whether the management agreement for any of our full service hotels managed by Sonesta may be terminated for performance reasons, and (3) the provisions included in our historical pooling agreement that allowed either us or Sonesta to require the marketing for sale of non-economic hotels were removed; and \nIn addition to our minimum return, this agreement provides for payment to us of 60% of the hotels' available cash flows after payment of hotel operating expenses, funding of the required FF&E reserve, payment of our minimum return, payment of certain management fees and replenishment of the security deposit. This additional return amount is not guaranteed or secured by the security deposit.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the dividends we received from our former investment in RMR Inc.\n (1) Operating data includes data for certain hotels for periods prior to when we acquired them. \nAdditional details of our hotel operating agreements and net lease agreements are set forth in Notes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the table and notes thereto on pages 74 through 76 below.\nDebt Covenants\nWe maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC by meeting certain requirements. As a REIT, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income; however, the income realized by our TRSs in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate income tax rates. In addition, the income we receive from our hotels in Canada and Puerto Rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nSome observers believe severe weather in different parts of the world over the last few years is evidence of global climate change. Severe weather may have an adverse effect on certain properties we own. Rising sea levels could cause flooding at some of our properties, which may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own. We mitigate these risks by procuring, or requiring our managers or tenants to procure, insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses resulting from the consequences of losses caused by climate change. However, we cannot be sure that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that future storms, rising sea levels or other changes that may occur due to future climate change could not have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 for our 319 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2018, ADR decreased 1.1% to $126.30, occupancy decreased 0.3 percentage points to 73.0% and RevPAR decreased 1.5% to $92.20.\n (8) We lease our nine Radisson branded hotels (four Radisson\u00ae Hotels & Resorts, four Country Inns & Suites\u00ae by Radisson and one Radisson Blu\u00ae hotel) in six states to one of our TRSs and these hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Radisson under a combination management agreement which expires in 2035 and Radisson has two 15 year renewal options for all, but not less than all, of the hotels.  We have a limited guaranty of $47,523 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available Radisson guaranty was $41,216. The guaranty is limited in amount but does not expire in time and may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return.\n (2) Represents the security deposit balance as of December 31, 2019. We may draw upon security deposits to cover any rent or return shortfalls thereby decreasing the potential obligation to repay some of these deposits. \nWe periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators. These indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability, cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value.\n\n (5) On December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, historically referred to as our Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing January 1, 2020. The Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements included 122 hotels, provided for aggregate annual minimum returns and rents due to us of $192,774 and were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2019, respectively. As of January 1, 2020, we leased our 122 Marriott branded hotels (two full service Marriott\u00ae, 35 Residence Inn by Marriott\u00ae, 71 Courtyard by Marriott\u00ae, 12 TownePlace Suites by Marriott\u00ae and two SpringHill Suites by Marriott\u00ae hotels) in 31 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels under the Marriott agreement are managed by subsidiaries of Marriott and require aggregate annual minimum returns of $190,573. The Marriott Agreement is scheduled to expire in 2035 and Marriott has two renewal options for 10 years each for all, but not less than all, of the hotels. \nWhile we believe we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or other types of financings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\n (1) Represents historical cost of our net lease properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any. \nIn February 2020, we entered an agreement to acquire three net lease properties with approximately 6,696 square feet in two states with leases requiring an aggregate of $387 of annual minimum rents for an aggregate sales price of $7,000, excluding closing costs, using existing cash balances.\nAs of December 31, 2019, lease expirations at our net lease properties by year are as follows. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n (9) We lease our 20 Wyndham branded hotels (four Wyndham Hotels and Resorts\u00ae and 16 Hawthorn Suites\u00ae hotels) in 13 states to one of our TRSs. The hotels are managed by a subsidiary of Wyndham under a combination management agreement which expires on September 30, 2020. We have no guarantee or security deposit from Wyndham. Payment by Wyndham is limited to the available cash flows after payment of operating expenses. Wyndham is not entitled to any base management fees for the remainder of the agreement.  The following tables summarize the operating statistics, including ADR, occupancy and RevPAR reported to us by our hotel managers or tenants by management agreement or lease for the periods indicated. All operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our hotel managers and tenants for the indicated periods. We have not independently verified our managers' or tenants' operating data.\n \u2022 Previously, our Sonesta agreement did not require FF&E escrow deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $114,082 for capital improvements to certain hotels included in our Sonesta agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Under our amended agreement with Sonesta, FF&E deposits are required only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns. We currently expect to fund approximately $30,000 during 2020 for capital improvements under this agreement using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \n (3) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent, respectively. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \n (4) We define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve months period reported based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating information furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. Properties for which tenants do not report operating information are excluded from the coverage calculations. Coverage amounts include data for certain properties for periods prior to when we assumed ownership of them. \n (2) Each of our hotel management agreements or lease provides for payment to us of an annual minimum return or rent, respectively. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees or security deposits as more fully described below. In addition, certain of our hotel management agreements provide for payment to us of additional amounts to the extent of available cash flows as defined in the management agreement. Payments of these additional amounts are not guaranteed or secured by deposits. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments necessary to record rent on a straight line basis. \nThese accounting policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience and the experience of our management and our Board of Trustees, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us, and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate. In the future, we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\n (4) Projected interest expense is interest attributable to only debt obligations listed above at existing rates as of December 31, 2019 and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments, additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, new debt issuances or changes in interest rates.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEquity in earnings of an investee. Equity in earnings of an investee represents our proportionate share of the earnings of Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC.\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $51,056 for capital improvements to certain hotels under our then-existing Marriott agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Under the Marriott Agreement, we agreed to fund approximately $400,000 for capital improvements at certain hotels over a four year period. We currently expect to fund approximately $80,000 of this amount during 2020 using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the contractual minimum returns payable to us increase. \nOther operating expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is a result of operating expenses we pay at certain properties we acquired as part of the SMTA Transaction in 2019.\nOur credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased to up to $2,300,000 on a combined basis in certain circumstances.\nNet income. Our net income, net income per common share (basic and diluted) each increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above.\nConcerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our properties to increase. We do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations, because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or managers directly or in the longer term, passed through and paid by customers of our properties. Although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future, laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or managers and their ability to pay rent or returns to us.\nWe currently intend to continue to expand our investments by primarily acquiring additional hotels and other single tenant, net lease properties and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of RMR LLC to locate, acquire and manage such properties. One of our goals in acquiring single tenant, net lease properties is to further diversify our sources of rents and returns with the intention of improving the security of our cash flows. Another of our goals is to purchase properties that produce rents, less property operating expenses, that are greater than our capital costs to acquire the properties and, accordingly, allow us to increase distributions to our shareholders over time. We expect that most of our acquisition efforts will focus on hotel and net lease properties; however, we may consider acquiring other types of properties.\nImpact of Climate Change\n (2) We recorded a $39,296 loss on asset impairment during the three months ended December 31, 2019 to reduce the carrying value of 19 net lease properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell and two hotels to their estimated fair value. \nOur $400,000 term loan, which matures on July 15, 2023, is prepayable without penalty at any time. We are required to pay interest on the amount outstanding under our term loan at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 135 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our term loan was 3.04%.\nOur principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to our shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels, minimum rents from our leased hotel and net lease portfolio and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We receive minimum returns and rents from our managers and tenants monthly. We may receive additional returns, percentage rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions, if any, either monthly or quarterly, and these amounts are usually subject to annual reconciliations. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. However, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our managers and tenants may become unable or unwilling to pay minimum returns and rents to us when due, and, as a result, our cash flows and net income would decline and we may need to reduce the amount of, or even eliminate, our distributions to common shareholders.\n (3) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n (5) Leases subject to full or partial corporate guarantee. \nWe calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, less any unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the item shown below and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our dividend yield and the dividend yield of other REITs, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nWhen cash flows from our hotels under certain of our agreements are less than the minimum returns or rents contractually due to us, we have utilized the applicable security features in our agreements to cover some of these shortfalls. However, several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts, are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire, especially if our hotel renovation and rebranding activities do not result in improved operating results at these hotels. Accordingly, the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured. If any of our hotel managers, tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us, our cash flows will decline and we may become unable to continue to pay distributions to our shareholders or the amount of the distributions may decline.\n (3) Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, net represent the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of our investments in RMR Inc. and TA common shares to their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We sold our shares of RMR Inc. on July 1, 2019. \nOur Managers and Tenants\nGenerally, we do not expect inflation to have a material adverse impact on our financial results for the next 12 months or for the currently foreseeable future thereafter.\nCertain of our management arrangements or leases are subject to full or limited guarantees or are secured by a security deposit which we control. These guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us. Some of our managers and tenants, or their affiliates, may also supplement cash flows from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees or security deposits. Guarantee payments, security deposit applications or supplemental payments to us, if any, made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations, but, under some of our agreements, the manager or tenant may recover these guarantee or supplemental payments and the security deposits may be replenished from subsequent cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and rents are paid.\nSince January 1, 2020, we sold four vacant net lease properties with approximately 160,434 square feet in three states for an aggregate sales price of $5,010, excluding closing costs. Additional details of these transactions are set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have also commenced marketing certain hotels as part of our previously announced plan to sell approximately $300,000 of hotels to reduce our financial leverage. We expect to sell the 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham and have agreed to sell or rebrand 33 hotels as part of the Marriott Agreement. We also expect to sell, rebrand or repurpose 39 hotels currently managed by Sonesta. We expect to use the proceeds from any sales of these hotels to repay debt or for general business purposes.\nNeither our indentures and their supplements nor our credit agreement contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by a change in our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement, our highest senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if that debt rating is downgraded, our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility and term loan would increase.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed the SMTA Transaction as a result of which, we acquired 767 properties with 12.4 million rentable square feet for an aggregate transaction value of $2,482,382. The portfolio consisted of 767 service-oriented retail properties net leased to tenants in 23 distinct industries and 163 brands including quick service and casual dining restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automotive parts and services and other service-oriented and necessity-based industries across 45 states.\nIn order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility and $400,000 term loan which are governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is July 15, 2022, and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, we have an option to extend the maturity date of this facility for two additional six month periods. We are required to pay interest at the rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 120 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019, on the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also have to pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 25 basis points per annum at December 31, 2019. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.80%. As of December 31, 2019, we had $377,000 outstanding and $623,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility. As of February 27, 2020, we had $437,000 outstanding and $563,000 available to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net lease properties were 98% occupied and we had 17 properties available for lease. During 2019 we entered into lease renewals for 217,807 rentable square feet at weighted (by rentable square feet) average rents that were 0.75% below prior rents for the same space. The weighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term for these leases was 8.1 years and leasing concessions and capital commitments for these leases were $551, or $0.31 per square foot, per lease year.\n (2) Operating data includes data for three hotels prior to when these hotels were managed by Sonesta. \nWe originally held a security deposit of $64,700 under this agreement to cover payment shortfalls of our minimum return. As of December 31, 2019, the available balance of this security deposit was $33,445. This security deposit may be replenished from a share of the hotels' available cash flows in excess of our minimum return and certain management fees. Marriott has also provided us with a $30,000 limited guaranty to cover payment shortfalls up to 85% of our minimum return after the available security deposit balance has been depleted. This limited guaranty expires in 2026.\nThe table and related notes below through page 76 summarize significant terms of our hotel lease and management agreements as of December 31, 2019. These tables also include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our hotel managers and tenant. These statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for our hotel properties. We consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables and related notes on the following pages to be important measures of our managers' and tenant's success in operating our hotel properties and their ability to continue to pay us. However, this third party reported information is not a direct measure of our financial performance and we have not independently verified the operating data.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta pursuant to which we and Sonesta modified our existing business arrangements. Additional details regarding this transaction are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn February 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction agreement with Sonesta and Holdco pursuant to which we and Sonesta restructured our business arrangements, as follows:\nVarious percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as FF&E reserves to fund future capital improvements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our hotel managers and tenants deposited $73,189 into these accounts and spent $208,241 from the FF&E reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels. As of December 31, 2019, there was $53,626 on deposit in these escrow accounts, which was held directly by us and is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash.\n \u2022 We extended the initial expiration date of the management agreements for our full-service hotels located in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA that are managed by Sonesta to expire in January 2037 to align with the initial expiration date for our other full-service hotels managed by Sonesta.  Except as described above, the economic terms of our amended and restated Sonesta agreement and amended and restated pooling agreement are consistent with the historical Sonesta agreement and pooling agreement. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Item 9B. Other information and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 12 years for personal property. We amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract. We do not depreciate the allocated cost of land. Purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates. Incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nWe are a REIT organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 1,145 properties in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico.\nWe define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us, weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve month period based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating information furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. Properties for which tenants do not report operating information are excluded from the coverage calculations. As of December 31, 2019, our net lease properties generated coverage of 2.32x.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling $353,619 using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. On January 16, 2020, we declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common share, or approximately $88,864, to shareholders of record on January 27, 2020. We paid this distribution on February 20, 2020 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding our distributions, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe amended our agreement with Wyndham in 2019 whereby the term of the management agreement will expire on September 30, 2020 unless sooner terminated with respect to any of our Wyndham hotels that are sold or rebranded. We expect to sell the remaining 20 hotels currently managed by Wyndham by that expiration date. Wyndham was previously paying us 85% of the annual minimum returns due under the management agreement. Under the amendment, Wyndham will pay to us all available cash flows of the hotels after payment of hotel operating expenses. Wyndham will not be entitled to any base management fees for the remainder of the agreement term.\n\nSeasonality\n (6) We recorded a $1,997 loss contingency during the three months ended December 31, 2019 for an expected settlement of a historical pension withdrawal liability for a hotel we rebranded. \nWe are environmentally conscious and aware of the impact our properties have on the environment. We and our tenants and managers have implemented numerous initiatives to encourage recycling of plastics, paper and metal or glass containers; we have programs to encourage reduced water and energy use at a hotel guest's option by not laundering towels and linens every day. When we renovate our hotels we generally use energy efficient products including but not limited to lighting, windows and HVAC equipment and many of the appliances in our extended stay hotels are Energy Star rated. We or our tenants or managers have also installed car battery charging stations at some of the properties in our portfolio to accommodate environmentally aware customers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Represents the historical cost of our hotel properties plus capital improvements funded by us less impairment write-downs, if any, and excludes capital improvements made from FF&E reserves funded from hotel operations that do not result in increases in hotel minimum returns or rents. \n \u2022 Holdco issued to us a number of its shares of common stock representing approximately (but not more than) 34% of its outstanding share of common stock (post-issuance); \nChanges in our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows: (1) cash flows provided by operating activities increased from $596,953 in 2018 to $617,722 in 2019; (2) cash used in investing activities increased from $427,742 in 2018 to $2,130,044 in 2019; and (3) cash flows from financing activities changed from $190,704 of cash used by financing activities in 2018 to $1,517,578 of cash provided in financing activities in 2019.\nManagement Agreements, Leases and Operating Statistics (dollar amounts in thousands)\nWe are exiting our relationship with Wyndham. On November 1, 2019, we rebranded two full-service hotels previously managed by Wyndham in Chicago, IL and Irvine, CA to the Sonesta brands. We also lease 48 vacation units in the Chicago, IL Sonesta hotel to a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (NYSE: WYND), or Destinations, which requires annual minimum rent of $1,537. We amended this lease so the term of the lease expires on March 31, 2020, at which time Destinations will vacate the leased space.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 816 net lease properties located in 44 states were leased to 194 tenants. These tenants operate in 23 distinct industries including travel centers, casual dining and quick service restaurants, movie theaters, health and fitness, automobile service and others. TA is our largest tenant and leases 179 travel centers under five lease agreements that expire between 2029 and 2035 and require annual minimum rents of $246,088, which represents approximately 24.6% of our total minimum returns and rent as of December 31, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative costs is primarily due to a decrease in business management incentive fee expense ($53,635), partially offset by a loss contingency ($1,997) and increased business management fees ($1,665) in 2019.\n (2) Each of the leases in our net lease portfolio provides for payment to us of minimum rent. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent amounts represent cash rent amounts due to us and exclude adjustments, if any, to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks at our travel centers on a straight line basis, or any reimbursement of expenses paid by us. \nHotel operating expenses. The increase in hotel operating expenses is a result of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2018 ($53,738), an increase in wage and benefit costs, sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs at certain of our managed hotels resulting primarily from higher occupancies and general expense increases ($31,216), the conversion of one hotel from a leased to managed property during 2018 ($4,642) and an increase in real estate taxes at certain of our hotels ($1,988), partially offset by operating expense decreases at certain managed hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of 2019 resulting primarily from lower occupancies ($33,382), an increase in the amount of guaranty and security deposit utilization under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($24,331) and a decrease in the amount of guaranty and security deposit replenishment under certain of our hotel operating agreements ($10,009). Certain guarantees and security deposits which have been applied to past payment deficits may be replenished from a share of subsequent cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements. When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were increased by $734 and $10,743 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such replenishments. When our guarantees and security deposits are utilized to cover shortfalls of hotels' cash flows from the minimum payments due to us, we reflect such utilizations in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a decrease to hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses were decreased by $29,897 and $5,569 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of such utilization.\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into agreements with Marriott, which combined our three then-existing Marriott operating agreements, historically referred to as the Marriott Nos. 1, 234 and 5 agreements, into a single portfolio for a 16-year term commencing on January 1, 2020. Additional details of this agreement are set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn July 1, 2019, we sold all the shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. that we owned in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $40.00 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement among us, RMR Inc., certain other REITs managed by RMR LLC that also sold their class A common stock of RMR Inc. in the offering and the underwriters named therein. We received net proceeds of $93,892 from this sale, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and after other offering expenses, which we used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For more information regarding the sale of our shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc., see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land, buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their relative fair values and each component generally has a different useful life. For acquired real estate, we record building, land, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and, if applicable, the value of acquired in-place leases, the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value. For transactions that qualify as business combinations we allocate the excess, if any, of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill. We base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and, under some circumstances, studies from independent real estate appraisers to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, our management is ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives.\n \u2022 We amended and restated our existing management agreements with Sonesta for each of our hotels currently managed by Sonesta, which we refer to collectively as our Sonesta agreement, and our existing pooling agreement with Sonesta, which combines our management agreements with Sonesta for purposes of calculating gross revenues, payment of hotel operating expenses, payment of fees and distributions and minimum returns due to us, as further described below; \n (3) As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 net lease properties with a carrying value of $87,493 and annual minimum rent of $5,625 classified as held for sale. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 816 net lease service-oriented retail properties with 14.9 million square feet and annual minimum rent of $381,679, which represented approximately 38% of our total annual minimum returns and rents. Our net lease portfolio was 98% occupied as of December 31, 2019 by 194 tenants with a weighted (by annual minimum rent) lease term of 11.4 years, operating under 131 brands in 23 distinct industries. TA is our largest tenant. As of December 31, 2019, we leased 179 of our travel centers to TA under five leases that expire between 2029 and 2035 and require annual minimum rents of $246,088, which represents 24.6% of our consolidated annual minimum rents and returns.\nOur term debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility and term loan) as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Capital Resources\n (4) We lease 102 IHG branded hotels (20 Staybridge Suites\u00ae, 61 Candlewood Suites\u00ae, two InterContinental\u00ae, 11 Crowne Plaza\u00ae, three Holiday Inn\u00ae and five Kimpton\u00ae Hotels & Restaurants) in 30 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada to one of our TRSs.

To the extent we make such additional fundings, our annual minimum returns or rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we funded $242,571 for capital improvements in excess of FF&E reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels as follows:\n (8) We realized a $5,431 tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nHotel Portfolio\nNet Lease Portfolio\nOur public debt indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debt of $20,000 or more ($50,000 or more in the case of our indenture entered into in February 2016 and its supplements).

Washington DC, Canada, and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2019. The properties include hotels and net lease properties. \n\n2019 Financial Highlights\n- Hotel operating revenues increased 1.6% to $1.99 billion due to acquisitions, higher ADR and occupancies at some hotels. This was partially offset by decreases at hotels undergoing renovations.\n- Rental income decreased due to asset sales and lease amendments. \n- FFO (non-GAAP measure) was $608 million compared to $606 million in 2018.\n- Completed a major $2.48 billion acquisition of 767 net lease retail properties.\n\nHotel Portfolio\n- Owned 329 hotels operated under brands like Marriott, IHG, Sonesta. \n- 5 of 6 hotel agreements had coverage ratios below 1.0x meaning cash flows were below minimum returns.\n- Funded $243 million of capital improvements to hotels in 2019.\n\nNet Lease Portfolio \n- Owned 816 net lease properties leased to 194 tenants.\n- 98% occupied as of December 31, 2019. \n- TravelCenters of America is the largest tenant, representing 65.5% of annual minimum rents.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Primarily relies on minimum returns from hotels and rents from net leases.\n- Has a $1 billion revolving credit facility and $400 million term loan.\n- Paid distributions of $354 million to shareholders in 2019.\n\nThat covers the major points from the report.
