MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include projections, predictions, expectations or statements as to beliefs or future events or results, or refer to other matters that are not purely statements of historical facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on various factors and were derived using numerous assumptions. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like may\u201d, will\u201d, should\u201d, expect\u201d, plan\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, believe\u201d, estimate\u201d, predict\u201d, potential\u201d, or continue\u201d or the negative of those words and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements reflect only our predictions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties should materialize, or if underlying assumptions should prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Further, factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statement s may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in our plans and strategies and the results thereof;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 12: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nunexpected changes in the housing market, business markets, and/or general economic conditions in our market area, or a slower-than-anticipated economic recovery, which might lead to increased or decreased demand for loans, deposits and other products and services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 13: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nunexpected changes in market interest rates or monetary policy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 14: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of new laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might require changes to our business model;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 15: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might impact our ability to collect on outstanding loans or otherwise negatively impact our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhigher than anticipated loan losses or the insufficiency of the allowance for credit losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour potential exposure to various types of market risks, such as interest rate risk and credit risk;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to recover the fair values of available for sale securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour obligation to fund commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in consumer confidence, spending and savings habits relative to the services we provide;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinued relationships with major customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits, and providing various financial services that may affect our profitability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of bank entities while controlling our costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in competitive, governmental, regulatory, accounting, technological and other factors that may affect us specifically or the banking industry generally, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 25: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nchanges in our sources and availability of liquidity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of pending and future legal proceedings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nlosses that we may realize from off-balance sheet arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should also carefully consider additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2017, net interest income increased to $11.7 million from $11.2 million in 2016, a 4.59% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million in 2016 to $13.6 million in 2017, a 2.45% increase. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.9 million, an 8.76% decrease from $2.1 million in 2016. Due to the increase in tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Reform Act, net income decreased by $0.2 million to $0.9 million in 2017 compared to $1.1 million in 2016.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nGeneral. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported consolidated net income of $0.9 million ($0.33 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $1.1 million ($0.40 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the 2017 consolidated net income was mainly due $0.6 million increase in tax expense due to the effect of the decrease in the federal tax rate on deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net income before taxes of $1.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in net income before taxes was an overall increase in interest income due to a larger volume of loans in 2017 compared to 2016, a lower provision for loan losses in 2017 compared to 2016, and a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in the volume of interest earning time deposits in 2017 compared to 2016. Annualized return on average assets was 0.23% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2016. Annualized return on average equity was 2.65% and 3.17% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The dividend payout ratio was 123.0% at December 31, 2017 compared to 101.0% at December 31, 2016. The equity to asset ratio was 8.74% and 8.71% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, repectively.\nNet Interest Income. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities.\nThe Company's net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by the Company's average interest-earning assets.\nNet interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank's loans are residential and commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate, and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.\nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.7 million compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.5 million, or a 4.6% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million for 2016 to $13.6 million for 2017, a $0.3 million, or a 2.45% increase, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans.\nTotal interest expense decreased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $1.9 million in 2017, a $0.2 million or an 8.76% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average deposits as well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.12% compared to 2.98% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Credit risk includes, but is not limited to, the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the Bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan. The Bank monitors its loan portfolio loan delinquencies monthly. All loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the Bank's portfolio as a group are evaluated. The Bank's management estimates an allowance for loan losses. Included in determining the calculation are such factors as historical losses for each loan portfolio, current market value of the loan's underlying collateral, inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy, economic trends, consideration of\nparticular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectability.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made a provision of $0.3 million for loan losses, compared to a provision of $0.9 million for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Bank decreased its provision for credit losses compared to the prior period as specifically reserved, impaired loans were resolved. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses equaled 77.7% of nonaccrual and past due loans compared to 65.6% at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $0.2 million compared to $1.5 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities sold, and income on bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Noninterest income decreased from $1.6 million in 2016 to $1.3 million in 2017, a $0.3 million, or 18.67% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to $0.4 million decrease in other income due to a death benefit associated with BOLI recorded in 2016, partially offset by an overall $0.2 million increase in other fees and commissions.\nNoninterest Expenses. Other non-interest expenses decreased from $10.9 million in 2016 to $10.8 million in 2017, a $0.1 million or 0.53% decrease. Salary and employee benefits decreased by $0.04 million, or 0.76%, due to a decrease in overall salaries paid to employees in 2017 compared to 2016. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $0.1 million in 2017. The increase is due to software purchased by the Bank for several deparments in 2017. Legal, accounting and other professional fees increased from $0.8 million in 2016 to $0.9 million in 2016, a $0.1 million, or 18.23% increase. The increase was due to higher legal and accounting fees paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Data processing and item processing services decreased by $0.1 million, or 18.70%, to $0.6 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The decrease was due to the renegotiation of several services contracts in 2017. FDIC insurance costs decreased by $0.04 million, or 12.85%. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 107.69 %, from $0.1 million in 2016, to $0.2 in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in printing of marketing materials expenses. Loan collection costs decreased to $0.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.1 million, or 61.58% decrease. The decrease is due to a decrease in the amount of collection expenses paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Telephone cost increased by $0.1 million, or 43.75%, to $0.3 million in 2017 compared to $0.2 million in 2016. The increase was due to a new phone system purchased and implemented in 2017. Other expenses decreased to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.2 million, or 10.27% decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in ATM expenses and office supplies purchased in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.9 million, compared to an income tax credit of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.0 million or 1,200.0% decrease. This increase was primarily due to $0.8 million higher income before taxes and $0.6 million tax expense associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the federal tax rate included in the Tax Reform Act.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets increased by $1.1 million, or 0.26% to $389.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to the $388.4 million at December 31, 2016. Increases in cash, and loans, offset by a decrease in investment securities available for sale, were the reasons for the increase.\nCash\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in Federal Funds at yearend 2017.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company's investment policy authorizes management to invest in traditional securities instruments in order to provide ongoing liquidity, income and a ready source of collateral that can be pledged in order to access other sources of funds. The investment portfolio consists mainly of securities available for sale. Securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability management strategy, liquidity management, interest rate risk management, regulatory capital management or other similar factors.\nThe investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal obligations. The income from state and municipal obligations is exempt from federal income tax. State and municipal obligations from the State of Maryland are exempt from state income taxes. We use the investment portfolio as a source of both liquidity and earnings. Management continuously evaluates investment options that will produce income without assuming significant credit or interest rate risk and looks for opportunities to use liquidity from maturing investments to reduce our use of high cost time deposits and borrowed funds.\nDuring 2017, the Company's investment securities portfolio totaled $89.3 million, a $5.3 million or 5.6%, decrease from $94.6 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by $19.5 million of net sales and redemption of investment securities, offset by $13.8 million of purchases and a 0.4 million increase in the market value of available for sale securities.\nThe composition of investment securities, at carrying value, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

primarily due to $79.9 million in new originations outpacing pay downs and a slowing in the pace of impaired loan resolutions. This change in the composition of the loan portfolio resulted primarily from the $20.1 million increase in indirect loans, consumer loans and commercial real estate, offset by $13.5 million decrease in residential real estate, commercial and industrial mortgages and construction loans.\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio, both by loan category and by fixed and adjustable rates, at December 31, 2017.

Placing a loan on nonaccrual status means that we no longer accrue interest on such loan and reverse any interest previously accrued but not collected. Management may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a 90 day past due loan that is both well secured and in the process of collection. An asset is well secured\u201d if it is secured by (1) collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is in the process of collection\u201d if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in prepayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan and remains current.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loans' effective interest rates for loans that are not collateral dependent.\nThe Bank seeks to control delinquencies through diligent collection efforts. For consumer loans, the Bank sends out payment reminders on the seventh and twelfth days after a payment is due. If a consumer loan becomes 15 days past due, the account is transferred to the Bank's collections department, which will contact the borrower by telephone and/or letter before the account becomes 30 days past due. If a consumer loan becomes more than 30 days past due, the Bank will continue its collection efforts and will move to repossession or foreclosure by the 45th day if the Bank has reason to believe that the collateral may be in jeopardy or the borrower has failed to respond to prior communications. The Bank may move to repossess or foreclose in all instances in which a consumer loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. After repossession of a motor vehicle, the borrower has a 15-day statutory right to redeem the vehicle and is entitled to 10 days' notice before the sale of a repossessed vehicle. The Bank sells the vehicle as promptly as feasible after the expiration of these periods. If the amount realized from the sale of the vehicle is less than the loan amount, the Bank may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. The Bank follows similar collection procedures with respect to commercial loans.\nOur current charge-off policy is as follows:\nWhen the probability for full payment of a loan is unlikely, the Bank will initiate a full charge-off or a partial write-down of the asset based upon the status of the loan. The following guidelines apply:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsumer loans less than $25,000 for which payments of principal and/or interest are past due ninety (90) days are charged-off and referred for collection.

In order to make this determination, an updated evaluation or appraisal of the property is obtained.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank experienced a $0.5 million or 11.7% decrease in the total nonperforming loans, as management has taken an aggressive approach to bring these impaired assets to resolution.

Nonperforming assets represented 0.94% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2016. The level of nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to decreases in nonaccrual loans of $0.5 million. Management has worked diligently to identify borrowers that may be facing difficulties in order to restructure terms where appropriate, secure additional collateral or pursue foreclosure and other secondary sources of repayment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Credit Risk Management\nThe Bank's allowance for credit losses is based on the probable estimated losses that may be sustained in its loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and (2) ASC Topic 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established to estimate losses that may occur on loans by recording a provision for loan losses that is charged to earnings in the current period. The allowance is evaluated on at least a quarterly basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historic experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Measured impairment and credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan or a portion of the loan's balance is not collectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to individual loans that are classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and primarily includes nonaccrual and TDRs. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price, whichever is appropriate, of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan. For collateral-dependent impaired loans, any measured impairment is properly charged off against the loan and allowance in the applicable reporting period. The specific component may fluctuate from period to period if changes occur in the nature and volume of impaired loans.\nThe general component covers pools of similar loans and is based upon historical loss experience of the Bank or peer bank group if the Bank's loss experience is deemed by management to be insufficient and several qualitative factors. These qualitative factors address various risk characteristics in the Bank's loan portfolio after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data. The general component may fluctuate from period to period if changes occur in the mix of the Bank's loan portfolio, economic conditions, or specific industry conditions.\nA test of the adequacy of the allowance, using the methodology outlined above, is performed by management and reported to the Board of Directors on at least a quarterly basis. The complex evaluations involved in such testing require significant estimates. Management uses available data to establish the allowance at a prudent level, recognizing that the determination is inherently subjective, and that future adjustments may be necessary, depending upon many items including a change in economic conditions affecting specific borrowers, or in general economic conditions, and new information that becomes available. However, there are no assurances that the allowance will be sufficient to absorb losses on nonperforming loans, or that the allowance will be sufficient to cover losses on nonperforming loans in the future.\nThe allowance was $2.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of total portfolio loans was 0.95% at December 31, 2017 and 0.94% at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded net charge offs of $0.23 million, compared to net charge offs of $1.54 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table reflects activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:\nTable

Within the deposit base, noninterest bearing deposits balances increased $3.9 million, or 3.9%, interest bearing checking account balances decreased $0.6 million, or 2.2%, interest bearing savings account balances increased by $5.9 million, or 7.4%, money market balances increased $1.5 million, or 8.2%, and time deposit balances decreased by $9.7 million, or 9.2%, when compared to the amounts at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution for time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nThree months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,616\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver three months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,454\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver twelve months through twenty-four months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,825\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOver twenty-four months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,557\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Time Deposits of $100,000 or More\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,452\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nThe Bank uses borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Atlanta, of which it is a member, to supplement funding from deposits. The Bank's total credit availability is $97.5 million and it may draw $52.4 million which is secured by a floating lien on the Bank's residential first mortgage loans. There was a $10 million convertible\nadvance with a 3.28% rate of interest that matured November 1, 2017. A variable rate (3-month LIBOR) $10 million borrowing was executed on November 1, 2017 to replace it, which was converted into a 2.105% fixed rate payment using a pay-fixed swap on the same date. There was a $5 million convertible advance that settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rate of interest and was callable quarterly, starting July 23, 2009. There was a $5 million convertible advance executed August 22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly, starting August 22, 2011.\nThe pay-fixed swap executed November 1, 2017 is based on a $10 million notional amount, matures on 10/30/2022 (5 years) and has a floating received leg based on 3-month LIBOR. The Bank also entered into two forward starting swaps on the same date which will convert the two fixed rate $5 million borrowings maturing in July and August 2018 into fixed rates of 2.235% and 2.246%, respectively. The market value of the derivative contracts at December 31, 2017 was $48,809.\nThe Bank also has two federal funds lines of credit in the amounts of $5 million and $6 million, of which nothing was outstanding at December 1, 2017.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmple capital is necessary to sustain growth, provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in asset values and safeguard the funds of depositors. Capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and enables us to manage assets and liabilities effectively.\nStockholders' equity increased to $34.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2016. The $0.2 million, or 0.7%, increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $0.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and $0.1 million investment resulting from the Bank's dividend reinvestment plan, offset by $0.2 million decrease as a result of the $1.1 million or 123% of net income payout in dividends. The book value of the Company's common stock was $12.15 at December 31, 2017 and $12.13 at December 31, 2016.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises their risk based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These Basel III Capital Rules were applicable to the Bank effective January 1, 2015, but they do not apply to the Company since it is a small bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in total consolidated assets. The Federal Reserve Board raised the threshold for the small bank holding company exclusion from $500 million to $1 billion in April 2015.\nThe rule imposes higher risk based capital and leverage requirements than those in place at the time the rule was issued. Specifically, the rule imposes the following minimum capital requirements to be considered adequately capitalized:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA new common equity Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 4.5%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the previous 4% requirement);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous requirements); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA leverage ratio of 4%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rule also includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a transition period. These changes include the phasing out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Certain deferred tax assets over designated percentages of common stock are required to be deducted from capital, subject to a transition period. Finally, common equity Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities and all unrealized net gain or loss on defined benefit pension plan), subject to a transition period and a one-time opt-out election. The Bank elected to opt-out of this provision. As such, accumulated comprehensive income is not included in determining the Bank's regulatory capital ratios.\nThe rule also includes changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisitions, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital and increased risk weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for certain equity exposures.\nFinally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% (once fully phased in) of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements.\nThe final rule became effective on January 1, 2015, and the requirements in the rule will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. While the ultimate impact of the fully phased-in capital standards on the Company and the Bank continues to be reviewed, we currently do not believe that compliance with the Basel III Capital Rules will have a material impact once fully implemented.\nFor regulatory capital purposes as of March 31, 2015, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities) are excluded from regulatory capital, in addition to certain overall limits on net deferred tax assets as a percentage of common equity Tier 1 capital. At December 31, 2017, $1.2 million of the Bank's net deferred tax asset was excluded from common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total regulatory capital. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis for both financial reporting and regulatory capital purposes. This evaluation may result in the inclusion of a deferred tax asset in regulatory capital in an amount that is different from the amount determined under GAAP.\nIn addition, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total assets excluding intangibles. This measure is known as the leverage ratio. The current regulatory minimum for the leverage ratio for institutions to be considered well capitalized\u201d is 5%, but an individual institution could be required to maintain a higher level.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average tangible assets (as defined). At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had regulatory capital in excess of that required under each requirement and was classified as well capitalized\u201d.\nActual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank are presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

against an undercapitalized bank, the severity of which depends upon the bank's degree of capitalization. Failure to maintain an appropriate level of capital could cause the regulator to take any one or more of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company's customers, as well as to meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily.\nOur liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and investment securities, funds provided by operations and capital. Additionally, liquidity is provided through our portfolios of cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities available for sale. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by the Bank's competitors.\nThe borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines of credit, which totaled $22.3 million at December 31, 2017. Management notes that, historically, a small percentage of unused lines of credit are actually drawn down by customers within a 12-month period.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and assets that can be readily converted into cash, including interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, and investment securities. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.6 million in cash and due from banks, $10.0 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, and $89.3 million in investment securities available for sale.\nThe Bank also has external sources of funds through the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, which can be drawn upon when required. The Bank has a line of credit totaling approximately $97.5 million with the FHLB of which $32.4 million was available to be drawn on December 31, 2017 based on qualifying loans pledged as collateral. In addition, the Bank can pledge securities at the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB and, depending on the type of security, may\nborrow approximately 50% to 97% of the fair market value of the securities. The Bank had no securities pledged at the FHLB or Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2017.\nAdditionally, the Bank has unsecured federal funds lines of credit totaling $11.0 million with two institutions. The proceeds of the Company's line of credit may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017, there were outstanding balances of $20.0 million under the Bank's FHLB line and of $0 under the Company's other line of credit.\nTo further aid in managing liquidity, the Bank's Board of Directors has approved and formed an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) to review and discuss recommendations for the use of available cash and to maintain an investment portfolio. By limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture, management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short-term funding needs.\nWe believe the Bank has adequate cash on hand and available through liquidation of investment securities and available borrowing capacity to meet our liquidity needs. Although we believe sufficient liquidity exists, if economic conditions and consumer confidence deteriorate, this liquidity could be depleted, which would then materially affect our ability to meet operating needs and to raise additional capital.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nLoan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment.\nCurrently, we break-out our unfunded commitments into the following categories:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Construction Commitments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Commercial Lines of Credit and Other\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Home Equity LOC\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Demand Deposit Overdraft LOC\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommitted Loans Which Have Not Closed\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLetters of Credit\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, we revised the calculations for the following categories:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Commercial lines of credit and other - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's sole discretion on future funding of any specific account (customer must request funding and the Bank does not have to fund the request if we deem the account is no longer worthy of continued funding; we freeze all funding of accounts that are past due and/or in nonaccrual status.)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Home Equity LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's ability to freeze any account based on activity of the account or information which the Bank may obtain such as a drastic decline in collateral value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not change the calculations for the other categories even though we have similar rights as those categories above for the following reasons:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstructions Loans - we have the sole discretion to fund these requests, however not funding a construction request can have a material negative impact of our collateral value and therefore we will continue to allocate reserves for the unfunded amounts using the same loss ratio as the funded portion of the portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommitted Loans which have not closed - we have the sole discretion to not fund these loans should material adverse information become known to the Bank, however we are typically near the final stages of our due diligence underwriting of the loan and feel we have similar loss exposure as already funded loans therefore will continue to use the same loss ratio as funded loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLetters of Credit - in most instances, we must fund the Letter of Credit if such a request is made and do not have the sole discretion as we do for other categories.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank has accrued $24,334, a decrease of $460 from the $24,794 accrued as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities. The additional provision amount is included in \u2018other expense'.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nOur primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities in which the Bank engages, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on liabilities. Our interest rate risk represents the level of exposure we have to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical market value of equity that results from changes in interest rates. The ALCO oversees our management of interest rate risk. The objective of the management of interest rate risk is to maximize stockholder value, enhance profitability and increase capital, serve customer and community needs, and protect us from any material financial consequences associated with changes in interest rate risk.\nInterest rate risk is that risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate relationships across yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest rate related options embedded in certain bank products (option risk). Changes in interest rates may also affect a bank's underlying economic value. The value of a bank's assets, liabilities, and interest-rate related, off-balance sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is changed.\nWe believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary in order to achieve realistic profit goals. Management and the Board have chosen an interest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan.\nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by ALCO. The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology we employ. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products.\nWe prepare a current base case and up to eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and report the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions or strategy analysis so dictate.\nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for up to eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/ - 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in the current rate environment. It is our goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest-earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\nAt December 31, 2017, we were in an asset sensitive position over a one year measurement horizon. Management continuously strives to reduce higher costing fixed rate funding instruments, while increasing assets that are more fluid in their repricing. An asset sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a rising rate environment since more assets than liabilities will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates rise. Similarly, a liability sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a declining interest rate environment since more liabilities than assets will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates decline. Management works to maintain a consistent spread between yields on assets and costs of deposits and borrowings, regardless of the direction of interest rates.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStatic Balance Sheet/Immediate Change in Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEstimated Changes in Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`+200 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPolicy Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, measures of net interest income at risk were slightly less favorable at December 31, 2017 than at December 31, 2016 over a 12 month modelling period. All measures remained within prescribed policy limits. The primary contributor to the less favorable position was the less asset sensitive balance sheet.\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the\npresent value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStatic Balance Sheet/Immediate Change in Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEstimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity (EVE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n`+200 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPolicy Limit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe EVE at risk declined slightly at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016 in all interest rate shock levels. The Company's economic value of equity has a negative effect in both an increased and decreased interest rate environment because the liabilities reprice much slower than our assets, and our interest earning assets are much greater than our interest bearing liabilities. The Company's economic value of equity worsens in declining interest rate environments as the majority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease from their current levels thus the economic value of our liabilities and our assets both worsen in a declining rate environment i.e., given the current rate environment, down shocks may not be meaningful as market rates can only be shocked down to zero.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order to conform the previous year's financial statements to the current year's presentation. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates or judgments reflect management's view of the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our overall financial performance. Because these estimates or judgments are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experience. As such, changes in these estimates, judgments, and/or assumptions may have a significant impact on our financial statements. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is recorded and reported.\nWe have identified the following three policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex estimates or judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements, valuation of the securities portfolio and the accounting for income taxes. Management believes it has used the best information available to make the estimations or judgments necessary to value the related assets and liabilities. Actual performance that differs from estimates or judgments and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following is a discussion of the areas we view as our most critical accounting policies, including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe reserve for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the establishment of a reserve that is sufficient to absorb those losses. In determining an appropriate reserve, management makes numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates based on continuous review of the loan portfolio, estimates of client performance, collateral values, and disposition, as well as historical loss rates and expected cash flows. In assessing these factors, management benefits from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if management's underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the reserve for loan losses would have to be adjusted. Our accounting policy related to the reserve is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Available for sale securities and interest rate swap agreements are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of, or specific reserves against, individual assets. GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-driven or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market data. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market data, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and data are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques that require more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Fair value is discussed further in Note 1 under the heading Fair Value Measurements\u201d and in Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future.\nOther significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K. We have not substantively changed any aspect of our overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies.", "item_7_truncated": "We have identified the following three policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex estimates or judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.

The complex evaluations involved in such testing require significant estimates. Management uses available data to establish the allowance at a prudent level, recognizing that the determination is inherently subjective, and that future adjustments may be necessary, depending upon many items including a change in economic conditions affecting specific borrowers, or in general economic conditions, and new information that becomes available. However, there are no assurances that the allowance will be sufficient to absorb losses on nonperforming loans, or that the allowance will be sufficient to cover losses on nonperforming loans in the future.\nInterest rate risk is that risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate relationships across yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the\nThe Bank also has two federal funds lines of credit in the amounts of $5 million and $6 million, of which nothing was outstanding at December 1, 2017.\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBorrowings\n \u00b7 A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the previous 4% requirement); \n \u00b7 Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's sole discretion on future funding of any specific account (customer must request funding and the Bank does not have to fund the request if we deem the account is no longer worthy of continued funding; we freeze all funding of accounts that are past due and/or in nonaccrual status.) \n \u00b7 Unfunded Home Equity LOC \nWe use fair value measurements to record certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Available for sale securities and interest rate swap agreements are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of, or specific reserves against, individual assets. GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-driven or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data.\n \u00b7 changes in consumer confidence, spending and savings habits relative to the services we provide; \nTotal deposits were $334.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.3%, when compared to the $333.2 million recorded at December 31, 2016. Within the deposit base, noninterest bearing deposits balances increased $3.9 million, or 3.9%, interest bearing checking account balances decreased $0.6 million, or 2.2%, interest bearing savings account balances increased by $5.9 million, or 7.4%, money market balances increased $1.5 million, or 8.2%, and time deposit balances decreased by $9.7 million, or 9.2%, when compared to the amounts at December 31, 2016.\nWhen the probability for full payment of a loan is unlikely, the Bank will initiate a full charge-off or a partial write-down of the asset based upon the status of the loan. The following guidelines apply:\nNonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and real estate acquired through foreclosure, decreased to $3.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $4.1 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets represented 0.94% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2016. The level of nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to decreases in nonaccrual loans of $0.5 million. Management has worked diligently to identify borrowers that may be facing difficulties in order to restructure terms where appropriate, secure additional collateral or pursue foreclosure and other secondary sources of repayment.\nThe Bank experienced a $0.5 million or 11.7% decrease in the total nonperforming loans, as management has taken an aggressive approach to bring these impaired assets to resolution. The following table presents details of our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, as these asset quality metrics are evaluated by management, for the years indicated:\nThe EVE at risk declined slightly at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016 in all interest rate shock levels. The Company's economic value of equity has a negative effect in both an increased and decreased interest rate environment because the liabilities reprice much slower than our assets, and our interest earning assets are much greater than our interest bearing liabilities. The Company's economic value of equity worsens in declining interest rate environments as the majority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease from their current levels thus the economic value of our liabilities and our assets both worsen in a declining rate environment i.e., given the current rate environment, down shocks may not be meaningful as market rates can only be shocked down to zero.\n \u00b7 our obligation to fund commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit; \nYou should also carefully consider additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFinally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% (once fully phased in) of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements.\nThe composition of investment securities, at carrying value, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table:\n \u00b7 changes in laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might impact our ability to collect on outstanding loans or otherwise negatively impact our business; \nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.7 million compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.5 million, or a 4.6% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million for 2016 to $13.6 million for 2017, a $0.3 million, or a 2.45% increase, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans.\n (1) Yields are stated as book yields which are adjusted for amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts, respectively. \n \u00b7 the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; \nNet Interest Income. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Credit risk includes, but is not limited to, the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the Bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan. The Bank monitors its loan portfolio loan delinquencies monthly. All loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the Bank's portfolio as a group are evaluated. The Bank's management estimates an allowance for loan losses. Included in determining the calculation are such factors as historical losses for each loan portfolio, current market value of the loan's underlying collateral, inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy, economic trends, consideration of\n \u00b7 the impact of new laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might require changes to our business model; \nThe rule also includes changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisitions, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital and increased risk weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for certain equity exposures.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to individual loans that are classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and primarily includes nonaccrual and TDRs. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price, whichever is appropriate, of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan. For collateral-dependent impaired loans, any measured impairment is properly charged off against the loan and allowance in the applicable reporting period. The specific component may fluctuate from period to period if changes occur in the nature and volume of impaired loans.\nThe Bank's allowance for credit losses is based on the probable estimated losses that may be sustained in its loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and (2) ASC Topic 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe Bank uses borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Atlanta, of which it is a member, to supplement funding from deposits. The Bank's total credit availability is $97.5 million and it may draw $52.4 million which is secured by a floating lien on the Bank's residential first mortgage loans. There was a $10 million convertible\n \nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by ALCO. The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology we employ. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products.\nThe investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal obligations. The income from state and municipal obligations is exempt from federal income tax. State and municipal obligations from the State of Maryland are exempt from state income taxes. We use the investment portfolio as a source of both liquidity and earnings. Management continuously evaluates investment options that will produce income without assuming significant credit or interest rate risk and looks for opportunities to use liquidity from maturing investments to reduce our use of high cost time deposits and borrowed funds.\nWe prepare a current base case and up to eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and report the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions or strategy analysis so dictate.\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n________________________\n\nWe believe the Bank has adequate cash on hand and available through liquidation of investment securities and available borrowing capacity to meet our liquidity needs. Although we believe sufficient liquidity exists, if economic conditions and consumer confidence deteriorate, this liquidity could be depleted, which would then materially affect our ability to meet operating needs and to raise additional capital.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution for time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017:\n \u00b7 Letters of Credit \nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest rate related options embedded in certain bank products (option risk). Changes in interest rates may also affect a bank's underlying economic value. The value of a bank's assets, liabilities, and interest-rate related, off-balance sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is changed.\nFederal bank regulatory agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions against an undercapitalized bank, the severity of which depends upon the bank's degree of capitalization. Failure to maintain an appropriate level of capital could cause the regulator to take any one or more of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nThe Company's investment policy authorizes management to invest in traditional securities instruments in order to provide ongoing liquidity, income and a ready source of collateral that can be pledged in order to access other sources of funds. The investment portfolio consists mainly of securities available for sale. Securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability management strategy, liquidity management, interest rate risk management, regulatory capital management or other similar factors.\nOur current charge-off policy is as follows:\nAdditionally, the Bank has unsecured federal funds lines of credit totaling $11.0 million with two institutions. The proceeds of the Company's line of credit may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017, there were outstanding balances of $20.0 million under the Bank's FHLB line and of $0 under the Company's other line of credit.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCash\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n \u00b7 unexpected changes in market interest rates or monetary policy; \n \u00b7 Letters of Credit - in most instances, we must fund the Letter of Credit if such a request is made and do not have the sole discretion as we do for other categories. \nTotal assets increased by $1.1 million, or 0.26% to $389.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to the $388.4 million at December 31, 2016. Increases in cash, and loans, offset by a decrease in investment securities available for sale, were the reasons for the increase.\nIn July 2013, federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises their risk based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These Basel III Capital Rules were applicable to the Bank effective January 1, 2015, but they do not apply to the Company since it is a small bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in total consolidated assets. The Federal Reserve Board raised the threshold for the small bank holding company exclusion from $500 million to $1 billion in April 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made a provision of $0.3 million for loan losses, compared to a provision of $0.9 million for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Bank decreased its provision for credit losses compared to the prior period as specifically reserved, impaired loans were resolved. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses equaled 77.7% of nonaccrual and past due loans compared to 65.6% at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $0.2 million compared to $1.5 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank has accrued $24,334, a decrease of $460 from the $24,794 accrued as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities. The additional provision amount is included in \u2018other expense'.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\n \u00b7 the impact of pending and future legal proceedings; and \nFor regulatory capital purposes as of March 31, 2015, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities) are excluded from regulatory capital, in addition to certain overall limits on net deferred tax assets as a percentage of common equity Tier 1 capital. At December 31, 2017, $1.2 million of the Bank's net deferred tax asset was excluded from common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total regulatory capital. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis for both financial reporting and regulatory capital purposes. This evaluation may result in the inclusion of a deferred tax asset in regulatory capital in an amount that is different from the amount determined under GAAP.\nOther significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K. We have not substantively changed any aspect of our overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies.\nGeneral. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported consolidated net income of $0.9 million ($0.33 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $1.1 million ($0.40 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the 2017 consolidated net income was mainly due $0.6 million increase in tax expense due to the effect of the decrease in the federal tax rate on deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net income before taxes of $1.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in net income before taxes was an overall increase in interest income due to a larger volume of loans in 2017 compared to 2016, a lower provision for loan losses in 2017 compared to 2016, and a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in the volume of interest earning time deposits in 2017 compared to 2016. Annualized return on average assets was 0.23% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2016. Annualized return on average equity was 2.65% and 3.17% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The dividend payout ratio was 123.0% at December 31, 2017 compared to 101.0% at December 31, 2016. The equity to asset ratio was 8.74% and 8.71% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, repectively.\nThe pay-fixed swap executed November 1, 2017 is based on a $10 million notional amount, matures on 10/30/2022 (5 years) and has a floating received leg based on 3-month LIBOR. The Bank also entered into two forward starting swaps on the same date which will convert the two fixed rate $5 million borrowings maturing in July and August 2018 into fixed rates of 2.235% and 2.246%, respectively. The market value of the derivative contracts at December 31, 2017 was $48,809.\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.\nThe Company's loans, net of deferred fees and costs, increased by $6.4 million to $269.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $262.6 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to $79.9 million in new originations outpacing pay downs and a slowing in the pace of impaired loan resolutions. This change in the composition of the loan portfolio resulted primarily from the $20.1 million increase in indirect loans, consumer loans and commercial real estate, offset by $13.5 million decrease in residential real estate, commercial and industrial mortgages and construction loans.\nDeposits\n \u00b7 Unfunded Demand Deposit Overdraft LOC \nNet interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank's loans are residential and commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate, and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company's customers, as well as to meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily.\nStockholders' equity increased to $34.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2016. The $0.2 million, or 0.7%, increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $0.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and $0.1 million investment resulting from the Bank's dividend reinvestment plan, offset by $0.2 million decrease as a result of the $1.1 million or 123% of net income payout in dividends. The book value of the Company's common stock was $12.15 at December 31, 2017 and $12.13 at December 31, 2016.\n \u00b7 Any non-consumer unsecured loan more than 180 days delinquent in payment of principal and/or interest (or sooner if deemed uncollectible) is charged-off in full. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded net charge offs of $0.23 million, compared to net charge offs of $1.54 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Securities\nIn addition, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total assets excluding intangibles. This measure is known as the leverage ratio. The current regulatory minimum for the leverage ratio for institutions to be considered well capitalized\u201d is 5%, but an individual institution could be required to maintain a higher level.\n \u00b7 Unfunded Home Equity LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's ability to freeze any account based on activity of the account or information which the Bank may obtain such as a drastic decline in collateral value. \n \u00b7 changes in our sources and availability of liquidity; \n \u00b7 Generally, real estate secured loans are charged-off on a deficiency basis after liquidation of the collateral. In some cases, Bank management may determine that a charge-off or write-down is appropriate prior to liquidation of the collateral, when the full loan balance is clearly uncollectible and some loss is anticipated. In order to make this determination, an updated evaluation or appraisal of the property is obtained. \nThe Bank seeks to control delinquencies through diligent collection efforts. For consumer loans, the Bank sends out payment reminders on the seventh and twelfth days after a payment is due. If a consumer loan becomes 15 days past due, the account is transferred to the Bank's collections department, which will contact the borrower by telephone and/or letter before the account becomes 30 days past due. If a consumer loan becomes more than 30 days past due, the Bank will continue its collection efforts and will move to repossession or foreclosure by the 45th day if the Bank has reason to believe that the collateral may be in jeopardy or the borrower has failed to respond to prior communications. The Bank may move to repossess or foreclose in all instances in which a consumer loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. After repossession of a motor vehicle, the borrower has a 15-day statutory right to redeem the vehicle and is entitled to 10 days' notice before the sale of a repossessed vehicle. The Bank sells the vehicle as promptly as feasible after the expiration of these periods. If the amount realized from the sale of the vehicle is less than the loan amount, the Bank may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. The Bank follows similar collection procedures with respect to commercial loans.\n \u00b7 the ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of bank entities while controlling our costs; \nThe reserve for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the establishment of a reserve that is sufficient to absorb those losses. In determining an appropriate reserve, management makes numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates based on continuous review of the loan portfolio, estimates of client performance, collateral values, and disposition, as well as historical loss rates and expected cash flows. In assessing these factors, management benefits from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if management's underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the reserve for loan losses would have to be adjusted. Our accounting policy related to the reserve is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market data. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market data, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and data are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques that require more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Fair value is discussed further in Note 1 under the heading Fair Value Measurements\u201d and in Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d.\n \nparticular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectability.\nNoninterest Expenses. Other non-interest expenses decreased from $10.9 million in 2016 to $10.8 million in 2017, a $0.1 million or 0.53% decrease. Salary and employee benefits decreased by $0.04 million, or 0.76%, due to a decrease in overall salaries paid to employees in 2017 compared to 2016. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $0.1 million in 2017. The increase is due to software purchased by the Bank for several deparments in 2017. Legal, accounting and other professional fees increased from $0.8 million in 2016 to $0.9 million in 2016, a $0.1 million, or 18.23% increase. The increase was due to higher legal and accounting fees paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Data processing and item processing services decreased by $0.1 million, or 18.70%, to $0.6 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The decrease was due to the renegotiation of several services contracts in 2017. FDIC insurance costs decreased by $0.04 million, or 12.85%. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 107.69 %, from $0.1 million in 2016, to $0.2 in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in printing of marketing materials expenses. Loan collection costs decreased to $0.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.1 million, or 61.58% decrease. The decrease is due to a decrease in the amount of collection expenses paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Telephone cost increased by $0.1 million, or 43.75%, to $0.3 million in 2017 compared to $0.2 million in 2016. The increase was due to a new phone system purchased and implemented in 2017. Other expenses decreased to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.2 million, or 10.27% decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in ATM expenses and office supplies purchased in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTotal interest expense decreased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $1.9 million in 2017, a $0.2 million or an 8.76% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average deposits as well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.12% compared to 2.98% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by the Company's average interest-earning assets.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average tangible assets (as defined). At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had regulatory capital in excess of that required under each requirement and was classified as well capitalized\u201d.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities sold, and income on bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Noninterest income decreased from $1.6 million in 2016 to $1.3 million in 2017, a $0.3 million, or 18.67% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to $0.4 million decrease in other income due to a death benefit associated with BOLI recorded in 2016, partially offset by an overall $0.2 million increase in other fees and commissions.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loans' effective interest rates for loans that are not collateral dependent.\nThe following deposit table presents the composition of deposits at December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u00b7 continued relationships with major customers; \nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.9 million, compared to an income tax credit of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.0 million or 1,200.0% decrease. This increase was primarily due to $0.8 million higher income before taxes and $0.6 million tax expense associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the federal tax rate included in the Tax Reform Act.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nLoan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u00b7 Consumer loans less than $25,000 for which payments of principal and/or interest are past due ninety (90) days are charged-off and referred for collection. Loans over 120 days past due are evaluated for charge-off or partial write-down at the discretion of Bank management. \nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days as to either principal or interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of all interest and/or principal is in doubt. Placing a loan on nonaccrual status means that we no longer accrue interest on such loan and reverse any interest previously accrued but not collected. Management may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a 90 day past due loan that is both well secured and in the process of collection. An asset is well secured\u201d if it is secured by (1) collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is in the process of collection\u201d if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in prepayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan and remains current.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nAmple capital is necessary to sustain growth, provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in asset values and safeguard the funds of depositors. Capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and enables us to manage assets and liabilities effectively.\n \u00b7 Committed Loans which have not closed - we have the sole discretion to not fund these loans should material adverse information become known to the Bank, however we are typically near the final stages of our due diligence underwriting of the loan and feel we have similar loss exposure as already funded loans therefore will continue to use the same loss ratio as funded loans. \n \u00b7 higher than anticipated loan losses or the insufficiency of the allowance for credit losses; \n\n \u00b7 our ability to recover the fair values of available for sale securities; \nborrow approximately 50% to 97% of the fair market value of the securities. The Bank had no securities pledged at the FHLB or Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2017.\n\nThe following table provides information for the designated periods with respect to the average balances, income and expense and annualized yields and costs associated with various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n \u00b7 changes in competitive, governmental, regulatory, accounting, technological and other factors that may affect us specifically or the banking industry generally, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d); \n \u00b7 A leverage ratio of 4%. \nAt December 31, 2017, we were in an asset sensitive position over a one year measurement horizon. Management continuously strives to reduce higher costing fixed rate funding instruments, while increasing assets that are more fluid in their repricing. An asset sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a rising rate environment since more assets than liabilities will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates rise. Similarly, a liability sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a declining interest rate environment since more liabilities than assets will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates decline. Management works to maintain a consistent spread between yields on assets and costs of deposits and borrowings, regardless of the direction of interest rates.\n \u00b7 changes in our plans and strategies and the results thereof; \nOur liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and investment securities, funds provided by operations and capital. Additionally, liquidity is provided through our portfolios of cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities available for sale. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by the Bank's competitors.\nLIQUIDITY\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nLoans\n \u00b7 unexpected changes in the housing market, business markets, and/or general economic conditions in our market area, or a slower-than-anticipated economic recovery, which might lead to increased or decreased demand for loans, deposits and other products and services; \nTo further aid in managing liquidity, the Bank's Board of Directors has approved and formed an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) to review and discuss recommendations for the use of available cash and to maintain an investment portfolio. By limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture, management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short-term funding needs.\nThe rule imposes higher risk based capital and leverage requirements than those in place at the time the rule was issued. Specifically, the rule imposes the following minimum capital requirements to be considered adequately capitalized:\nThe rule also includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a transition period. These changes include the phasing out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Certain deferred tax assets over designated percentages of common stock are required to be deducted from capital, subject to a transition period. Finally, common equity Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities and all unrealized net gain or loss on defined benefit pension plan), subject to a transition period and a one-time opt-out election. The Bank elected to opt-out of this provision. As such, accumulated comprehensive income is not included in determining the Bank's regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.\nOur primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities in which the Bank engages, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on liabilities. Our interest rate risk represents the level of exposure we have to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical market value of equity that results from changes in interest rates. The ALCO oversees our management of interest rate risk. The objective of the management of interest rate risk is to maximize stockholder value, enhance profitability and increase capital, serve customer and community needs, and protect us from any material financial consequences associated with changes in interest rate risk.\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio, both by loan category and by fixed and adjustable rates, at December 31, 2017. Demand loans and loans, which have no stated maturity, are treated as due in one year or less.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include projections, predictions, expectations or statements as to beliefs or future events or results, or refer to other matters that are not purely statements of historical facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on various factors and were derived using numerous assumptions. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like may\u201d, will\u201d, should\u201d, expect\u201d, plan\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, believe\u201d, estimate\u201d, predict\u201d, potential\u201d, or continue\u201d or the negative of those words and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements reflect only our predictions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties should materialize, or if underlying assumptions should prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Further, factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statement s may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\n \u00b7 A new common equity Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 4.5%; \n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\n \u00b7 Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios. \nAs shown above, measures of net interest income at risk were slightly less favorable at December 31, 2017 than at December 31, 2016 over a 12 month modelling period. All measures remained within prescribed policy limits. The primary contributor to the less favorable position was the less asset sensitive balance sheet.\n \u00b7 A total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous requirements); and \nCurrently, we break-out our unfunded commitments into the following categories:\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established to estimate losses that may occur on loans by recording a provision for loan losses that is charged to earnings in the current period. The allowance is evaluated on at least a quarterly basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historic experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Measured impairment and credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan or a portion of the loan's balance is not collectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order to conform the previous year's financial statements to the current year's presentation. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates or judgments reflect management's view of the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our overall financial performance. Because these estimates or judgments are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experience. As such, changes in these estimates, judgments, and/or assumptions may have a significant impact on our financial statements. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is recorded and reported.\nThis section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of the Company through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2017, net interest income increased to $11.7 million from $11.2 million in 2016, a 4.59% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million in 2016 to $13.6 million in 2017, a 2.45% increase. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.9 million, an 8.76% decrease from $2.1 million in 2016. Due to the increase in tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Reform Act, net income decreased by $0.2 million to $0.9 million in 2017 compared to $1.1 million in 2016.\n \u00b7 Constructions Loans - we have the sole discretion to fund these requests, however not funding a construction request can have a material negative impact of our collateral value and therefore we will continue to allocate reserves for the unfunded amounts using the same loss ratio as the funded portion of the portfolio. \n \u00b7 our potential exposure to various types of market risks, such as interest rate risk and credit risk; \nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for up to eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/ - 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in the current rate environment. It is our goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest-earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\n\n Nonaccrual loans included in average balance. \nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had no investments in securities of a single issuer (other than the U.S. Government securities and securities of federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises), which aggregated more than 10% of stockholders' equity.\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\n \u00b7 losses that we may realize from off-balance sheet arrangements. \nThe final rule became effective on January 1, 2015, and the requirements in the rule will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. While the ultimate impact of the fully phased-in capital standards on the Company and the Bank continues to be reviewed, we currently do not believe that compliance with the Basel III Capital Rules will have a material impact once fully implemented.\nWe did not change the calculations for the other categories even though we have similar rights as those categories above for the following reasons:\n\nadvance with a 3.28% rate of interest that matured November 1, 2017. A variable rate (3-month LIBOR) $10 million borrowing was executed on November 1, 2017 to replace it, which was converted into a 2.105% fixed rate payment using a pay-fixed swap on the same date. There was a $5 million convertible advance that settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rate of interest and was callable quarterly, starting July 23, 2009. There was a $5 million convertible advance executed August 22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly, starting August 22, 2011.\nWe believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary in order to achieve realistic profit goals. Management and the Board have chosen an interest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan.", "item_7_text": "We have identified the following three policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex estimates or judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements, valuation of the securities portfolio and the accounting for income taxes. Management believes it has used the best information available to make the estimations or judgments necessary to value the related assets and liabilities. Actual performance that differs from estimates or judgments and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following is a discussion of the areas we view as our most critical accounting policies, including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and assets that can be readily converted into cash, including interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, and investment securities. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.6 million in cash and due from banks, $10.0 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, and $89.3 million in investment securities available for sale.\n\nThe general component covers pools of similar loans and is based upon historical loss experience of the Bank or peer bank group if the Bank's loss experience is deemed by management to be insufficient and several qualitative factors. These qualitative factors address various risk characteristics in the Bank's loan portfolio after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data. The general component may fluctuate from period to period if changes occur in the mix of the Bank's loan portfolio, economic conditions, or specific industry conditions.\nMaturities and weighted average yields for investment securities at December 31, 2017 are presented in the following table:\n \u00b7 Unfunded Commercial Lines of Credit and Other \nFair Value Measurements\nDuring 2015, we revised the calculations for the following categories:\n (2) Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis. \nThe Bank also has external sources of funds through the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, which can be drawn upon when required. The Bank has a line of credit totaling approximately $97.5 million with the FHLB of which $32.4 million was available to be drawn on December 31, 2017 based on qualifying loans pledged as collateral. In addition, the Bank can pledge securities at the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB and, depending on the type of security, may\n \u00b7 If secured, a charge-off is made to reduce the loan balance to a level equal to the anticipated liquidation value of the collateral when payment of principal and/or interest is more than 180 days delinquent, or prior to that if deemed uncollectible. \nThe funds needed by the Bank to make loans are primarily generated by deposit accounts solicited from the communities in Anne Arundel County. The Bank's deposit products include savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, demand deposit accounts, NOW checking accounts, IRA and SEP accounts, Holiday Club accounts and certificates of deposit. The Bank does not solicit brokered deposits. Variations in service charges, terms and interest rates are used to target specific markets. Ancillary products and services for deposit customers include safe deposit boxes, money orders, night depositories, automated clearinghouse transactions, wire transfers, ATMs, telephone banking and internet banking. The Bank is a member of the Cirrus(R), Star(R), Pulse(R) and MoneyPass(R) ATM networks.\nThe allowance was $2.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance as a percentage of total portfolio loans was 0.95% at December 31, 2017 and 0.94% at December 31, 2016.\n\n\nRestricted equity securities were $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u00b7 Committed Loans Which Have Not Closed \nActual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank are presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):\nRestricted Equity Securities\n \u00b7 competition from other financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits, and providing various financial services that may affect our profitability; \nA comparison of the loan portfolio for the years indicated is presented in the following table:\n\npresent value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.\n \u00b7 Unfunded Construction Commitments \n\nDuring 2017, the Company's investment securities portfolio totaled $89.3 million, a $5.3 million or 5.6%, decrease from $94.6 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by $19.5 million of net sales and redemption of investment securities, offset by $13.8 million of purchases and a 0.4 million increase in the market value of available for sale securities.\n\nThe borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines of credit, which totaled $22.3 million at December 31, 2017. Management notes that, historically, a small percentage of unused lines of credit are actually drawn down by customers within a 12-month period.\nThe following table reflects activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Credit Risk Management\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in Federal Funds at yearend 2017.\nA test of the adequacy of the allowance, using the methodology outlined above, is performed by management and reported to the Board of Directors on at least a quarterly basis. The complex evaluations involved in such testing require significant estimates. Management uses available data to establish the allowance at a prudent level, recognizing that the determination is inherently subjective, and that future adjustments may be necessary, depending upon many items including a change in economic conditions affecting specific borrowers, or in general economic conditions, and new information that becomes available. However, there are no assurances that the allowance will be sufficient to absorb losses on nonperforming loans, or that the allowance will be sufficient to cover losses on nonperforming loans in the future.\nInterest rate risk is that risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate relationships across yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the\nThe Bank also has two federal funds lines of credit in the amounts of $5 million and $6 million, of which nothing was outstanding at December 1, 2017.\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBorrowings\n \u00b7 A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the previous 4% requirement); \n \u00b7 Unfunded Commercial lines of credit and other - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's sole discretion on future funding of any specific account (customer must request funding and the Bank does not have to fund the request if we deem the account is no longer worthy of continued funding; we freeze all funding of accounts that are past due and/or in nonaccrual status.) \n \u00b7 Unfunded Home Equity LOC \nWe use fair value measurements to record certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Available for sale securities and interest rate swap agreements are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of, or specific reserves against, individual assets. GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-driven or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data.\n \u00b7 changes in consumer confidence, spending and savings habits relative to the services we provide; \nTotal deposits were $334.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.3%, when compared to the $333.2 million recorded at December 31, 2016. Within the deposit base, noninterest bearing deposits balances increased $3.9 million, or 3.9%, interest bearing checking account balances decreased $0.6 million, or 2.2%, interest bearing savings account balances increased by $5.9 million, or 7.4%, money market balances increased $1.5 million, or 8.2%, and time deposit balances decreased by $9.7 million, or 9.2%, when compared to the amounts at December 31, 2016.\nWhen the probability for full payment of a loan is unlikely, the Bank will initiate a full charge-off or a partial write-down of the asset based upon the status of the loan. The following guidelines apply:\nNonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and real estate acquired through foreclosure, decreased to $3.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $4.1 million at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets represented 0.94% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2016. The level of nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to decreases in nonaccrual loans of $0.5 million. Management has worked diligently to identify borrowers that may be facing difficulties in order to restructure terms where appropriate, secure additional collateral or pursue foreclosure and other secondary sources of repayment.\nThe Bank experienced a $0.5 million or 11.7% decrease in the total nonperforming loans, as management has taken an aggressive approach to bring these impaired assets to resolution. The following table presents details of our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, as these asset quality metrics are evaluated by management, for the years indicated:\nThe EVE at risk declined slightly at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016 in all interest rate shock levels. The Company's economic value of equity has a negative effect in both an increased and decreased interest rate environment because the liabilities reprice much slower than our assets, and our interest earning assets are much greater than our interest bearing liabilities. The Company's economic value of equity worsens in declining interest rate environments as the majority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease from their current levels thus the economic value of our liabilities and our assets both worsen in a declining rate environment i.e., given the current rate environment, down shocks may not be meaningful as market rates can only be shocked down to zero.\n \u00b7 our obligation to fund commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit; \nYou should also carefully consider additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFinally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% (once fully phased in) of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements.\nThe composition of investment securities, at carrying value, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table:\n \u00b7 changes in laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might impact our ability to collect on outstanding loans or otherwise negatively impact our business; \nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.7 million compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $0.5 million, or a 4.6% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million for 2016 to $13.6 million for 2017, a $0.3 million, or a 2.45% increase, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans.\n (1) Yields are stated as book yields which are adjusted for amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts, respectively. \n \u00b7 the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; \nNet Interest Income. The primary component of the Company's net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Credit risk includes, but is not limited to, the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the Bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan. The Bank monitors its loan portfolio loan delinquencies monthly. All loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the Bank's portfolio as a group are evaluated. The Bank's management estimates an allowance for loan losses. Included in determining the calculation are such factors as historical losses for each loan portfolio, current market value of the loan's underlying collateral, inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy, economic trends, consideration of\n \u00b7 the impact of new laws, regulations and governmental policies and guidelines that might require changes to our business model; \nThe rule also includes changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisitions, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital and increased risk weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for certain equity exposures.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to individual loans that are classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and primarily includes nonaccrual and TDRs. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price, whichever is appropriate, of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan. For collateral-dependent impaired loans, any measured impairment is properly charged off against the loan and allowance in the applicable reporting period. The specific component may fluctuate from period to period if changes occur in the nature and volume of impaired loans.\nThe Bank's allowance for credit losses is based on the probable estimated losses that may be sustained in its loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and (2) ASC Topic 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan\u201d, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe Bank uses borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Atlanta, of which it is a member, to supplement funding from deposits. The Bank's total credit availability is $97.5 million and it may draw $52.4 million which is secured by a floating lien on the Bank's residential first mortgage loans. There was a $10 million convertible\n \nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by ALCO. The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S. Treasury interest rates. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology we employ. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products.\nThe investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal obligations. The income from state and municipal obligations is exempt from federal income tax. State and municipal obligations from the State of Maryland are exempt from state income taxes. We use the investment portfolio as a source of both liquidity and earnings. Management continuously evaluates investment options that will produce income without assuming significant credit or interest rate risk and looks for opportunities to use liquidity from maturing investments to reduce our use of high cost time deposits and borrowed funds.\nWe prepare a current base case and up to eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and report the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions or strategy analysis so dictate.\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n________________________\n\nWe believe the Bank has adequate cash on hand and available through liquidation of investment securities and available borrowing capacity to meet our liquidity needs. Although we believe sufficient liquidity exists, if economic conditions and consumer confidence deteriorate, this liquidity could be depleted, which would then materially affect our ability to meet operating needs and to raise additional capital.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution for time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017:\n \u00b7 Letters of Credit \nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest rate related options embedded in certain bank products (option risk). Changes in interest rates may also affect a bank's underlying economic value. The value of a bank's assets, liabilities, and interest-rate related, off-balance sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is changed.\nFederal bank regulatory agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions against an undercapitalized bank, the severity of which depends upon the bank's degree of capitalization. Failure to maintain an appropriate level of capital could cause the regulator to take any one or more of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nThe Company's investment policy authorizes management to invest in traditional securities instruments in order to provide ongoing liquidity, income and a ready source of collateral that can be pledged in order to access other sources of funds. The investment portfolio consists mainly of securities available for sale. Securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability management strategy, liquidity management, interest rate risk management, regulatory capital management or other similar factors.\nOur current charge-off policy is as follows:\nAdditionally, the Bank has unsecured federal funds lines of credit totaling $11.0 million with two institutions. The proceeds of the Company's line of credit may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017, there were outstanding balances of $20.0 million under the Bank's FHLB line and of $0 under the Company's other line of credit.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCash\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n \u00b7 unexpected changes in market interest rates or monetary policy; \n \u00b7 Letters of Credit - in most instances, we must fund the Letter of Credit if such a request is made and do not have the sole discretion as we do for other categories. \nTotal assets increased by $1.1 million, or 0.26% to $389.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to the $388.4 million at December 31, 2016. Increases in cash, and loans, offset by a decrease in investment securities available for sale, were the reasons for the increase.\nIn July 2013, federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises their risk based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These Basel III Capital Rules were applicable to the Bank effective January 1, 2015, but they do not apply to the Company since it is a small bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in total consolidated assets. The Federal Reserve Board raised the threshold for the small bank holding company exclusion from $500 million to $1 billion in April 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made a provision of $0.3 million for loan losses, compared to a provision of $0.9 million for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Bank decreased its provision for credit losses compared to the prior period as specifically reserved, impaired loans were resolved. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses equaled 77.7% of nonaccrual and past due loans compared to 65.6% at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $0.2 million compared to $1.5 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank has accrued $24,334, a decrease of $460 from the $24,794 accrued as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities. The additional provision amount is included in \u2018other expense'.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\n \u00b7 the impact of pending and future legal proceedings; and \nFor regulatory capital purposes as of March 31, 2015, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities) are excluded from regulatory capital, in addition to certain overall limits on net deferred tax assets as a percentage of common equity Tier 1 capital. At December 31, 2017, $1.2 million of the Bank's net deferred tax asset was excluded from common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total regulatory capital. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis for both financial reporting and regulatory capital purposes. This evaluation may result in the inclusion of a deferred tax asset in regulatory capital in an amount that is different from the amount determined under GAAP.\nOther significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K. We have not substantively changed any aspect of our overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies.\nGeneral. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported consolidated net income of $0.9 million ($0.33 basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $1.1 million ($0.40 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the 2017 consolidated net income was mainly due $0.6 million increase in tax expense due to the effect of the decrease in the federal tax rate on deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net income before taxes of $1.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the increase in net income before taxes was an overall increase in interest income due to a larger volume of loans in 2017 compared to 2016, a lower provision for loan losses in 2017 compared to 2016, and a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in the volume of interest earning time deposits in 2017 compared to 2016. Annualized return on average assets was 0.23% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2016. Annualized return on average equity was 2.65% and 3.17% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The dividend payout ratio was 123.0% at December 31, 2017 compared to 101.0% at December 31, 2016. The equity to asset ratio was 8.74% and 8.71% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, repectively.\nThe pay-fixed swap executed November 1, 2017 is based on a $10 million notional amount, matures on 10/30/2022 (5 years) and has a floating received leg based on 3-month LIBOR. The Bank also entered into two forward starting swaps on the same date which will convert the two fixed rate $5 million borrowings maturing in July and August 2018 into fixed rates of 2.235% and 2.246%, respectively. The market value of the derivative contracts at December 31, 2017 was $48,809.\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.\nThe Company's loans, net of deferred fees and costs, increased by $6.4 million to $269.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $262.6 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to $79.9 million in new originations outpacing pay downs and a slowing in the pace of impaired loan resolutions. This change in the composition of the loan portfolio resulted primarily from the $20.1 million increase in indirect loans, consumer loans and commercial real estate, offset by $13.5 million decrease in residential real estate, commercial and industrial mortgages and construction loans.\nDeposits\n \u00b7 Unfunded Demand Deposit Overdraft LOC \nNet interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. Currently a majority of the Bank's loans are residential and commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate, and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles.\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company's customers, as well as to meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily.\nStockholders' equity increased to $34.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2016. The $0.2 million, or 0.7%, increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $0.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and $0.1 million investment resulting from the Bank's dividend reinvestment plan, offset by $0.2 million decrease as a result of the $1.1 million or 123% of net income payout in dividends. The book value of the Company's common stock was $12.15 at December 31, 2017 and $12.13 at December 31, 2016.\n \u00b7 Any non-consumer unsecured loan more than 180 days delinquent in payment of principal and/or interest (or sooner if deemed uncollectible) is charged-off in full. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded net charge offs of $0.23 million, compared to net charge offs of $1.54 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Securities\nIn addition, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total assets excluding intangibles. This measure is known as the leverage ratio. The current regulatory minimum for the leverage ratio for institutions to be considered well capitalized\u201d is 5%, but an individual institution could be required to maintain a higher level.\n \u00b7 Unfunded Home Equity LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios and the Bank's ability to freeze any account based on activity of the account or information which the Bank may obtain such as a drastic decline in collateral value. \n \u00b7 changes in our sources and availability of liquidity; \n \u00b7 Generally, real estate secured loans are charged-off on a deficiency basis after liquidation of the collateral. In some cases, Bank management may determine that a charge-off or write-down is appropriate prior to liquidation of the collateral, when the full loan balance is clearly uncollectible and some loss is anticipated. In order to make this determination, an updated evaluation or appraisal of the property is obtained. \nThe Bank seeks to control delinquencies through diligent collection efforts. For consumer loans, the Bank sends out payment reminders on the seventh and twelfth days after a payment is due. If a consumer loan becomes 15 days past due, the account is transferred to the Bank's collections department, which will contact the borrower by telephone and/or letter before the account becomes 30 days past due. If a consumer loan becomes more than 30 days past due, the Bank will continue its collection efforts and will move to repossession or foreclosure by the 45th day if the Bank has reason to believe that the collateral may be in jeopardy or the borrower has failed to respond to prior communications. The Bank may move to repossess or foreclose in all instances in which a consumer loan becomes more than 60 days delinquent. After repossession of a motor vehicle, the borrower has a 15-day statutory right to redeem the vehicle and is entitled to 10 days' notice before the sale of a repossessed vehicle. The Bank sells the vehicle as promptly as feasible after the expiration of these periods. If the amount realized from the sale of the vehicle is less than the loan amount, the Bank may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. The Bank follows similar collection procedures with respect to commercial loans.\n \u00b7 the ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of bank entities while controlling our costs; \nThe reserve for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the establishment of a reserve that is sufficient to absorb those losses. In determining an appropriate reserve, management makes numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates based on continuous review of the loan portfolio, estimates of client performance, collateral values, and disposition, as well as historical loss rates and expected cash flows. In assessing these factors, management benefits from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if management's underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the reserve for loan losses would have to be adjusted. Our accounting policy related to the reserve is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market data. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market data, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and data are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques that require more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Fair value is discussed further in Note 1 under the heading Fair Value Measurements\u201d and in Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d.\n \nparticular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectability.\nNoninterest Expenses. Other non-interest expenses decreased from $10.9 million in 2016 to $10.8 million in 2017, a $0.1 million or 0.53% decrease. Salary and employee benefits decreased by $0.04 million, or 0.76%, due to a decrease in overall salaries paid to employees in 2017 compared to 2016. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $0.1 million in 2017. The increase is due to software purchased by the Bank for several deparments in 2017. Legal, accounting and other professional fees increased from $0.8 million in 2016 to $0.9 million in 2016, a $0.1 million, or 18.23% increase. The increase was due to higher legal and accounting fees paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Data processing and item processing services decreased by $0.1 million, or 18.70%, to $0.6 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The decrease was due to the renegotiation of several services contracts in 2017. FDIC insurance costs decreased by $0.04 million, or 12.85%. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 107.69 %, from $0.1 million in 2016, to $0.2 in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in printing of marketing materials expenses. Loan collection costs decreased to $0.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.1 million, or 61.58% decrease. The decrease is due to a decrease in the amount of collection expenses paid in 2017 compared to 2016. Telephone cost increased by $0.1 million, or 43.75%, to $0.3 million in 2017 compared to $0.2 million in 2016. The increase was due to a new phone system purchased and implemented in 2017. Other expenses decreased to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2016, a $0.2 million, or 10.27% decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in ATM expenses and office supplies purchased in 2017 compared to 2016.\nTotal interest expense decreased from $2.1 million in 2016 to $1.9 million in 2017, a $0.2 million or an 8.76% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in average deposits as well as a decrease in our cost of deposits. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.12% compared to 2.98% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by the Company's average interest-earning assets.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average tangible assets (as defined). At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had regulatory capital in excess of that required under each requirement and was classified as well capitalized\u201d.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and commissions, net gains on investment securities sold, and income on bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Noninterest income decreased from $1.6 million in 2016 to $1.3 million in 2017, a $0.3 million, or 18.67% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to $0.4 million decrease in other income due to a death benefit associated with BOLI recorded in 2016, partially offset by an overall $0.2 million increase in other fees and commissions.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loans' effective interest rates for loans that are not collateral dependent.\nThe following deposit table presents the composition of deposits at December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n \u00b7 continued relationships with major customers; \nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.9 million, compared to an income tax credit of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.0 million or 1,200.0% decrease. This increase was primarily due to $0.8 million higher income before taxes and $0.6 million tax expense associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the federal tax rate included in the Tax Reform Act.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nLoan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under development. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \u00b7 Consumer loans less than $25,000 for which payments of principal and/or interest are past due ninety (90) days are charged-off and referred for collection. Loans over 120 days past due are evaluated for charge-off or partial write-down at the discretion of Bank management. \nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days as to either principal or interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of all interest and/or principal is in doubt. Placing a loan on nonaccrual status means that we no longer accrue interest on such loan and reverse any interest previously accrued but not collected. Management may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a 90 day past due loan that is both well secured and in the process of collection. An asset is well secured\u201d if it is secured by (1) collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is in the process of collection\u201d if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in prepayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan and remains current.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nAmple capital is necessary to sustain growth, provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in asset values and safeguard the funds of depositors. Capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and enables us to manage assets and liabilities effectively.\n \u00b7 Committed Loans which have not closed - we have the sole discretion to not fund these loans should material adverse information become known to the Bank, however we are typically near the final stages of our due diligence underwriting of the loan and feel we have similar loss exposure as already funded loans therefore will continue to use the same loss ratio as funded loans. \n \u00b7 higher than anticipated loan losses or the insufficiency of the allowance for credit losses; \n\n \u00b7 our ability to recover the fair values of available for sale securities; \nborrow approximately 50% to 97% of the fair market value of the securities. The Bank had no securities pledged at the FHLB or Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2017.\n\nThe following table provides information for the designated periods with respect to the average balances, income and expense and annualized yields and costs associated with various categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n \u00b7 changes in competitive, governmental, regulatory, accounting, technological and other factors that may affect us specifically or the banking industry generally, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d); \n \u00b7 A leverage ratio of 4%. \nAt December 31, 2017, we were in an asset sensitive position over a one year measurement horizon. Management continuously strives to reduce higher costing fixed rate funding instruments, while increasing assets that are more fluid in their repricing. An asset sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a rising rate environment since more assets than liabilities will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates rise. Similarly, a liability sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a declining interest rate environment since more liabilities than assets will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates decline. Management works to maintain a consistent spread between yields on assets and costs of deposits and borrowings, regardless of the direction of interest rates.\n \u00b7 changes in our plans and strategies and the results thereof; \nOur liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and investment securities, funds provided by operations and capital. Additionally, liquidity is provided through our portfolios of cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities available for sale. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by the Bank's competitors.\nLIQUIDITY\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nLoans\n \u00b7 unexpected changes in the housing market, business markets, and/or general economic conditions in our market area, or a slower-than-anticipated economic recovery, which might lead to increased or decreased demand for loans, deposits and other products and services; \nTo further aid in managing liquidity, the Bank's Board of Directors has approved and formed an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) to review and discuss recommendations for the use of available cash and to maintain an investment portfolio. By limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture, management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short-term funding needs.\nThe rule imposes higher risk based capital and leverage requirements than those in place at the time the rule was issued. Specifically, the rule imposes the following minimum capital requirements to be considered adequately capitalized:\nThe rule also includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a transition period. These changes include the phasing out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Certain deferred tax assets over designated percentages of common stock are required to be deducted from capital, subject to a transition period. Finally, common equity Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities and all unrealized net gain or loss on defined benefit pension plan), subject to a transition period and a one-time opt-out election. The Bank elected to opt-out of this provision. As such, accumulated comprehensive income is not included in determining the Bank's regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in volume. Changes due to rate/volume are allocated to changes due to volume.\nOur primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities in which the Bank engages, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on liabilities. Our interest rate risk represents the level of exposure we have to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical market value of equity that results from changes in interest rates. The ALCO oversees our management of interest rate risk. The objective of the management of interest rate risk is to maximize stockholder value, enhance profitability and increase capital, serve customer and community needs, and protect us from any material financial consequences associated with changes in interest rate risk.\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio, both by loan category and by fixed and adjustable rates, at December 31, 2017. Demand loans and loans, which have no stated maturity, are treated as due in one year or less.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include projections, predictions, expectations or statements as to beliefs or future events or results, or refer to other matters that are not purely statements of historical facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on various factors and were derived using numerous assumptions. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like may\u201d, will\u201d, should\u201d, expect\u201d, plan\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, believe\u201d, estimate\u201d, predict\u201d, potential\u201d, or continue\u201d or the negative of those words and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements reflect only our predictions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties should materialize, or if underlying assumptions should prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Further, factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statement s may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\n \u00b7 A new common equity Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 4.5%; \n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\n \u00b7 Unfunded Demand Deposit overdraft LOC - reduce reserve percentage to zero based on historical loss ratios. \nAs shown above, measures of net interest income at risk were slightly less favorable at December 31, 2017 than at December 31, 2016 over a 12 month modelling period. All measures remained within prescribed policy limits. The primary contributor to the less favorable position was the less asset sensitive balance sheet.\n \u00b7 A total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous requirements); and \nCurrently, we break-out our unfunded commitments into the following categories:\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established to estimate losses that may occur on loans by recording a provision for loan losses that is charged to earnings in the current period. The allowance is evaluated on at least a quarterly basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historic experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Measured impairment and credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan or a portion of the loan's balance is not collectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order to conform the previous year's financial statements to the current year's presentation. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates or judgments reflect management's view of the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our overall financial performance. Because these estimates or judgments are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experience. As such, changes in these estimates, judgments, and/or assumptions may have a significant impact on our financial statements. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is recorded and reported.\nThis section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of the Company through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2017, net interest income increased to $11.7 million from $11.2 million in 2016, a 4.59% increase. Total interest income increased from $13.3 million in 2016 to $13.6 million in 2017, a 2.45% increase. Interest expense for 2017 totaled $1.9 million, an 8.76% decrease from $2.1 million in 2016. Due to the increase in tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Reform Act, net income decreased by $0.2 million to $0.9 million in 2017 compared to $1.1 million in 2016.\n \u00b7 Constructions Loans - we have the sole discretion to fund these requests, however not funding a construction request can have a material negative impact of our collateral value and therefore we will continue to allocate reserves for the unfunded amounts using the same loss ratio as the funded portion of the portfolio. \n \u00b7 our potential exposure to various types of market risks, such as interest rate risk and credit risk; \nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for up to eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/ - 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in the current rate environment. It is our goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest-earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\n\n Nonaccrual loans included in average balance. \nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had no investments in securities of a single issuer (other than the U.S. Government securities and securities of federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises), which aggregated more than 10% of stockholders' equity.\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\n \u00b7 losses that we may realize from off-balance sheet arrangements. \nThe final rule became effective on January 1, 2015, and the requirements in the rule will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. While the ultimate impact of the fully phased-in capital standards on the Company and the Bank continues to be reviewed, we currently do not believe that compliance with the Basel III Capital Rules will have a material impact once fully implemented.\nWe did not change the calculations for the other categories even though we have similar rights as those categories above for the following reasons:\n\nadvance with a 3.28% rate of interest that matured November 1, 2017. A variable rate (3-month LIBOR) $10 million borrowing was executed on November 1, 2017 to replace it, which was converted into a 2.105% fixed rate payment using a pay-fixed swap on the same date. There was a $5 million convertible advance that settled July 21, 2008 with a final maturity of July 23, 2018. This advance has a 2.73% rate of interest and was callable quarterly, starting July 23, 2009. There was a $5 million convertible advance executed August 22, 2008 which has a final maturity of August 22, 2018. This advance has a 3.34% rate of interest and is callable quarterly, starting August 22, 2011.\nWe believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary in order to achieve realistic profit goals. Management and the Board have chosen an interest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan.", "item_7_tables": "Table 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Net interest income increased to $11.7 million in 2017 from $11.2 million in 2016, a 4.59% increase. This was driven by higher interest income from a larger volume of loans, partially offset by lower interest expense due to decreased interest-bearing deposits.\n\n2. Net income decreased to $0.9 million in 2017 from $1.1 million in 2016. This was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets under the Tax Reform Act. \n\n3. Total loans increased by $6.4 million or 2.4% in 2017, largely due to growth in indirect, consumer, and commercial real estate loans. Total deposits increased slightly by $1.0 million or 0.3%.\n\n4. The allowance for loan losses was $2.6 million at December 31, 2017, equal to 0.95% of total loans. Net charge-offs declined from $1.5 million in 2016 to $0.2 million in 2017. \n\n5. Nonperforming assets decreased from $4.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $3.7 million at December 31, 2017, mainly due to decreases in nonaccrual loans.\n\n6. Stockholders' equity increased slightly by $0.2 million in 2017. The dividend payout ratio was 123.0% for 2017 compared to 101.0% for 2016.\n\nIn summary, loan growth and higher net interest income contributed to earnings in 2017, but this was mostly offset by higher tax expense. Credit quality continued to improve as reflected in lower net charge-offs and nonperforming assets. Capital levels remained steady with a slight increase in stockholders' equity."}
