Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2016, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues and Expenses\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing, among other films. Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Justice League, Spider Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Thor: Ragnarok, The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman, and The Lego Batman Movie, among other films.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues. We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily include utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate. We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations. In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.\nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>actual theatre level cash flows; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>budgeted theatre level cash flows; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>theatre property and equipment carrying values; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>amortizing intangible asset carrying values; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the age of a recently built theatre; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>competitive theatres in the marketplace; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the impact of recent ticket price changes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>available lease renewal options; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for fee owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016. The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment (\u201cASU 2011-08\u201d). The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment. The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. During 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company's tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for all indefinite-lived tradename assets other than our tradename in Ecuador, for which we performed a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company's historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we also performed a test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013. We recently rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations. We estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.\nIncome Taxes\nWe participate in the consolidated return of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. However, our provision for income taxes is computed on a stand-alone basis. We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company's theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company's sale of certain of its shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,

Facility lease expense increased to $80.6 million ($91.8 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $80.3 million for the 2015 period. The as reported increase was due to increased percentage rent expense as a result of increased constant currency revenues and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $105.0 million ($123.4 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $104.0 million for 2015. The as reported increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs, increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, increased repairs and maintenance expenses and increased janitorial services, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $140.6 million for 2016 from $154.1 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased salaries and incentive compensation expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $209.1 million for 2016 compared to $189.2 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres as well as remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $2.8 million for 2016 compared to $8.8 million for 2015. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting eight of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $20.4 million during 2016 compared to $8.1 million during 2015. The loss recorded during the 2016 period was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 4) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $108.3 million for 2016 compared to $112.7 million for 2015. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the \u201c7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016, as well as the amendments in June and December of 2016 to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss). We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $16.8 million during 2015 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes and the amendments, in June and December of 2016, to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to an amendment to our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $14.7 million during 2016 and $18.1 million during 2015, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $32.0 million during 2016 and $28.1 million during 2015. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $104.9 million was recorded for 2016 compared to $130.0 million recorded for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.9%, which included the impact of the implementation of a foreign holding and financing structure that will allow us to use foreign tax credits that had previously carried a full valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nRevenues.

The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films leading to stronger box office performance during the 2015 period. The 2015 period included such blockbuster releases as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Furious 7, American Sniper, Inside Out and Minions, which grossed in excess of $900 million, $650 million, $450 million, $350 million, $350 million, $350 million and $325 million, respectively.

The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations and increased local currency wage rates. Facility lease expense decreased to $80.3 million (increased to $99.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $81.9 for 2014. The as reported decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $104.0 million ($129.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $98.3 million for 2014. The as reported increase was due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses, utility expenses and new theatres.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $154.1 million for 2015 from $148.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation expense and share based awards compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $189.2 million for 2015 compared to $175.7 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres and remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $8.8 million for 2015 compared to $6.6 million for 2014. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2014 consisted primarily of U.S. theatre properties, impacting twelve of our twenty-six reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $8.1 million during 2015 compared to $15.7 million during 2014. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S. The loss recorded during 2014 was primarily due to the retirement of certain theatre equipment that was replaced during the period, lease termination charges recorded for theatre closures and a charge for termination of a vendor contract.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $112.7 million for 2015 compared to $113.7 million for 2014. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Loss. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $16.8 million during 2015 and $6.2 million during 2014 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to the amendment of our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $18.1 million during 2015 and $18.5 million during 2014, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. NCM did not distribute any excess cash during the second quarter of 2015 due to expenses incurred as the result of the termination of a proposed merger. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $28.1 million during 2015 and $22.7 million during 2014. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $130.0 million was recorded for 2015 compared to $97.2 million recorded for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of items related to our Mexican subsidiaries. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating Activities\nWe primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. In addition, nearly all of our theatres also provide the patron a choice of using a credit card, debit card or advanced-sale type certificates such as a gift card. Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating \u201cfloat\u201d and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $454.1 million, $455.2 million, and $451.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $253.3 million, $328.1 million and $327.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>New\nTheatres </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Existing\nTheatres (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td>The amount for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had an average of 33 and 89 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.\nOur U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres with 4,559 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built six new theatres and 69 screens, acquired four theatres with 52 screens and closed eight theatres with 80 screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open three new theatres and 30 screens in domestic markets during 2017 and open six new theatres with 71 screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 101 domestic screens will be approximately $61 million.\nOur international theatre circuit consisted of 187 theatres with 1,344 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built twelve new theatres and 75 screens and closed one theatre with nine screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open five new theatres and 39 screens in international markets during 2017 and open one theatre and five screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 44 international screens will be approximately $18 million.\nActual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities was $146.3 million, $150.5 million, and $152.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds from the issuance of a $225.0 million add-on to our existing 4.875% Senior Notes as well as associated debt issue costs. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>663.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>530.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>755.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 5.125% senior notes due 2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc. 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,814.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,823.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal long-term debt, less current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,806.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,817.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Debt issuance costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, less current portion, net of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,772.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,782.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2016, we had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit line.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt obligations, scheduled interest payments on long-term debt, future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, scheduled interest payments under capital leases and other obligations for each period indicated are summarized as follows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 -

Subsequent to the amendment, quarterly principal payments in the amount of $1.8 million were due on the term loan through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $6.9 million in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 16, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. made a pre-payment of $13.5 million on its term loan using the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of RealD (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, subsequent to the prepayment, quarterly payments in the amount of $1.4 million are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the pre-payment.\nOn June 13, 2016 and December 15, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its Credit Agreement to reduce the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.25% and then an additional 0.50%, respectively. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.5 million in connection with these amendments, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest on the term loan accrues at Cinemark USA, Inc.'s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nCinemark USA, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and the guarantors' personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.'s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries' and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nThe dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.'s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,390.4 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the agreement.\nAt December 31, 2016, there was $663.8 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had no borrowings under the revolving credit line during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2016. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.0% per annum.\n4.875% Senior Notes\nOn May 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $530.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, at par value, (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023.\nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes, at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015. Proceeds, after payment of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc.'s previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021 (the \u201c7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as Cinemark USA, Inc.'s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. The aggregate principal amount of $755.0 million of 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.7 million in connection with the issuance of the additional notes, which, along with the discount of $2.3 million, are reflected as a reduction of long term debt, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nOn April 5, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. and its guarantor subsidiaries filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), pursuant to which Cinemark USA, Inc. offered to exchange the additional 4.875% Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights. The registration statement was declared effective April 18, 2016, and the notes were exchanged on May 17, 2016.\nThe 4.875% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s or a guarantor's debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.'s Credit Agreement. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 4.875% Senior Notes.\nThe indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,261.8 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 4.875% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 6.3 to 1.\nPrior to June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 4.875% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes to the date of redemption. After June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 4.875% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture.\n5.125% Senior Notes\nOn December 18, 2012, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2022, at par value (the \u201c5.125% Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2022.\nThe 5.125% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s or a guarantor's debt. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future subordinated debt. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.'s Credit Agreement. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 5.125% Senior Notes.\nThe indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,266.5 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 6.4 to 1.\nPrior to December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 5.125% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium. After December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 5.125% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices described in the 5.125% Senior Notes. In addition, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.125% Senior Notes from the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the 5.125% Senior Notes.\n7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\nOn June 3, 2011, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021, at par value (the \u201cSenior Subordinated Notes\u201d).\nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed its Senior Subordinated Notes at a make-whole premium of approximately 104% plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the additional $225.0 million Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above. As a result of the redemption, the Company wrote-off approximately $2.4 million in unamortized debt issue costs, paid a make-whole premium of $9.4 million and paid other fees of $1.2 million, all of which are reflected in loss on debt amendments and refinancing during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCovenant Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2016, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.\nRatings\nWe are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity. The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency's evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency's judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time. A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds. Below are our current credit ratings.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>Standard and Poor's </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc.

The purpose of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.

Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the amendments within these accounting standards updates in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates on our consolidated financial statements, specifically with respect to our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM, loyalty program accounting, breakage income for stored value cards as well as other ancillary and contractual revenues.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs. ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.

The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted.

The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-07 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Prospective, retrospective, or modified retrospective application may be used dependent on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09. We will adopt ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the first interim period of 2017. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share based awards will be recognized as discrete items in the income statement during the period in which they occur. We will continue to estimate forfeitures for our share based awards after adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-15\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d).

ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A modified retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-16 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Specifically, ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-18 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, (\u201cASU 2017-01\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.

The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.\nSeasonality\nOur revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.", "item_7_truncated": "On December 18, 2012, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2022, at par value (the \u201c5.125% Senior Notes\u201d).

Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d).

theatre circuit consisted of 187 theatres with 1,344 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built twelve new theatres and 75 screens and closed one theatre with nine screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open five new theatres and 39 screens in international markets during 2017 and open one theatre and five screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 44 international screens will be approximately $18 million.\n (1) We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, which results in a more clear presentation of film rental and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $19.6 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other. \nTable 52:

distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $8.8 million for 2015 compared to $6.6 million for 2014. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2014 consisted primarily of U.S. theatre properties, impacting twelve of our twenty-six reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.

General and administrative expenses increased to $154.1 million for 2015 from $148.6 million for 2014.

We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $16.8 million during 2015 and $6.2 million during 2014 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nOur investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $253.3 million, $328.1 million and $327.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures.\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. and its guarantor subsidiaries filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), pursuant to which Cinemark USA, Inc. offered to exchange the additional 4.875% Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights. The registration statement was declared effective April 18, 2016, and the notes were exchanged on May 17, 2016.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>Standard and Poor's </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cinemark USA, Inc.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n (1) Amounts are presented before adjusting for debt issuance costs. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $130.0 million was recorded for 2015 compared to $97.2 million recorded for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of items related to our Mexican subsidiaries. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\n (1) We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, which results in a more clear presentation of film rentals and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other. \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $2.8 million for 2016 compared to $8.8 million for 2015. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting eight of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.

The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n (2) We have reclassified approximately $26.7 million and $31.0 million of expenses from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, to be consistent with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment (\u201cASU 2011-08\u201d). The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment. The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\nWe primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. In addition, nearly all of our theatres also provide the patron a choice of using a credit card, debit card or advanced-sale type certificates such as a gift card. Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating \u201cfloat\u201d and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $454.1 million, $455.2 million, and $451.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we also performed a test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013. We recently rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations. We estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.\nOther than the operating leases and purchase and other commitments disclosed in the tables above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPrior to December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 5.125% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium. After December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 5.125% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices described in the 5.125% Senior Notes. In addition, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.125% Senior Notes from the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the 5.125% Senior Notes.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n\n \u2022 International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $193.8 million ($228.5 million in constant currency), or 47.2% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $201.3 million, or 47.1 % of admissions revenues, for 2015. Concession supplies expense was $47.2 million ($54.9 million in constant currency), or 20.9% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $48.9 million, or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2015. The decrease in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to price increases.  Salaries and wages increased to $77.6 million ($93.9 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $74.2 million for 2015. The as reported increase was due to incremental staffing to support the 4.1% increase in attendance, increased wage rates and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Facility lease expense increased to $80.6 million ($91.8 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $80.3 million for the 2015 period. The as reported increase was due to increased percentage rent expense as a result of increased constant currency revenues and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $105.0 million ($123.4 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $104.0 million for 2015. The as reported increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs, increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, increased repairs and maintenance expenses and increased janitorial services, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\n7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), (\u201cASU 2016-07\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-07 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The following subsequent Accounting Standards Updates either clarified or revised guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09:\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes and the amendments, in June and December of 2016, to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to an amendment to our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nCovenant Compliance\n (1) All costs are expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except film rentals and advertising, which are expressed as a percentage of admissions revenues and concession supplies, which are expressed as a percentage of concession revenues. \nOn May 8, 2015, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of the $700.0 million term loan from December 2019 to May 2022. Subsequent to the amendment, quarterly principal payments in the amount of $1.8 million were due on the term loan through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $6.9 million in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe amendments in these accounting standards updates may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the amendments within these accounting standards updates in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates on our consolidated financial statements, specifically with respect to our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM, loyalty program accounting, breakage income for stored value cards as well as other ancillary and contractual revenues.\n \u2022 U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $744.3 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2015 compared to $661.5 million, or 54.2% of admissions revenues, for 2014. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films leading to stronger box office performance during the 2015 period. The 2015 period included such blockbuster releases as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Furious 7, American Sniper, Inside Out and Minions, which grossed in excess of $900 million, $650 million, $450 million, $350 million, $350 million, $350 million and $325 million, respectively. Concession supplies expense was $95.4 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for 2015 compared to $86.4 million, or 13.6% of concession revenues, for 2014. \nThe dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.'s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,390.4 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the agreement.\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company's theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company's sale of certain of its shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nCinemark USA, Inc. has a senior secured credit facility that includes a seven year $700.0 million term loan and a five year $100.0 million revolving credit line (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d).\n \u2022 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net), (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent considerations. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for fee owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016. The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily include utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes, at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015. Proceeds, after payment of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc.'s previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021 (the \u201c7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as Cinemark USA, Inc.'s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. The aggregate principal amount of $755.0 million of 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.7 million in connection with the issuance of the additional notes, which, along with the discount of $2.3 million, are reflected as a reduction of long term debt, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 (in millions):\nOn May 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $530.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, at par value, (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $32.0 million during 2016 and $28.1 million during 2015. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $20.4 million during 2016 compared to $8.1 million during 2015. The loss recorded during the 2016 period was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 4) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $28.1 million during 2015 and $22.7 million during 2014. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \nSalaries and wages increased to $226.9 million for 2015 from $202.8 million for 2014 primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $239.4 million for 2015 from $235.2 million for 2014 primarily due to new theatres and increased percentage rent expense due to increased revenues. Utilities and other costs increased to $251.9 million for 2015 from $236.8 million for 2014 primarily due to new theatres and increases in property taxes, janitorial costs and repairs and maintenance expenses.\nAt December 31, 2016, there was $663.8 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had no borrowings under the revolving credit line during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2016. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.0% per annum.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (\u201cASU 2017-04\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.\n (2) Amounts include scheduled interest payments on fixed rate and variable rate debt agreements. Estimates for the variable rate interest payments were based on interest rates in effect on December 31, 2016. The average interest rates in effect on our fixed rate and variable rate debt are 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. \nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-16 is to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A modified retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-16 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nOur U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres with 4,559 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built six new theatres and 69 screens, acquired four theatres with 52 screens and closed eight theatres with 80 screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open three new theatres and 30 screens in domestic markets during 2017 and open six new theatres with 71 screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 101 domestic screens will be approximately $61 million.\n (a) The amount for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX. \nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $104.9 million was recorded for 2016 compared to $130.0 million recorded for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.9%, which included the impact of the implementation of a foreign holding and financing structure that will allow us to use foreign tax credits that had previously carried a full valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss). We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $16.8 million during 2015 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nSalaries and wages increased to $248.2 million for 2016 from $226.9 million for 2015 primarily due to new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $240.7 million for 2016 from $239.4 million for 2015 primarily due to increased percentage rent expense partially offset by decreased common area maintenance expenses. Utilities and other costs decreased to $250.9 million for 2016 from $251.9 million for 2015 primarily due to a decrease in projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring expenses, partially offset by increased security expense.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\n (3) Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \n5.125% Senior Notes\n \u2022 In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-12 is to address certain narrow aspects of ASC Topic 606 including assessing collectability, presentation of sales and other similar taxes, noncash considerations, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition. \nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $14.7 million during 2016 and $18.1 million during 2015, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $209.1 million for 2016 compared to $189.2 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres as well as remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\n \u2022 BB - An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  New Accounting Pronouncements\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\n \u2022 U.S. Admissions revenues increased $41.0 million due to a 1.7% increase in attendance and a 1.3% increase in average ticket price. The increase in concession revenues of $54.9 million was attributable to the 1.7% increase in attendance and a 6.1% increase in concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2016 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales incidence and price increases. \nCinemark USA, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and the guarantors' personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nThe indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,261.8 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 4.875% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 6.3 to 1.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-04, Liabilities - Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20), (\u201cASU 2016-04\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-04 is to provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage of liabilities associated with prepaid stored-value products be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in ASC Topic 606. ASU 2016-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2016-04 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-04 on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $201.3 million ($248.7 million in constant currency), or 47.1% of admissions revenues, for 2015 compared to $194.9 million, or 46.0% of admissions revenues, for 2014. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films and higher box office performance during 2015. Concession supplies expense was $48.9 million ($60.2 million in constant currency), or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2015 compared to $45.6 million, or 21.7% of concession revenues, for 2014. \nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $8.1 million during 2015 compared to $15.7 million during 2014. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S. The loss recorded during 2014 was primarily due to the retirement of certain theatre equipment that was replaced during the period, lease termination charges recorded for theatre closures and a charge for termination of a vendor contract.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-15\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\n (3) Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2014. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nCapital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had an average of 33 and 89 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues. We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\n \u2022 International. Admissions revenues decreased $17.3 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in attendance. Admissions revenues increased $55.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1% increase in attendance and an 8.7% increase in constant currency average ticket price. Concession revenues decreased $1.8 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by the 4.1% increase in attendance. Concession revenues increased $35.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1% increase in attendance and an 11.5% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to new theatres and the success of the films released during 2016. The increase in constant currency average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation. \n \u2022 BBB - An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for all indefinite-lived tradename assets other than our tradename in Ecuador, for which we performed a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company's historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\n (4) The contractual obligations table excludes the long-term portion of our liability for uncertain tax positions of $8.1 million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):\nCash used for financing activities was $146.3 million, $150.5 million, and $152.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds from the issuance of a $225.0 million add-on to our existing 4.875% Senior Notes as well as associated debt issue costs. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 International. Admissions revenues increased $4.1 million as reported, primarily due to an 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Admissions revenues increased $106.3 million in constant currency due to the 11.7% increase in attendance and a 12.1% increase in constant currency average ticket price. Concession revenues increased $17.5 million as reported, primarily due to the 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Concession revenues increased $68.7 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 11.7% increase in attendance and an 18.9% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2015 and new theatres. The increase in constant currency average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation. \n With respect to the ratings issued by Moody's as noted above, Moody's defines these ratings as follows:\n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.'s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries' and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement.\n \u2022 U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $768.9 million, or 55.8% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $744.3 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2015. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films during the 2016 period. Concession supplies expense was $107.3 million, or 14.0% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $95.4 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for 2015. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the impact of our expanded concession offerings. \nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing, among other films. Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Justice League, Spider Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Thor: Ragnarok, The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman, and The Lego Batman Movie, among other films.\n4.875% Senior Notes\nRevenues. Total revenues increased $66.2 million to $2,918.8 million for 2016 from $2,852.6 million for 2015, representing a 2.3% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.\n (1) Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance. \nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt obligations, scheduled interest payments on long-term debt, future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, scheduled interest payments under capital leases and other obligations for each period indicated are summarized as follows:\nRevenues and Expenses\n \u2022 \u2018Ba1' - Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk. The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt. \nCost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.\n \u2022 In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-10 is to clarify certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. \nWe are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity. The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency's evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency's judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time. A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds. Below are our current credit ratings.\nInterest on the term loan accrues at Cinemark USA, Inc.'s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nSalaries and wages increased to $74.2 million ($91.4 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $71.1 million for 2014. The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations and increased local currency wage rates. Facility lease expense decreased to $80.3 million (increased to $99.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $81.9 for 2014. The as reported decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $104.0 million ($129.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $98.3 million for 2014. The as reported increase was due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses, utility expenses and new theatres.\nOn June 3, 2011, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021, at par value (the \u201cSenior Subordinated Notes\u201d).\n (1) Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance. \n\nCost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015.\n (2) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2014. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nRevenues. Total revenues increased $225.6 million to $2,852.6 million for 2015 from $2,627.0 million for 2014, representing an 8.6% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Specifically, ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-18 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSeasonality\nResults of Operations\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $140.6 million for 2016 from $154.1 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased salaries and incentive compensation expense.\n\nActual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.\nOn May 16, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. made a pre-payment of $13.5 million on its term loan using the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of RealD (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, subsequent to the prepayment, quarterly payments in the amount of $1.4 million are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the pre-payment.\n (2) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nRevenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate. We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations. In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.\nRatings\nPrior to June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 4.875% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes to the date of redemption. After June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 4.875% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture.\n\nThe indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,266.5 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 6.4 to 1.\nIncome Taxes\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs. ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \n \u2022 U.S. The $117.2 million increase in admissions revenues was primarily attributable to a 3.3% increase in attendance and a 6.1% increase in average ticket price. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2015 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases and ticket type mix. The $74.1 million increase in concession revenues was primarily attributable to the 3.3% increase in attendance and an 8.2% increase in concession revenues per patron. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales and price increases. Other revenues increased $10.2 million primarily due to increases in screen advertising revenues. \n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n\n (2) U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. \nThe 4.875% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s or a guarantor's debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.'s Credit Agreement. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 4.875% Senior Notes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $189.2 million for 2015 compared to $175.7 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres and remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\nWe may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. During 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company's tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\nWe participate in the consolidated return of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. However, our provision for income taxes is computed on a stand-alone basis. We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nOperating Activities\nOverview\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\n (2) U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.\n \u2022 In December 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\u201cASU 2016-20\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-20 is to amend certain narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including guidance related to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations and prior-period performance obligations, as well as other amendments to the guidance on loan guarantee fees, contract costs, refund liabilities, advertising costs and the clarification of certain examples. \nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2016, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, (\u201cASU 2017-01\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-01 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 \u2018B2' - Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.  With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor's as noted above, Standard and Poor's defines these ratings as follows:\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $18.1 million during 2015 and $18.5 million during 2014, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. NCM did not distribute any excess cash during the second quarter of 2015 due to expenses incurred as the result of the termination of a proposed merger. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvesting Activities\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to the amendment of our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.\n \u2022 In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, (\u201cASU 2015-14\u201d). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (\u201cASU 2014-09). The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. \nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed its Senior Subordinated Notes at a make-whole premium of approximately 104% plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the additional $225.0 million Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above. As a result of the redemption, the Company wrote-off approximately $2.4 million in unamortized debt issue costs, paid a make-whole premium of $9.4 million and paid other fees of $1.2 million, all of which are reflected in loss on debt amendments and refinancing during the year ended December 31, 2016.", "item_7_text": "On December 18, 2012, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2022, at par value (the \u201c5.125% Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2022.\nThe 5.125% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s or a guarantor's debt. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future subordinated debt. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.'s Credit Agreement. The 5.125% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 5.125% Senior Notes.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues. Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved. Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre's historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached. Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time. We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Prospective, retrospective, or modified retrospective application may be used dependent on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09. We will adopt ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the first interim period of 2017. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share based awards will be recognized as discrete items in the income statement during the period in which they occur. We will continue to estimate forfeitures for our share based awards after adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $108.3 million for 2016 compared to $112.7 million for 2015. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the \u201c7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016, as well as the amendments in June and December of 2016 to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt.\nOur international theatre circuit consisted of 187 theatres with 1,344 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built twelve new theatres and 75 screens and closed one theatre with nine screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open five new theatres and 39 screens in international markets during 2017 and open one theatre and five screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 44 international screens will be approximately $18 million.\n (1) We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, which results in a more clear presentation of film rental and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $19.6 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other. \nOur revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $8.8 million for 2015 compared to $6.6 million for 2014. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2014 consisted primarily of U.S. theatre properties, impacting twelve of our twenty-six reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn June 13, 2016 and December 15, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its Credit Agreement to reduce the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.25% and then an additional 0.50%, respectively. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.5 million in connection with these amendments, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $154.1 million for 2015 from $148.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation expense and share based awards compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\n As of December 31, 2016, we had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit line.\nInterest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $112.7 million for 2015 compared to $113.7 million for 2014. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Loss. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $16.8 million during 2015 and $6.2 million during 2014 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nPursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses. The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment. The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company's investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.\nOur investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $253.3 million, $328.1 million and $327.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures.\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. and its guarantor subsidiaries filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), pursuant to which Cinemark USA, Inc. offered to exchange the additional 4.875% Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights. The registration statement was declared effective April 18, 2016, and the notes were exchanged on May 17, 2016.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\n \u2022 budgeted theatre level cash flows; \n (1) Amounts are presented before adjusting for debt issuance costs. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $130.0 million was recorded for 2015 compared to $97.2 million recorded for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of items related to our Mexican subsidiaries. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\n \u2022 competitive theatres in the marketplace; \nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\n (1) We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, which results in a more clear presentation of film rentals and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other. \n \u2022 amortizing intangible asset carrying values; \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $2.8 million for 2016 compared to $8.8 million for 2015. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting eight of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements; \n (3) Includes estimated capital expenditures associated with the construction of new theatres to which we were committed as of December 31, 2016, obligations under employment agreements and contractual purchase commitments. \n \u2022 theatre property and equipment carrying values; \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the impact of recent ticket price changes; \n (2) We have reclassified approximately $26.7 million and $31.0 million of expenses from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, to be consistent with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment (\u201cASU 2011-08\u201d). The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment. The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\nWe primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. In addition, nearly all of our theatres also provide the patron a choice of using a credit card, debit card or advanced-sale type certificates such as a gift card. Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating \u201cfloat\u201d and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $454.1 million, $455.2 million, and $451.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we also performed a test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013. We recently rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations. We estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.\nOther than the operating leases and purchase and other commitments disclosed in the tables above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nPrior to December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 5.125% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium. After December 15, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 5.125% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices described in the 5.125% Senior Notes. In addition, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.125% Senior Notes from the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the 5.125% Senior Notes.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:\n\n \u2022 International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $193.8 million ($228.5 million in constant currency), or 47.2% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $201.3 million, or 47.1 % of admissions revenues, for 2015. Concession supplies expense was $47.2 million ($54.9 million in constant currency), or 20.9% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $48.9 million, or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2015. The decrease in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to price increases.  Salaries and wages increased to $77.6 million ($93.9 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $74.2 million for 2015. The as reported increase was due to incremental staffing to support the 4.1% increase in attendance, increased wage rates and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Facility lease expense increased to $80.6 million ($91.8 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $80.3 million for the 2015 period. The as reported increase was due to increased percentage rent expense as a result of increased constant currency revenues and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $105.0 million ($123.4 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $104.0 million for 2015. The as reported increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs, increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, increased repairs and maintenance expenses and increased janitorial services, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.\n7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), (\u201cASU 2016-07\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-07 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The following subsequent Accounting Standards Updates either clarified or revised guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09:\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes and the amendments, in June and December of 2016, to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to an amendment to our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nCovenant Compliance\n (1) All costs are expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except film rentals and advertising, which are expressed as a percentage of admissions revenues and concession supplies, which are expressed as a percentage of concession revenues. \nOn May 8, 2015, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of the $700.0 million term loan from December 2019 to May 2022. Subsequent to the amendment, quarterly principal payments in the amount of $1.8 million were due on the term loan through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $6.9 million in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe amendments in these accounting standards updates may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the amendments within these accounting standards updates in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates on our consolidated financial statements, specifically with respect to our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM, loyalty program accounting, breakage income for stored value cards as well as other ancillary and contractual revenues.\n \u2022 U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $744.3 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2015 compared to $661.5 million, or 54.2% of admissions revenues, for 2014. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films leading to stronger box office performance during the 2015 period. The 2015 period included such blockbuster releases as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Furious 7, American Sniper, Inside Out and Minions, which grossed in excess of $900 million, $650 million, $450 million, $350 million, $350 million, $350 million and $325 million, respectively. Concession supplies expense was $95.4 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for 2015 compared to $86.4 million, or 13.6% of concession revenues, for 2014. \nThe dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.'s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,390.4 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the agreement.\nWe have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company's theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company's sale of certain of its shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.\nCinemark USA, Inc. has a senior secured credit facility that includes a seven year $700.0 million term loan and a five year $100.0 million revolving credit line (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d).\n \u2022 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net), (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent considerations. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre's useful life. The remainder of the theatre's useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building's remaining useful life for fee owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016. The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.\nUtilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily include utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.\nAccounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements\nFilm rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement. Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run. Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film. The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs. Estimates are based on the expected success of a film. The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known. If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time. Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes, at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015. Proceeds, after payment of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc.'s previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021 (the \u201c7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as Cinemark USA, Inc.'s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. The aggregate principal amount of $755.0 million of 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.7 million in connection with the issuance of the additional notes, which, along with the discount of $2.3 million, are reflected as a reduction of long term debt, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 (in millions):\nOn May 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $530.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, at par value, (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes\u201d). Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $32.0 million during 2016 and $28.1 million during 2015. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $20.4 million during 2016 compared to $8.1 million during 2015. The loss recorded during the 2016 period was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 4) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.\nEquity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $28.1 million during 2015 and $22.7 million during 2014. See Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.\n \u2022 the age of a recently built theatre; \nSalaries and wages increased to $226.9 million for 2015 from $202.8 million for 2014 primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $239.4 million for 2015 from $235.2 million for 2014 primarily due to new theatres and increased percentage rent expense due to increased revenues. Utilities and other costs increased to $251.9 million for 2015 from $236.8 million for 2014 primarily due to new theatres and increases in property taxes, janitorial costs and repairs and maintenance expenses.\nAt December 31, 2016, there was $663.8 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had no borrowings under the revolving credit line during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2016. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.0% per annum.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (\u201cASU 2017-04\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.\n (2) Amounts include scheduled interest payments on fixed rate and variable rate debt agreements. Estimates for the variable rate interest payments were based on interest rates in effect on December 31, 2016. The average interest rates in effect on our fixed rate and variable rate debt are 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. \nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-16 is to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A modified retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-16 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.\nOur U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres with 4,559 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built six new theatres and 69 screens, acquired four theatres with 52 screens and closed eight theatres with 80 screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open three new theatres and 30 screens in domestic markets during 2017 and open six new theatres with 71 screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 101 domestic screens will be approximately $61 million.\n (a) The amount for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX. \nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $104.9 million was recorded for 2016 compared to $130.0 million recorded for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.9%, which included the impact of the implementation of a foreign holding and financing structure that will allow us to use foreign tax credits that had previously carried a full valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFilm rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss). We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $16.8 million during 2015 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nSalaries and wages increased to $248.2 million for 2016 from $226.9 million for 2015 primarily due to new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $240.7 million for 2016 from $239.4 million for 2015 primarily due to increased percentage rent expense partially offset by decreased common area maintenance expenses. Utilities and other costs decreased to $250.9 million for 2016 from $251.9 million for 2015 primarily due to a decrease in projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring expenses, partially offset by increased security expense.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:\n (3) Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \n5.125% Senior Notes\n \u2022 In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-12 is to address certain narrow aspects of ASC Topic 606 including assessing collectability, presentation of sales and other similar taxes, noncash considerations, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition. \nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $14.7 million during 2016 and $18.1 million during 2015, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $209.1 million for 2016 compared to $189.2 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres as well as remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\n \u2022 BB - An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  New Accounting Pronouncements\nWe generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.\n \u2022 U.S. Admissions revenues increased $41.0 million due to a 1.7% increase in attendance and a 1.3% increase in average ticket price. The increase in concession revenues of $54.9 million was attributable to the 1.7% increase in attendance and a 6.1% increase in concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2016 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales incidence and price increases. \nCinemark USA, Inc.'s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and the guarantors' personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nThe indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,261.8 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 4.875% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 6.3 to 1.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-04, Liabilities - Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20), (\u201cASU 2016-04\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-04 is to provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage of liabilities associated with prepaid stored-value products be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in ASC Topic 606. ASU 2016-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2016-04 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-04 on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $201.3 million ($248.7 million in constant currency), or 47.1% of admissions revenues, for 2015 compared to $194.9 million, or 46.0% of admissions revenues, for 2014. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films and higher box office performance during 2015. Concession supplies expense was $48.9 million ($60.2 million in constant currency), or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2015 compared to $45.6 million, or 21.7% of concession revenues, for 2014. \nLoss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $8.1 million during 2015 compared to $15.7 million during 2014. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S. The loss recorded during 2014 was primarily due to the retirement of certain theatre equipment that was replaced during the period, lease termination charges recorded for theatre closures and a charge for termination of a vendor contract.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-15\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\n (3) Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2014. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nCapital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had an average of 33 and 89 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.\nConcession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues. We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.\n \u2022 International. Admissions revenues decreased $17.3 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in attendance. Admissions revenues increased $55.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1% increase in attendance and an 8.7% increase in constant currency average ticket price. Concession revenues decreased $1.8 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by the 4.1% increase in attendance. Concession revenues increased $35.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1% increase in attendance and an 11.5% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to new theatres and the success of the films released during 2016. The increase in constant currency average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation. \n \u2022 BBB - An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for all indefinite-lived tradename assets other than our tradename in Ecuador, for which we performed a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company's historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.\n (4) The contractual obligations table excludes the long-term portion of our liability for uncertain tax positions of $8.1 million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):\nCash used for financing activities was $146.3 million, $150.5 million, and $152.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds from the issuance of a $225.0 million add-on to our existing 4.875% Senior Notes as well as associated debt issue costs. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 International. Admissions revenues increased $4.1 million as reported, primarily due to an 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Admissions revenues increased $106.3 million in constant currency due to the 11.7% increase in attendance and a 12.1% increase in constant currency average ticket price. Concession revenues increased $17.5 million as reported, primarily due to the 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Concession revenues increased $68.7 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 11.7% increase in attendance and an 18.9% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2015 and new theatres. The increase in constant currency average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation. \n With respect to the ratings issued by Moody's as noted above, Moody's defines these ratings as follows:\n \u2022 available lease renewal options; and \nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.'s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries' and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement.\n \u2022 U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $768.9 million, or 55.8% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $744.3 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2015. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films during the 2016 period. Concession supplies expense was $107.3 million, or 14.0% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $95.4 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for 2015. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the impact of our expanded concession offerings. \nFilms leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing, among other films. Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Justice League, Spider Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Thor: Ragnarok, The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman, and The Lego Batman Movie, among other films.\n4.875% Senior Notes\nRevenues. Total revenues increased $66.2 million to $2,918.8 million for 2016 from $2,852.6 million for 2015, representing a 2.3% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.\n (1) Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance. \nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt obligations, scheduled interest payments on long-term debt, future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, scheduled interest payments under capital leases and other obligations for each period indicated are summarized as follows:\nRevenues and Expenses\n \u2022 \u2018Ba1' - Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk. The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt. \nCost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.\n \u2022 In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-10 is to clarify certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. \nWe are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity. The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency's evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency's judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time. A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds. Below are our current credit ratings.\nInterest on the term loan accrues at Cinemark USA, Inc.'s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US \u201cPrime Rate\u201d as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nSalaries and wages increased to $74.2 million ($91.4 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $71.1 million for 2014. The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations and increased local currency wage rates. Facility lease expense decreased to $80.3 million (increased to $99.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $81.9 for 2014. The as reported decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $104.0 million ($129.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $98.3 million for 2014. The as reported increase was due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses, utility expenses and new theatres.\nOn June 3, 2011, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021, at par value (the \u201cSenior Subordinated Notes\u201d).\n (1) Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance. \n\nCost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015.\n (2) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2014. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nRevenues. Total revenues increased $225.6 million to $2,852.6 million for 2015 from $2,627.0 million for 2014, representing an 8.6% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Specifically, ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-18 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSeasonality\nResults of Operations\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $140.6 million for 2016 from $154.1 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased salaries and incentive compensation expense.\n\nActual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.\nOn May 16, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. made a pre-payment of $13.5 million on its term loan using the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of RealD (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, subsequent to the prepayment, quarterly payments in the amount of $1.4 million are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the pre-payment.\n (2) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \nRevenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office. Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising. Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre. We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate. We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations. In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.\nRatings\nPrior to June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 4.875% Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes to the date of redemption. After June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 4.875% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture.\n\nThe indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,266.5 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 5.125% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 6.4 to 1.\nIncome Taxes\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs. ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. \n \u2022 U.S. The $117.2 million increase in admissions revenues was primarily attributable to a 3.3% increase in attendance and a 6.1% increase in average ticket price. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2015 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases and ticket type mix. The $74.1 million increase in concession revenues was primarily attributable to the 3.3% increase in attendance and an 8.2% increase in concession revenues per patron. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales and price increases. Other revenues increased $10.2 million primarily due to increases in screen advertising revenues. \n \u2022 actual theatre level cash flows; \n\n (2) U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. \nThe 4.875% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s or a guarantor's debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s and its guarantor's existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.'s Credit Agreement. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.'s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 4.875% Senior Notes.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $189.2 million for 2015 compared to $175.7 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres and remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.\nWe may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.\nTradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. During 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management's estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company's tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.\nWe participate in the consolidated return of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. However, our provision for income taxes is computed on a stand-alone basis. We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.\nOperating Activities\nOverview\nTheatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.\n (2) U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.\nFacility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.\n \u2022 In December 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\u201cASU 2016-20\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2016-20 is to amend certain narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including guidance related to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations and prior-period performance obligations, as well as other amendments to the guidance on loan guarantee fees, contract costs, refund liabilities, advertising costs and the clarification of certain examples. \nWe are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of December 31, 2016, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments - U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, (\u201cASU 2017-01\u201d). The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-01 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 \u2018B2' - Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.  With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor's as noted above, Standard and Poor's defines these ratings as follows:\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.\nDistributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $18.1 million during 2015 and $18.5 million during 2014, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. NCM did not distribute any excess cash during the second quarter of 2015 due to expenses incurred as the result of the termination of a proposed merger. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvesting Activities\nLoss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to the amendment of our senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.\n \u2022 In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, (\u201cASU 2015-14\u201d). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (\u201cASU 2014-09). The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. \nOn March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed its Senior Subordinated Notes at a make-whole premium of approximately 104% plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the additional $225.0 million Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above. As a result of the redemption, the Company wrote-off approximately $2.4 million in unamortized debt issue costs, paid a make-whole premium of $9.4 million and paid other fees of $1.2 million, all of which are reflected in loss on debt amendments and refinancing during the year ended December 31, 2016.", "item_7_tables": "Table 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
