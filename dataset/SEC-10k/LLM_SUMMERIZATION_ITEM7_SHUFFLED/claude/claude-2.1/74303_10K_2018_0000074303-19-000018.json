MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it, and therefore, our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment's business that is strictly commodity.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. We have little or no ability to influence prices in the large, global commodity markets. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Cyclical price swings, driven by changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are predominately commodity markets. We have little or no ability to influence prices in these large, global commodity markets. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\n2018 Overview\nNet income was $327.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $549.5 million for 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects a tax benefit of $437.9 million from the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). After adjusting for the provisional benefit of the 2017 Tax Act, the increase in results from the prior year was due to improved Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results, primarily due to higher product prices. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Winchester segment results and increased costs associated with the Information Technology Project. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate and an $8.0 million pretax gain from an insurance recovery resulting from a second quarter 2017 Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility business interruption claim.\nIn 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million compared to $405.8 million for 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher than in the prior year due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was negatively impacted by lower caustic soda volumes, a less favorable product mix and higher costs, including raw material and freight costs, maintenance to improve reliability and depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by the $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls recorded a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to an adjustment to the value of our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas Storage Company, Ltd. (Bay Gas). Bay Gas owns, leases and operates underground gas storage and related pipeline facilities which are used to provide\nstorage in the McIntosh, AL area and delivery of natural gas. The general partner, Sempra Energy (Sempra), announced in the second quarter of 2018 its plan to sell several assets including its 90.9% interest in Bay Gas. In connection with this decision, Sempra recorded an impairment charge related to Bay Gas adjusting the related assets' carrying values to an estimated fair value. We recorded a reduction in our investment in the non-consolidated affiliate for the proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge. Olin has no other non-consolidated affiliates. On January 1, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for approximately $20 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of approximately $11 million which will be included in first quarter 2019 results.\nDuring 2017, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased $140 per ton and the caustic soda export price indices increased approximately $260 per metric ton creating positive pricing momentum entering 2018. During 2018, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased an additional $40 per ton while the caustic soda export price indices decreased $270 per metric ton. However, during the second half of 2018 both domestic and export price indices experienced declines.\nIn 2018, Epoxy generated segment income of $52.8 million compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017. Epoxy segment results were higher than the prior year primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy segment results for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by $23.1 million of additional maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds, which were primarily associated with an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX. Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.7 million. Epoxy segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017. Winchester segment income declined from the prior year primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs and decreased demand for commercial ammunition resulting in lower commercial sales volumes and lower product pricing. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $111.0 million to the environmental provision, which was net of estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. We incurred legal fees of $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 associated with these recovery actions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we made long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, of $376.1 million. On January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminated the required quarterly installments under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,946.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,550.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>5,822.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,554.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,944.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>1,124.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>713.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administration\n</td> <td>430.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>676.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(19.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>243.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating pension income\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>437.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.02\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.02\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nSales for 2018 were $6,946.1 million compared to $6,268.4 million in 2017, an increase of $677.7 million, or 11%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $485.9 million primarily due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives, partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy sales increased by $216.7 million primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Winchester sales decreased by $24.9 million primarily due to lower sales to commercial customers, partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nGross margin increased $410.5 million, or 58%, from 2017. Gross margin was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $263.8 million, primarily due to higher product pricing partially offset by increased costs, lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy gross margin increased $78.3 million primarily due to higher product prices partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy gross margin was also negatively impacted by the cost of an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX, which also reduced volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy 2017 gross margins were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $34.0 million primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs, lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix and lower selling prices. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 16% in 2018 from 11% in 2017.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2018 increased $60.8 million, or 16%, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $15.6 million, primarily associated with environmental recovery actions, increased incentive compensation expense of $11.6 million, an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.9 million and higher consulting and contract services of $10.4 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont. These increased costs were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2018 and 2017.\nRestructuring charges in 2018 and 2017 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges in 2018 were also associated with a December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility.\nEarnings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates decreased by $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during 2018.\nInterest expense increased by $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates and an increase of $12.1 million of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount, partially offset by a lower level of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses and higher Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nSales for 2017 were $6,268.4 million compared to $5,550.6 million in 2016, an increase of $717.8 million, or 13%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $501.5 million primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Epoxy sales increased by $264.4 million primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Winchester sales decreased by $48.1 million primarily due to decreased shipments to commercial customers, partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nGross margin in 2017 increased $107.4 million, or 18%, from 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $183.6 million, primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were higher electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices, compared to 2016. Epoxy gross margin decreased $26.6 million primarily due to increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy gross margins were also negatively impacted by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages and Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $52.9 million primarily due to lower commercial volumes, a less favorable product mix and increased commodity and other material costs. Gross margin as a percentage of sales were 11% in both 2017 and 2016.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2017 increased $22.6 million, or 7%, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and contract services of $10.5 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont, and higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses for 2017 also included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2017 and 2016.\nRestructuring charges in 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $76.6 million of these charges were non-cash asset impairment charges for equipment and facilities. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were also associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014 and the relocation of our Winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from East Alton, IL to Oxford, MS which was completed during 2016.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11.0 million insurance recovery for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nInterest expense increased by $25.5 million in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher interest rates, $3.9 million of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount and the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $2.7 million associated with the redemption of the Sumitomo Credit Facility and a portion of the $1,850.0 million senior credit facility.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2016 included benefits associated with return to provision adjustments, primarily related to salt depletion and non-deductible acquisition costs, and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a change in prior year uncertain tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $3.9 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2016 of 77.2% was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions in combination with a pretax loss.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester.

The sales increase was primarily due to increased caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives pricing. The higher product prices were partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million for 2018 compared to $405.8 million for 2017, an increase of $231.3 million, or 57%. The increase in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was primarily due to higher product prices ($502.9 million) and lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017, partially offset by higher ethane prices ($8.0 million). Partially offsetting these benefits were higher raw material and freight costs ($147.5 million), lower volumes, primarily caustic soda, and a less favorable product mix ($71.1 million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($40.9 million) and increased operating costs ($25.6 million), primarily maintenance to improve reliability. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2017 were $3,500.8 million compared to $2,999.3 million for 2016, an increase of $501.5 million, or 17%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $405.8 million for 2017 compared to $224.9 million for 2016, an increase of $180.9 million, or 80%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher due to higher product prices ($385.5 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($8.7 million). The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. These increases were partially offset by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($102.5 million) and incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices ($51.6 million), and operating costs ($32.2 million) were also higher compared to 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $432.2 million and $418.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEpoxy\n2018 Compared to 2017\nEpoxy sales were $2,303.1 million for 2018 compared to $2,086.4 million for 2017, an increase of $216.7 million, or 10%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) and a favorable effect of foreign currency translation ($48.2 million), partially offset by lower volumes ($153.9 million). Epoxy 2018 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with planned maintenance turnarounds, while 2017 Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $52.8 million for 2018 compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017, an increase of $64.6 million. The increase in Epoxy segment results was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) partially offset by higher raw material costs ($190.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy results were also negatively impacted by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($42.2 million), higher maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with turnarounds and outages ($23.1 million), increased operating costs, including utilities ($21.3 million) and higher depreciation and amortization expense ($8.1 million). Additionally, Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nEpoxy sales were $2,086.4 million for 2017 compared to $1,822.0 million for 2016, an increase of $264.4 million, or 15%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($52.7 million). Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nEpoxy reported a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017 compared to segment income of $15.4 million for 2016, a decrease of $27.2 million. Epoxy segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million) and higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($15.3 million). Epoxy segment results were also impacted by increased raw material costs ($227.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene, and higher operating costs ($1.7 million). These decreases impacting segment results were partially offset by higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($33.6 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $94.3 million and $90.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWinchester\n2018 Compared to 2017\nWinchester sales were $656.3 million for 2018 compared to $681.2 million for 2017, a decrease of $24.9 million, or 4%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($43.4 million), partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($18.5 million).\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $34.0 million, or 47%. The decrease in segment income was due to higher commodity and other material costs ($19.6 million), lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix ($9.4 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by lower operating costs ($3.0 million), including depreciation and amortization expense. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nWinchester sales were $681.2 million for 2017 compared to $729.3 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.1 million, or 7%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($89.4 million), partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($41.3 million). The decrease in commercial sales primarily reflects lower demand in shotshell, pistol and rifle ammunition.\nWinchester reported segment income of $72.4 million for 2017 compared to $120.9 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.5 million, or 40%. The decrease in segment income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($35.0 million), increased commodity and other material costs ($10.6 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of lower operating costs ($5.1 million). Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $19.5 million and $18.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCorporate/Other\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCredits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million for 2018, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities would have been $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nFor 2018, other corporate and unallocated costs were $158.3 million compared to $112.4 million for 2017, an increase of $45.9 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $18.0 million and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.6 million. The increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. The higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses were primarily due to legal fees associated with environmental recovery actions.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCharges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $8.5 million for 2017 compared to $9.2 million for 2016. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nFor 2017, other corporate and unallocated costs were $112.4 million compared to $91.4 million for 2016, an increase of $21.0 million, or 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments, increased consulting charges of $7.3 million and costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million.\nRestructurings\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia. Subsequent to the facility's closure, product for customers in the region will be sourced from Winchester manufacturing facilities located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $4.1 million for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, employee severance and related benefit costs and lease and other contract termination costs related to this action. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $1 million related to this closure.\nOn March 21, 2016, we announced that we had made the decision to close a combined total of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Associated with this action, we have permanently closed our Henderson, NV chlor alkali plant with 153,000 tons of capacity and have reconfigured the site to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda and hydrochloric acid. Also, the capacity of our Niagara Falls, NY chlor alkali plant has been reduced from 300,000 tons to 240,000 tons and the chlor alkali capacity at our Freeport, TX facility was reduced by 220,000 tons. This 220,000 ton reduction was entirely from diaphragm cell capacity. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $15.7 million, $32.6 million and $111.3 million, respectively, for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, lease and other contract termination costs, employee severance and related benefit costs, employee relocation costs and facility exit costs related to these actions. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $10 million related to these capacity reductions.\n2019 OUTLOOK\nNet income in 2019 is projected to be approximately $1.60 per diluted share, which includes estimated pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs totaling approximately $80 million. Net income in 2018 was $1.95 per diluted share, which includes pretax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million, pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs of $58.4 million and a pretax non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate of $21.5 million.\nWe currently expect the first quarter of 2019 to have the lowest quarterly earnings per diluted share in 2019. We expect the first quarter of 2019 earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels but higher than first quarter 2018 levels. The year over year increase reflects improved pricing for chlorine, ethylene dichloride and chlorine derivatives and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs in the Epoxy business partially offset by the lower year over year caustic soda prices.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2019 segment income is expected to be comparable to 2018 segment income of $637.1 million reflecting improved chlorine, EDC and chlorine-derivatives pricing, which are expected to be offset by lower caustic soda pricing, higher freight and logistics costs, and higher ethylene costs, due to increased ethane pricing.\nEpoxy 2019 segment results are expected to improve from the 2018 segment income of $52.8 million as increased volumes, lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs are expected to more than offset lower product pricing.\nWinchester 2019 segment income is expected to be similar to the 2018 segment income of $38.4 million primarily due to expected lower commodity and other material costs and lower operating costs offset by declines in commercial demand. Military and other government sales are expected to be consistent with 2018.\nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2019 are expected to be higher than 2018 Other Corporate and Unallocated costs of $158.3 million due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project and higher stock based compensation costs partially offset by lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses. Costs associated with the Information Technology Project are estimated to increase approximately $30 million in 2019 compared to 2018, which reflects duplicative costs incurred to maintain legacy systems while transitioning to new systems.\nDuring 2019, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $7.3 million, excluding the $111.0 million of insurance recoveries, in 2018. We do not believe that there will be additional recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods during 2019.\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2019 to be in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $21.7 million in 2018. We expect higher amortization of deferred pension actuarial losses. Based on our plan assumptions and\nestimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2019.\nIn 2019, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, including the investment associated with the Information Technology Project of approximately $80 million. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $590 million to $610 million range.\nWe currently believe that both the 2019 effective tax rate and the cash tax rate will be approximately 25%.\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nUnder ASC 715, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2017, we recorded an after-tax charge of $21.6 million ($27.3 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2017 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 50-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2017. In 2016, we recorded an after-tax charge of $37.5 million ($61.0 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2016 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 30-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2016. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility.\nDuring 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $6.0 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2019.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.\nAt December 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation of $2,661.9 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $668.9 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nComponents of net periodic benefit (income) costs were:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefit costs\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash outlays:\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remedial and investigatory spending (charged to reserve)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant operations (charged to cost of goods sold)\n</td> <td>197.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash outlays\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior\nyears. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2019 are estimated to be approximately $220 million, of which approximately $17 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $200 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2019 than 2018 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charges to income\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remedial and investigatory spending\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation adjustments\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites, have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry. In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs. We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites.\nIn connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities relating to releases of hazardous materials and violations of environmental law to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $8.6 million at December 31, 2018. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nEnvironmental provisions (credited) charged to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provisions charged to income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries for costs incurred and expensed\n</td> <td>(111.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental (income) expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites.\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nOur total estimated environmental liability at the end of 2018 was attributable to 60 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 79% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 51 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At three of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. At two of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and at another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. The two remaining sites are in long-term OM&M. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 22% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $125.6 million at December 31, 2018, and $131.6 million at December 31, 2017, of which $108.6 million and $111.6 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $125.6 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $68.9 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $14.1 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $42.6 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2018, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe are party to a dispute relating to a contract at our Plaquemine, LA facility. The other party to the contract has filed a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that Olin breached the related agreement and claiming damages in excess of the amount Olin believes it is obligated to pay under the contract. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for the fourth quarter 2019. Any additional losses related to this contract dispute are not currently estimable because of unresolved questions of fact and law but, if resolved unfavorably to Olin, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe, and our subsidiaries, are defendants in various other legal actions (including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos) incidental to our past and current business activities. We describe some of these matters in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of $15.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively. These liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation and do not include $8.0 million of insurance recoveries included in receivables, net within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. Based on our analysis, and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially and adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities related to litigation to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency. In certain instances such as environmental projects, we are responsible for managing the clean-up and remediation of an environmental site. There exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties. We account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies\u201d and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an insurance recovery of $8.0 million in other operating income for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized an insurance recovery of $11.0 million in other operating income for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\nCash Flow Data\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used for)\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>603.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(385.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(294.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business acquired and related transactions, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments under long-term supply contracts\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(209.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(175.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale/leaseback of equipment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investing activities\n</td> <td>(382.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(498.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(473.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt repayments, net\n</td> <td>(376.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(205.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock repurchased and retired\n</td> <td>(50.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock options exercised\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net financing activities\n</td> <td>(564.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(337.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\nFor 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased by $45.6 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in our operating results. For 2017, working capital decreased $9.8 million compared to a decrease of $80.9 million in 2016. Receivables increased from December 31, 2016 by $49.9 million primarily as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2017, inventories increased by $37.8 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $100.0 million. The increase in inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to an increase in raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2017, a payment of $209.4 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. In 2016, payments of $175.7 million were made related to arrangements for the long-term supply of low cost electricity.\nIn 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to the Acquisition for certain acquisition-related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nIn 2016, we entered into sale/leaseback transactions for railcars that we acquired in connection with the Acquisition. We received proceeds from the sales of $40.4 million.\nIn 2016, we received $8.8 million from the October 2013 sale of a bleach joint venture.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $376.1 million, which included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nIn 2018, we repurchased and retired 2.1 million shares with a total value of $50.0 million under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on April 26, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $2.4 million, which included $51.6 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility and the remaining $12.2 million due under the $97.5 million Series O and $97.5 million Series G SunBelt notes (SunBelt Notes).\nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into a new five-year, $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Credit Facility), which replaced our previous $500.0 million senior revolving credit facility, and a $1,375.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). We recognized interest expense of $1.2 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action during 2017. The proceeds of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility were used to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo credit facility (Sumitomo Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility will mature in March 2022.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027 (2027 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (Receivables Financing Agreement). Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nDuring 2016, we repaid $67.5 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,350.0 million term loan facility. We also repaid $210.0 million under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement during 2016. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. We recognized interest expense of $1.5 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action in 2017.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, we repaid $12.2 million due under the annual requirements of the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes have been repaid.\nIn June 2016, we also repaid $125.0 million of 6.75% senior notes (2016 Notes), which became due.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued 0.2 million, 1.7 million and 0.3 million shares, respectively, with a total value of $3.4 million, $32.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively, representing stock options exercised.\nIn 2018, we paid debt issuance costs of $8.5 million relating to the 2030 Notes. In 2017, we paid debt issuance costs of $11.2 million relating to the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. In 2016, we paid debt issuance costs of $1.0 million for the registration of the $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due October 15, 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due October 15, 2025 under the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 53.3% at December 31, 2018 compared to 56.7% at December 31, 2017, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results, partially offset by the payment of dividends, and a lower level of debt outstanding. The percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 56.7% at December 31, 2017 compared to 61.4% at December 31, 2016, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results partially offset by the payment of dividends.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $133.6 million, $133.0 million and $132.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On January 25, 2019, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 11, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2019.\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, accounts receivable factoring arrangement and Receivables Financing Agreement. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\nThe overall cash decrease of $39.6 million in 2018 primarily reflects our capital spending and long-term debt repayments, net, partially offset by our operating results. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, $450.0 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminates the required quarterly installments under the Term Loan Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, long-term debt repayments included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into the $1,975.0 million Senior Credit Facility, which amended and restated the existing $1,850.0 million senior credit facility. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility was increased to $1,375.0 million, and the aggregate commitments under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility were increased from $500.0 million to $600.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit. In March 2017, we drew the entire $1,375.0 million term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility of $1,282.5 million and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo Credit Facility. The maturity date for the Senior Credit Facility was extended from October 5, 2020 to March 9, 2022. The $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. The Term Loan Facility included amortization payable in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. However, in connection with the $550.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan Facility in January 2018, the required quarterly installments of the Term Loan Facility were eliminated. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we repaid $51.6 million and $67.5 million, respectively, under the required quarterly installments of the term loan facilities.\nUnder the Senior Credit Facility, we may select various floating rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As of December 31, 2018, there were no covenants or other restrictions that would have limited our ability to borrow under these facilities.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and DowDuPont entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by DowDuPont to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments of $433.5 million on the Closing Date in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics. During 2017, we made an additional payment of $209.4 million in connection with our option to reserve additional ethylene supply at producer economics from DowDuPont. On February 27, 2017, we also exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from DowDuPont. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, an additional payment will be made to DowDuPont of between $440 million and $465 million on or about the fourth quarter of 2020.\nDuring 2016, Olin entered into arrangements to increase our supply of low cost electricity. These arrangements improve manufacturing flexibility at our Freeport, TX and Plaquemine, LA facilities, reduce our overall electricity cost and accelerate the realization of cost synergies available from the Acquired Business. In conjunction with these arrangements, Olin made payments of $175.7 million during 2016.\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had $125.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $315.0 million. We will continue to service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $1,372.3 million, $1,655.2 million and $533.6 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.3 million, $3.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $132.4 million, $182.3 million and $126.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nWe finalized our purchase price allocation of the Acquisition during the third quarter of 2016. During 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to certain acquisition related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nDuring 2016, $210.0 million was repaid under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes.\nCash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results, which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve, such as the vinyls, urethanes, bleach, ammunition and pulp and paper. Cash flow from operations is affected by changes in chlorine, caustic soda and EDC selling prices caused by the changes in the supply/demand balance of these products, resulting in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment having significant leverage on our earnings and cash flow. For example, assuming all other costs remain constant, internal consumption remains approximately the same and we are operating at full capacity, a $10 selling price change per ton of chlorine equates to an approximate $10 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, a $10 selling price change per ton of caustic soda equates to an approximate $30 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, and a $0.01 selling price change per pound of EDC equates to an approximate $20 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit.\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, $12.2 million was repaid on the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes had been repaid.\nIn June 2016, we repaid $125.0 million of the 2016 Notes, which became due.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total letters of credit of $74.7 million outstanding, of which $3.5 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and capital lease obligations, of $3,230.3 million, of which $823.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are $125.9 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2020, $0.5 million in 2021, $743.4 million in 2022, $720.3 million in 2023 and a total of $1,706.2 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,230.3 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 were deferred debt issuance costs and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $67.8 million.\nIn April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million, and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), PNC Bank, National Association and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nIn April 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are Toronto-Dominion Bank and SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., both of which are major financial institutions.\nIn October 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on an additional $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are PNC Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo, both of which are major financial institutions.\nWe have designated the April 2016 and October 2016 interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings. Accordingly,\nthe swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of $33.7 million and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in the carrying amount of the related debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOur operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions.\nOur long-term contractual commitments, including the on and off-balance sheet arrangements, consisted of the following:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion above under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d).\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 14 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 18 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 15 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $74.7 million of which $3.5 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger the two-step impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. Based upon our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2018. No impairment charges were recorded for 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\nThe discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the cyclical nature of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable.\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Our discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nEnvironmental\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update includes adding, clarifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with earlier application permitted. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d which amends ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements.\u201d This update includes adding, modifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied on a prospective basis for certain changes and retrospectively for other changes. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118\u201d (SAB 118) which amends ASC 740 Income Taxes.\u201d This update codifies the guidance in SAB 118. SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During 2017, we recognized a provisional deferred tax benefit of $437.9 million, which was included as a\ncomponent of income tax (benefit) provision. At December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. During 2018, we increased the deferred tax benefit by $3.9 million as a result of filing the 2017 U.S. and foreign tax returns and decreased the deferred tax benefit by $0.1 million as a result of additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service.\nIn February 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d which amends ASC 220 Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income.\u201d This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act during each fiscal year or quarter in which the effect of the lower tax rate is recorded. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update in March 2018 and reclassified $85.9 million related to the deferred gain resulting from the 2017 Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities\u201d which amends ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d (ASC 815). This update is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedge programs. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update requires the presentation of the service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The update requires the presentation of the other components of the net periodic benefit (income) costs separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a change in our net periodic benefit (income) costs within operating income, which was offset by a corresponding change in non-operating pension income to reflect the impact of presenting the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service cost and net actuarial loss components of net periodic benefit (income) costs outside of operating income. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a reclassification of $15.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively, from cost of goods sold, and $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively, from selling and administration expenses to non-operating pension income reflecting the aforementioned reclassification on our consolidated statements of operations. The service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs continues to be included in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d which amends ASC 350. This update will simplify the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This update will require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The update does not modify the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a prospective basis with earlier application permitted. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2020 and do not expect the update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d which amends ASC 230 Statement of Cash Flows.\u201d This update will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The update will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. In connection with this update, we made an accounting policy election to apply the nature of the distribution approach when determining the proper classification of distributions received from equity method investments. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases,\u201d (ASU 2016-02) which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-02, ASC 842 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented. An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption. These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. Adoption of these updates resulted in the recording of additional operating lease assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of between approximately $275 million and $325 million as of January 1, 2019. Our assets and liabilities for finance leases remained unchanged. We also recognized the cumulative effect of applying these updates as an adjustment to retained earnings of between approximately $10 million and $15 million, net of the deferred tax impact, primarily related to the recognition of previously deferred sale/leaseback gains. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this adoption. These updates also impacted our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures related to leases.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASU 2014-09), which amends ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASC 606). Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, ASC 606 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates provide guidance on how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this update recognized at the date of initial application. These updates also expand the disclosure requirements surrounding revenue recorded from contracts with customers. These updates are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The cumulative effect of applying the updates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The most significant impact the updates had was on our accounting policies and disclosures on revenue recognition. Expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition are included within our notes to consolidated financial statements.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized into earnings. Gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings.\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on derivative contracts resulted in gains of $5.4 million and $1.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and losses of $5.8 million in 2016 which were included in cost\nof goods sold. At December 31, 2018, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2022 totaling $116.5 million (2017-$92.8 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax loss of $2.6 million.\nIf commodity prices were to remain at December 31, 2018 levels, approximately $2.3 million of deferred losses, net of tax, would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur.\nWe use interest rate swaps as a means of minimizing cash flow fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates of our variable-rate borrowings. In April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. If all open interest rate swap contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $5.3 million.\nIf interest rates were to remain at December 31, 2018 levels, $5.3 million of deferred gains would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual interest rates when the forecasted transactions occur.\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were $500.0 million.\nWe have designated these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of $33.7 million and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in the carrying amount of the related debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $123.7 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $82.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $135.5 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $97.7 million.\nOur foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. The effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a (loss) gain of $(5.4) million, $1.8 million and $(11.5) million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative asset\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative liability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Epoxy 2019 segment results are expected to improve from the 2018 segment income of $52.8 million as increased volumes, lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs are expected to more than offset lower product pricing.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charges to income\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remedial and investigatory spending\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation adjustments\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $6.0 million.

The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nAt December 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation of $2,661.9 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $668.9 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nWe have designated these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed-rate borrowings.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales:\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,986.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,500.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,999.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Epoxy\n</td> <td>2,303.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,086.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,822.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Winchester\n</td> <td>656.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>729.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,946.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,550.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Epoxy\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Winchester\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate/Other:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental income (expense)(2)\n</td> <td>103.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate and unallocated costs(3)\n</td> <td>(158.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges(4)\n</td> <td>(21.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs(5)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income(6)\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense(7)\n</td> <td>(243.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(191.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating pension income(8)\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRestructuring charges in 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $76.6 million of these charges were non-cash asset impairment charges for equipment and facilities. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were also associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014 and the relocation of our Winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from East Alton, IL to Oxford, MS which was completed during 2016.\n (4) These amounts are only estimated payments assuming for our foreign qualified pension plans a weighted average annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 5.2% and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 2.2%. These estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated. In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. \nOur total estimated environmental liability at the end of 2018 was attributable to 60 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 79% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 51 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At three of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. At two of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and at another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. The two remaining sites are in long-term OM&M. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 22% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations, including capital lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,298.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,463.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,706.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements(2)\n</td> <td>1,421.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent tax liability\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic qualified pension plan contributions(3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International qualified pension plan contributions(4)\n</td> <td>232.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualified pension plan payments\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement benefit payments\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term supply contracts\n</td> <td>441.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>441.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-Balance Sheet Commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>345.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchasing commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raw materials\n</td> <td>7,920.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,369.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,424.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilities\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,749.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,109.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,377.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,885.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency.

In April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. If all open interest rate swap contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $5.3 million.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative asset\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative liability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $125.6 million at December 31, 2018, and $131.6 million at December 31, 2017, of which $108.6 million and $111.6 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $125.6 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $68.9 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $14.1 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $42.6 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provisions charged to income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries for costs incurred and expensed\n</td> <td>(111.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental (income) expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2019 are estimated to be approximately $220 million, of which approximately $17 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $200 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2019 than 2018 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefit costs\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

Operating segment results for 2017 and 2016 have been restated to reflect this accounting change. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d which amends ASC 350. This update will simplify the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This update will require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The update does not modify the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a prospective basis with earlier application permitted. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2020 and do not expect the update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million.\nThe fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were:\nCharges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $8.5 million for 2017 compared to $9.2 million for 2016. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses and higher Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nIn 2016, we entered into sale/leaseback transactions for railcars that we acquired in connection with the Acquisition. We received proceeds from the sales of $40.4 million.\nNet income was $327.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $549.5 million for 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects a tax benefit of $437.9 million from the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). After adjusting for the provisional benefit of the 2017 Tax Act, the increase in results from the prior year was due to improved Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results, primarily due to higher product prices. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Winchester segment results and increased costs associated with the Information Technology Project. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate and an $8.0 million pretax gain from an insurance recovery resulting from a second quarter 2017 Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility business interruption claim.\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it, and therefore, our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment's business that is strictly commodity.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2017, a payment of $209.4 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. In 2016, payments of $175.7 million were made related to arrangements for the long-term supply of low cost electricity.\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $315.0 million. We will continue to service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $1,372.3 million, $1,655.2 million and $533.6 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.3 million, $3.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $132.4 million, $182.3 million and $126.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $405.8 million for 2017 compared to $224.9 million for 2016, an increase of $180.9 million, or 80%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher due to higher product prices ($385.5 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($8.7 million). The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. These increases were partially offset by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($102.5 million) and incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices ($51.6 million), and operating costs ($32.2 million) were also higher compared to 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $432.2 million and $418.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an insurance recovery of $8.0 million in other operating income for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized an insurance recovery of $11.0 million in other operating income for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEpoxy reported a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017 compared to segment income of $15.4 million for 2016, a decrease of $27.2 million. Epoxy segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million) and higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($15.3 million). Epoxy segment results were also impacted by increased raw material costs ($227.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene, and higher operating costs ($1.7 million). These decreases impacting segment results were partially offset by higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($33.6 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $94.3 million and $90.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nSales for 2018 were $6,946.1 million compared to $6,268.4 million in 2017, an increase of $677.7 million, or 11%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $485.9 million primarily due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives, partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy sales increased by $216.7 million primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Winchester sales decreased by $24.9 million primarily due to lower sales to commercial customers, partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.\n2018 Overview\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Our discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nUnder ASC 715, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2017, we recorded an after-tax charge of $21.6 million ($27.3 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2017 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 50-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2017. In 2016, we recorded an after-tax charge of $37.5 million ($61.0 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2016 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 30-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2016. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027 (2027 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nGoodwill\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118\u201d (SAB 118) which amends ASC 740 Income Taxes.\u201d This update codifies the guidance in SAB 118. SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During 2017, we recognized a provisional deferred tax benefit of $437.9 million, which was included as a\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we made long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, of $376.1 million. On January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminated the required quarterly installments under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, $12.2 million was repaid on the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes had been repaid.\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were $500.0 million.\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nDuring 2016, we repaid $67.5 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,350.0 million term loan facility. We also repaid $210.0 million under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement during 2016. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. We recognized interest expense of $1.5 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action in 2017.\nCorporate/Other\n (3) Other corporate and unallocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. \nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2018, we paid debt issuance costs of $8.5 million relating to the 2030 Notes. In 2017, we paid debt issuance costs of $11.2 million relating to the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. In 2016, we paid debt issuance costs of $1.0 million for the registration of the $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due October 15, 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due October 15, 2025 under the Securities Act of 1933.\nIn connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities relating to releases of hazardous materials and violations of environmental law to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $376.1 million, which included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update includes adding, clarifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with earlier application permitted. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental provisions (credited) charged to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\nInvesting Activities\n\n\nIn February 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d which amends ASC 220 Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income.\u201d This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act during each fiscal year or quarter in which the effect of the lower tax rate is recorded. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update in March 2018 and reclassified $85.9 million related to the deferred gain resulting from the 2017 Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.\n\nstorage in the McIntosh, AL area and delivery of natural gas. The general partner, Sempra Energy (Sempra), announced in the second quarter of 2018 its plan to sell several assets including its 90.9% interest in Bay Gas. In connection with this decision, Sempra recorded an impairment charge related to Bay Gas adjusting the related assets' carrying values to an estimated fair value. We recorded a reduction in our investment in the non-consolidated affiliate for the proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge. Olin has no other non-consolidated affiliates. On January 1, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for approximately $20 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of approximately $11 million which will be included in first quarter 2019 results.\nDuring 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are predominately commodity markets. We have little or no ability to influence prices in these large, global commodity markets. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nComponents of net periodic benefit (income) costs were:\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, $450.0 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nIn June 2016, we repaid $125.0 million of the 2016 Notes, which became due.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\nWinchester\nWe have designated the April 2016 and October 2016 interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings. Accordingly,\n2018 Compared to 2017\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d which amends ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements.\u201d This update includes adding, modifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied on a prospective basis for certain changes and retrospectively for other changes. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are Toronto-Dominion Bank and SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., both of which are major financial institutions.\nSales for 2017 were $6,268.4 million compared to $5,550.6 million in 2016, an increase of $717.8 million, or 13%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $501.5 million primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Epoxy sales increased by $264.4 million primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Winchester sales decreased by $48.1 million primarily due to decreased shipments to commercial customers, partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. We have little or no ability to influence prices in the large, global commodity markets. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Cyclical price swings, driven by changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\nDuring 2016, Olin entered into arrangements to increase our supply of low cost electricity. These arrangements improve manufacturing flexibility at our Freeport, TX and Plaquemine, LA facilities, reduce our overall electricity cost and accelerate the realization of cost synergies available from the Acquired Business. In conjunction with these arrangements, Olin made payments of $175.7 million during 2016.\ncomponent of income tax (benefit) provision. At December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. During 2018, we increased the deferred tax benefit by $3.9 million as a result of filing the 2017 U.S. and foreign tax returns and decreased the deferred tax benefit by $0.1 million as a result of additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2017 were $3,500.8 million compared to $2,999.3 million for 2016, an increase of $501.5 million, or 17%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $34.0 million, or 47%. The decrease in segment income was due to higher commodity and other material costs ($19.6 million), lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix ($9.4 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by lower operating costs ($3.0 million), including depreciation and amortization expense. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nWinchester reported segment income of $72.4 million for 2017 compared to $120.9 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.5 million, or 40%. The decrease in segment income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($35.0 million), increased commodity and other material costs ($10.6 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of lower operating costs ($5.1 million). Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $19.5 million and $18.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCredits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million for 2018, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities would have been $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2018, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nWe, and our subsidiaries, are defendants in various other legal actions (including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos) incidental to our past and current business activities. We describe some of these matters in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of $15.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively. These liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation and do not include $8.0 million of insurance recoveries included in receivables, net within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. Based on our analysis, and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially and adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities related to litigation to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nThe overall cash decrease of $39.6 million in 2018 primarily reflects our capital spending and long-term debt repayments, net, partially offset by our operating results. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia. Subsequent to the facility's closure, product for customers in the region will be sourced from Winchester manufacturing facilities located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $4.1 million for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, employee severance and related benefit costs and lease and other contract termination costs related to this action. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $1 million related to this closure.\nIn June 2016, we also repaid $125.0 million of 6.75% senior notes (2016 Notes), which became due.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update requires the presentation of the service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The update requires the presentation of the other components of the net periodic benefit (income) costs separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a change in our net periodic benefit (income) costs within operating income, which was offset by a corresponding change in non-operating pension income to reflect the impact of presenting the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service cost and net actuarial loss components of net periodic benefit (income) costs outside of operating income. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a reclassification of $15.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively, from cost of goods sold, and $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively, from selling and administration expenses to non-operating pension income reflecting the aforementioned reclassification on our consolidated statements of operations. The service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs continues to be included in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, we repaid $12.2 million due under the annual requirements of the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes have been repaid.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $2.4 million, which included $51.6 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility and the remaining $12.2 million due under the $97.5 million Series O and $97.5 million Series G SunBelt notes (SunBelt Notes).\nCash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results, which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve, such as the vinyls, urethanes, bleach, ammunition and pulp and paper. Cash flow from operations is affected by changes in chlorine, caustic soda and EDC selling prices caused by the changes in the supply/demand balance of these products, resulting in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment having significant leverage on our earnings and cash flow. For example, assuming all other costs remain constant, internal consumption remains approximately the same and we are operating at full capacity, a $10 selling price change per ton of chlorine equates to an approximate $10 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, a $10 selling price change per ton of caustic soda equates to an approximate $30 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, and a $0.01 selling price change per pound of EDC equates to an approximate $20 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit.\nNet income in 2019 is projected to be approximately $1.60 per diluted share, which includes estimated pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs totaling approximately $80 million. Net income in 2018 was $1.95 per diluted share, which includes pretax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million, pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs of $58.4 million and a pretax non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate of $21.5 million.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2019 segment income is expected to be comparable to 2018 segment income of $637.1 million reflecting improved chlorine, EDC and chlorine-derivatives pricing, which are expected to be offset by lower caustic soda pricing, higher freight and logistics costs, and higher ethylene costs, due to increased ethane pricing.\nGross margin increased $410.5 million, or 58%, from 2017. Gross margin was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $263.8 million, primarily due to higher product pricing partially offset by increased costs, lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy gross margin increased $78.3 million primarily due to higher product prices partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy gross margin was also negatively impacted by the cost of an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX, which also reduced volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy 2017 gross margins were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $34.0 million primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs, lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix and lower selling prices. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 16% in 2018 from 11% in 2017.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nIn 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million compared to $405.8 million for 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher than in the prior year due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was negatively impacted by lower caustic soda volumes, a less favorable product mix and higher costs, including raw material and freight costs, maintenance to improve reliability and depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by the $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n (4) Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 included costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations and permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $76.6 million of these charges were non-cash asset impairment charges for equipment and facilities. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 also included costs associated with the relocation of our Winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from East Alton, IL to Oxford, MS which was completed during 2016. \nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2019 are expected to be higher than 2018 Other Corporate and Unallocated costs of $158.3 million due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project and higher stock based compensation costs partially offset by lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses. Costs associated with the Information Technology Project are estimated to increase approximately $30 million in 2019 compared to 2018, which reflects duplicative costs incurred to maintain legacy systems while transitioning to new systems.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases,\u201d (ASU 2016-02) which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-02, ASC 842 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented. An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption. These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. Adoption of these updates resulted in the recording of additional operating lease assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of between approximately $275 million and $325 million as of January 1, 2019. Our assets and liabilities for finance leases remained unchanged. We also recognized the cumulative effect of applying these updates as an adjustment to retained earnings of between approximately $10 million and $15 million, net of the deferred tax impact, primarily related to the recognition of previously deferred sale/leaseback gains. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this adoption. These updates also impacted our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures related to leases.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2019, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $7.3 million, excluding the $111.0 million of insurance recoveries, in 2018. We do not believe that there will be additional recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods during 2019.\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion above under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d).\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and DowDuPont entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by DowDuPont to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments of $433.5 million on the Closing Date in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics. During 2017, we made an additional payment of $209.4 million in connection with our option to reserve additional ethylene supply at producer economics from DowDuPont. On February 27, 2017, we also exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from DowDuPont. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, an additional payment will be made to DowDuPont of between $440 million and $465 million on or about the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe finalized our purchase price allocation of the Acquisition during the third quarter of 2016. During 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to certain acquisition related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nthe swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of $33.7 million and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in the carrying amount of the related debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $74.7 million of which $3.5 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2018 were $3,986.7 million compared to $3,500.8 million for 2017, an increase of $485.9 million, or 14%. The sales increase was primarily due to increased caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives pricing. The higher product prices were partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls recorded a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to an adjustment to the value of our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas Storage Company, Ltd. (Bay Gas). Bay Gas owns, leases and operates underground gas storage and related pipeline facilities which are used to provide\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11.0 million insurance recovery for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nWinchester sales were $656.3 million for 2018 compared to $681.2 million for 2017, a decrease of $24.9 million, or 4%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($43.4 million), partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($18.5 million).\n2019 OUTLOOK\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Sales and profits are recognized in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment for all caustic soda generated and sold by Olin.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger the two-step impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. Based upon our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2018. No impairment charges were recorded for 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million for 2018 compared to $405.8 million for 2017, an increase of $231.3 million, or 57%. The increase in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was primarily due to higher product prices ($502.9 million) and lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017, partially offset by higher ethane prices ($8.0 million). Partially offsetting these benefits were higher raw material and freight costs ($147.5 million), lower volumes, primarily caustic soda, and a less favorable product mix ($71.1 million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($40.9 million) and increased operating costs ($25.6 million), primarily maintenance to improve reliability. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $111.0 million to the environmental provision, which was net of estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. We incurred legal fees of $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 associated with these recovery actions.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $52.8 million for 2018 compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017, an increase of $64.6 million. The increase in Epoxy segment results was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) partially offset by higher raw material costs ($190.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy results were also negatively impacted by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($42.2 million), higher maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with turnarounds and outages ($23.1 million), increased operating costs, including utilities ($21.3 million) and higher depreciation and amortization expense ($8.1 million). Additionally, Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2017 increased $22.6 million, or 7%, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and contract services of $10.5 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont, and higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses for 2017 also included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2017 and 2016.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total letters of credit of $74.7 million outstanding, of which $3.5 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOn March 21, 2016, we announced that we had made the decision to close a combined total of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Associated with this action, we have permanently closed our Henderson, NV chlor alkali plant with 153,000 tons of capacity and have reconfigured the site to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda and hydrochloric acid. Also, the capacity of our Niagara Falls, NY chlor alkali plant has been reduced from 300,000 tons to 240,000 tons and the chlor alkali capacity at our Freeport, TX facility was reduced by 220,000 tons. This 220,000 ton reduction was entirely from diaphragm cell capacity. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $15.7 million, $32.6 million and $111.3 million, respectively, for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, lease and other contract termination costs, employee severance and related benefit costs, employee relocation costs and facility exit costs related to these actions. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $10 million related to these capacity reductions.\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017. Winchester segment income declined from the prior year primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs and decreased demand for commercial ammunition resulting in lower commercial sales volumes and lower product pricing. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nThe discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the cyclical nature of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable.\nOperating Activities\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2016 included benefits associated with return to provision adjustments, primarily related to salt depletion and non-deductible acquisition costs, and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a change in prior year uncertain tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $3.9 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2016 of 77.2% was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions in combination with a pretax loss.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $8.6 million at December 31, 2018. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nCash Flow Data\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites, have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry. In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs. We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites.\nWinchester 2019 segment income is expected to be similar to the 2018 segment income of $38.4 million primarily due to expected lower commodity and other material costs and lower operating costs offset by declines in commercial demand. Military and other government sales are expected to be consistent with 2018.\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had $125.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on derivative contracts resulted in gains of $5.4 million and $1.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and losses of $5.8 million in 2016 which were included in cost\n (2) For the purposes of this table, we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at December 31, 2018 which ranged from 2.52% to 10.00% and excludes $31.9 million of remaining accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount. \n (7) Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included $16.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.0 million, $3.0 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nOur long-term contractual commitments, including the on and off-balance sheet arrangements, consisted of the following:\nDuring 2017, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased $140 per ton and the caustic soda export price indices increased approximately $260 per metric ton creating positive pricing momentum entering 2018. During 2018, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased an additional $40 per ton while the caustic soda export price indices decreased $270 per metric ton. However, during the second half of 2018 both domestic and export price indices experienced declines.\nEpoxy sales were $2,086.4 million for 2017 compared to $1,822.0 million for 2016, an increase of $264.4 million, or 15%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($52.7 million). Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nWe currently believe that both the 2019 effective tax rate and the cash tax rate will be approximately 25%.\nUnder the Senior Credit Facility, we may select various floating rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As of December 31, 2018, there were no covenants or other restrictions that would have limited our ability to borrow under these facilities.\n (2) Environmental income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2018 included insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Environmental income (expense) is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. \n2018 Compared to 2017\nDuring 2016, $210.0 million was repaid under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, accounts receivable factoring arrangement and Receivables Financing Agreement. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\nIn April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million, and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), PNC Bank, National Association and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASU 2014-09), which amends ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASC 606). Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, ASC 606 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates provide guidance on how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this update recognized at the date of initial application. These updates also expand the disclosure requirements surrounding revenue recorded from contracts with customers. These updates are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The cumulative effect of applying the updates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The most significant impact the updates had was on our accounting policies and disclosures on revenue recognition. Expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition are included within our notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized into earnings. Gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2018 increased $60.8 million, or 16%, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $15.6 million, primarily associated with environmental recovery actions, increased incentive compensation expense of $11.6 million, an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.9 million and higher consulting and contract services of $10.4 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont. These increased costs were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2018 and 2017.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities\u201d which amends ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d (ASC 815). This update is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedge programs. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\nWinchester sales were $681.2 million for 2017 compared to $729.3 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.1 million, or 7%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($89.4 million), partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($41.3 million). The decrease in commercial sales primarily reflects lower demand in shotshell, pistol and rifle ammunition.\nIn 2018, Epoxy generated segment income of $52.8 million compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017. Epoxy segment results were higher than the prior year primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy segment results for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by $23.1 million of additional maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds, which were primarily associated with an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX. Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.7 million. Epoxy segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, long-term debt repayments included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe are party to a dispute relating to a contract at our Plaquemine, LA facility. The other party to the contract has filed a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that Olin breached the related agreement and claiming damages in excess of the amount Olin believes it is obligated to pay under the contract. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for the fourth quarter 2019. Any additional losses related to this contract dispute are not currently estimable because of unresolved questions of fact and law but, if resolved unfavorably to Olin, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 53.3% at December 31, 2018 compared to 56.7% at December 31, 2017, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results, partially offset by the payment of dividends, and a lower level of debt outstanding. The percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 56.7% at December 31, 2017 compared to 61.4% at December 31, 2016, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results partially offset by the payment of dividends.\nFor 2017, other corporate and unallocated costs were $112.4 million compared to $91.4 million for 2016, an increase of $21.0 million, or 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments, increased consulting charges of $7.3 million and costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million.\n (3) Given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans, no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year. Based on the current funding requirements, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2019. During 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $6.0 million. \nEnvironmental\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2019 to be in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $21.7 million in 2018. We expect higher amortization of deferred pension actuarial losses. Based on our plan assumptions and\n2018 Compared to 2017\nestimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2019.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility.\nInterest expense increased by $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates and an increase of $12.1 million of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount, partially offset by a lower level of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (Receivables Financing Agreement). Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $133.6 million, $133.0 million and $132.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On January 25, 2019, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 11, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2019.\nIn 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to the Acquisition for certain acquisition-related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued 0.2 million, 1.7 million and 0.3 million shares, respectively, with a total value of $3.4 million, $32.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively, representing stock options exercised.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nIn 2016, we received $8.8 million from the October 2013 sale of a bleach joint venture.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminates the required quarterly installments under the Term Loan Facility.\nGross margin in 2017 increased $107.4 million, or 18%, from 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $183.6 million, primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were higher electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices, compared to 2016. Epoxy gross margin decreased $26.6 million primarily due to increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy gross margins were also negatively impacted by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages and Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $52.9 million primarily due to lower commercial volumes, a less favorable product mix and increased commodity and other material costs. Gross margin as a percentage of sales were 11% in both 2017 and 2016.\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\n (1) Excludes debt issuance costs and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $67.8 million at December 31, 2018. \nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into a new five-year, $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Credit Facility), which replaced our previous $500.0 million senior revolving credit facility, and a $1,375.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). We recognized interest expense of $1.2 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action during 2017. The proceeds of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility were used to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo credit facility (Sumitomo Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility will mature in March 2022.\nEpoxy sales were $2,303.1 million for 2018 compared to $2,086.4 million for 2017, an increase of $216.7 million, or 10%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) and a favorable effect of foreign currency translation ($48.2 million), partially offset by lower volumes ($153.9 million). Epoxy 2018 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with planned maintenance turnarounds, while 2017 Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\n\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\nof goods sold. At December 31, 2018, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2022 totaling $116.5 million (2017-$92.8 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax loss of $2.6 million.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into the $1,975.0 million Senior Credit Facility, which amended and restated the existing $1,850.0 million senior credit facility. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility was increased to $1,375.0 million, and the aggregate commitments under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility were increased from $500.0 million to $600.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit. In March 2017, we drew the entire $1,375.0 million term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility of $1,282.5 million and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo Credit Facility. The maturity date for the Senior Credit Facility was extended from October 5, 2020 to March 9, 2022. The $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. The Term Loan Facility included amortization payable in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. However, in connection with the $550.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan Facility in January 2018, the required quarterly installments of the Term Loan Facility were eliminated. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we repaid $51.6 million and $67.5 million, respectively, under the required quarterly installments of the term loan facilities.\nFor 2018, other corporate and unallocated costs were $158.3 million compared to $112.4 million for 2017, an increase of $45.9 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $18.0 million and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.6 million. The increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. The higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses were primarily due to legal fees associated with environmental recovery actions.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nWe currently expect the first quarter of 2019 to have the lowest quarterly earnings per diluted share in 2019. We expect the first quarter of 2019 earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels but higher than first quarter 2018 levels. The year over year increase reflects improved pricing for chlorine, ethylene dichloride and chlorine derivatives and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs in the Epoxy business partially offset by the lower year over year caustic soda prices.\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 14 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 18 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 15 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\nIn 2018, we repurchased and retired 2.1 million shares with a total value of $50.0 million under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on April 26, 2018.\nFor 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased by $45.6 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in our operating results. For 2017, working capital decreased $9.8 million compared to a decrease of $80.9 million in 2016. Receivables increased from December 31, 2016 by $49.9 million primarily as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2017, inventories increased by $37.8 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $100.0 million. The increase in inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to an increase in raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene.\nEpoxy\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nRestructuring charges in 2018 and 2017 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges in 2018 were also associated with a December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\n (5) Acquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees. \nOur operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d which amends ASC 230 Statement of Cash Flows.\u201d This update will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The update will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. In connection with this update, we made an accounting policy election to apply the nature of the distribution approach when determining the proper classification of distributions received from equity method investments. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nyears. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nIn October 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on an additional $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are PNC Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo, both of which are major financial institutions.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\nIn 2019, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, including the investment associated with the Information Technology Project of approximately $80 million. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $590 million to $610 million range.\nRestructurings\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and capital lease obligations, of $3,230.3 million, of which $823.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are $125.9 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2020, $0.5 million in 2021, $743.4 million in 2022, $720.3 million in 2023 and a total of $1,706.2 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,230.3 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 were deferred debt issuance costs and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $67.8 million.\n (1) Earnings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates are included in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segment. The losses of non-consolidated affiliates were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during 2018. The earnings of non-consolidated affiliates were $1.8 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $123.7 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $82.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $135.5 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $97.7 million.", "item_7_text": "Epoxy 2019 segment results are expected to improve from the 2018 segment income of $52.8 million as increased volumes, lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs are expected to more than offset lower product pricing.\nDuring 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $6.0 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2019.\n\nOur foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. The effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a (loss) gain of $(5.4) million, $1.8 million and $(11.5) million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIf interest rates were to remain at December 31, 2018 levels, $5.3 million of deferred gains would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual interest rates when the forecasted transactions occur.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nInterest expense increased by $25.5 million in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher interest rates, $3.9 million of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount and the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $2.7 million associated with the redemption of the Sumitomo Credit Facility and a portion of the $1,850.0 million senior credit facility.\nIf commodity prices were to remain at December 31, 2018 levels, approximately $2.3 million of deferred losses, net of tax, would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur.\nDuring 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nAt December 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation of $2,661.9 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $668.9 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nWe have designated these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of $33.7 million and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in the carrying amount of the related debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRestructuring charges in 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $76.6 million of these charges were non-cash asset impairment charges for equipment and facilities. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were also associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014 and the relocation of our Winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from East Alton, IL to Oxford, MS which was completed during 2016.\n (4) These amounts are only estimated payments assuming for our foreign qualified pension plans a weighted average annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 5.2% and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 2.2%. These estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated. In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. \nOur total estimated environmental liability at the end of 2018 was attributable to 60 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 79% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 51 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At three of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. At two of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and at another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part a remedial design is being developed. At one of the nine sites, a remedial action plan is being developed for part of the site and another part is in the long-term OM&M stage. The two remaining sites are in long-term OM&M. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 22% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency. In certain instances such as environmental projects, we are responsible for managing the clean-up and remediation of an environmental site. There exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties. We account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies\u201d and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable.\n (6) Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11.0 million insurance recovery for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident. \nEarnings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates decreased by $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during 2018.\n\n\nWe use interest rate swaps as a means of minimizing cash flow fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates of our variable-rate borrowings. In April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. If all open interest rate swap contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $5.3 million.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $125.6 million at December 31, 2018, and $131.6 million at December 31, 2017, of which $108.6 million and $111.6 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $125.6 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $68.9 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $14.1 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $42.6 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2019 are estimated to be approximately $220 million, of which approximately $17 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $200 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2019 than 2018 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions.\n (8) Non-operating pension income reflects the adoption of ASU 2017-07 and includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs, which are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data. Operating segment results for 2017 and 2016 have been restated to reflect this accounting change. \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d which amends ASC 350. This update will simplify the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This update will require an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The update does not modify the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a prospective basis with earlier application permitted. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2020 and do not expect the update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million.\nThe fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were:\nCharges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $8.5 million for 2017 compared to $9.2 million for 2016. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses and higher Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nIn 2016, we entered into sale/leaseback transactions for railcars that we acquired in connection with the Acquisition. We received proceeds from the sales of $40.4 million.\nNet income was $327.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $549.5 million for 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects a tax benefit of $437.9 million from the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). After adjusting for the provisional benefit of the 2017 Tax Act, the increase in results from the prior year was due to improved Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results, primarily due to higher product prices. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Winchester segment results and increased costs associated with the Information Technology Project. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate and an $8.0 million pretax gain from an insurance recovery resulting from a second quarter 2017 Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility business interruption claim.\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it, and therefore, our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment's business that is strictly commodity.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2017, a payment of $209.4 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. In 2016, payments of $175.7 million were made related to arrangements for the long-term supply of low cost electricity.\nFor 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased by $259.0 million from 2017, primarily due to an increase in operating results, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2018, working capital increased $71.6 million compared to a decrease of $9.8 million in 2017. Receivables increased from December 31, 2017 by $46.3 million primarily as\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $315.0 million. We will continue to service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $1,372.3 million, $1,655.2 million and $533.6 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.3 million, $3.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $132.4 million, $182.3 million and $126.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $405.8 million for 2017 compared to $224.9 million for 2016, an increase of $180.9 million, or 80%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher due to higher product prices ($385.5 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($8.7 million). The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. These increases were partially offset by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($102.5 million) and incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices ($51.6 million), and operating costs ($32.2 million) were also higher compared to 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $432.2 million and $418.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an insurance recovery of $8.0 million in other operating income for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized an insurance recovery of $11.0 million in other operating income for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEpoxy reported a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017 compared to segment income of $15.4 million for 2016, a decrease of $27.2 million. Epoxy segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million) and higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages ($15.3 million). Epoxy segment results were also impacted by increased raw material costs ($227.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene, and higher operating costs ($1.7 million). These decreases impacting segment results were partially offset by higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($33.6 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $94.3 million and $90.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nSales for 2018 were $6,946.1 million compared to $6,268.4 million in 2017, an increase of $677.7 million, or 11%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $485.9 million primarily due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives, partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy sales increased by $216.7 million primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Winchester sales decreased by $24.9 million primarily due to lower sales to commercial customers, partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.\n2018 Overview\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Our discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nUnder ASC 715, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2017, we recorded an after-tax charge of $21.6 million ($27.3 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2017 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 50-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2017. In 2016, we recorded an after-tax charge of $37.5 million ($61.0 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2016 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 30-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2016. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027 (2027 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nGoodwill\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118\u201d (SAB 118) which amends ASC 740 Income Taxes.\u201d This update codifies the guidance in SAB 118. SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. During 2017, we recognized a provisional deferred tax benefit of $437.9 million, which was included as a\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we made long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, of $376.1 million. On January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminated the required quarterly installments under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nAcquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business, and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, $12.2 million was repaid on the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes had been repaid.\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were $500.0 million.\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nDuring 2016, we repaid $67.5 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,350.0 million term loan facility. We also repaid $210.0 million under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement during 2016. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. We recognized interest expense of $1.5 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action in 2017.\nCorporate/Other\n (3) Other corporate and unallocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. \nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\nCapital spending was $385.2 million, $294.3 million and $278.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital spending was 64%, 63% and 64% of depreciation in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2018, we paid debt issuance costs of $8.5 million relating to the 2030 Notes. In 2017, we paid debt issuance costs of $11.2 million relating to the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes. In 2016, we paid debt issuance costs of $1.0 million for the registration of the $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due October 15, 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due October 15, 2025 under the Securities Act of 1933.\nIn connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities relating to releases of hazardous materials and violations of environmental law to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $376.1 million, which included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update includes adding, clarifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with earlier application permitted. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental provisions (credited) charged to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\nInvesting Activities\n\n\nIn February 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d which amends ASC 220 Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income.\u201d This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act during each fiscal year or quarter in which the effect of the lower tax rate is recorded. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update in March 2018 and reclassified $85.9 million related to the deferred gain resulting from the 2017 Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.\n\nstorage in the McIntosh, AL area and delivery of natural gas. The general partner, Sempra Energy (Sempra), announced in the second quarter of 2018 its plan to sell several assets including its 90.9% interest in Bay Gas. In connection with this decision, Sempra recorded an impairment charge related to Bay Gas adjusting the related assets' carrying values to an estimated fair value. We recorded a reduction in our investment in the non-consolidated affiliate for the proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge. Olin has no other non-consolidated affiliates. On January 1, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for approximately $20 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of approximately $11 million which will be included in first quarter 2019 results.\nDuring 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project is anticipated to be completed during 2020. Total capital spending is forecast to be $250 million and associated expenses are forecast to be $100 million. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $84.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of capital spending and $36.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are predominately commodity markets. We have little or no ability to influence prices in these large, global commodity markets. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nComponents of net periodic benefit (income) costs were:\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, $450.0 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nIn June 2016, we repaid $125.0 million of the 2016 Notes, which became due.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\nWinchester\nWe have designated the April 2016 and October 2016 interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings. Accordingly,\n2018 Compared to 2017\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d which amends ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements.\u201d This update includes adding, modifying and removing various disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied on a prospective basis for certain changes and retrospectively for other changes. We adopted this update on December 31, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are Toronto-Dominion Bank and SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., both of which are major financial institutions.\nSales for 2017 were $6,268.4 million compared to $5,550.6 million in 2016, an increase of $717.8 million, or 13%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales increased by $501.5 million primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Epoxy sales increased by $264.4 million primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Winchester sales decreased by $48.1 million primarily due to decreased shipments to commercial customers, partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. We have little or no ability to influence prices in the large, global commodity markets. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Cyclical price swings, driven by changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\nDuring 2016, Olin entered into arrangements to increase our supply of low cost electricity. These arrangements improve manufacturing flexibility at our Freeport, TX and Plaquemine, LA facilities, reduce our overall electricity cost and accelerate the realization of cost synergies available from the Acquired Business. In conjunction with these arrangements, Olin made payments of $175.7 million during 2016.\ncomponent of income tax (benefit) provision. At December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. During 2018, we increased the deferred tax benefit by $3.9 million as a result of filing the 2017 U.S. and foreign tax returns and decreased the deferred tax benefit by $0.1 million as a result of additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2017 were $3,500.8 million compared to $2,999.3 million for 2016, an increase of $501.5 million, or 17%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices and increased volumes. The higher product prices and increased volumes were primarily related to caustic soda and EDC. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $34.0 million, or 47%. The decrease in segment income was due to higher commodity and other material costs ($19.6 million), lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix ($9.4 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by lower operating costs ($3.0 million), including depreciation and amortization expense. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nWinchester reported segment income of $72.4 million for 2017 compared to $120.9 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.5 million, or 40%. The decrease in segment income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($35.0 million), increased commodity and other material costs ($10.6 million) and lower product prices ($8.0 million). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of lower operating costs ($5.1 million). Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $19.5 million and $18.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCredits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million for 2018, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities would have been $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2018, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nWe, and our subsidiaries, are defendants in various other legal actions (including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos) incidental to our past and current business activities. We describe some of these matters in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of $15.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively. These liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation and do not include $8.0 million of insurance recoveries included in receivables, net within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. Based on our analysis, and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially and adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In connection with the October 5, 2015 acquisition of DowDuPont's U.S. Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses, the prior owner of the businesses retained liabilities related to litigation to the extent arising prior to October 5, 2015.\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nThe overall cash decrease of $39.6 million in 2018 primarily reflects our capital spending and long-term debt repayments, net, partially offset by our operating results. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia. Subsequent to the facility's closure, product for customers in the region will be sourced from Winchester manufacturing facilities located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $4.1 million for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, employee severance and related benefit costs and lease and other contract termination costs related to this action. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $1 million related to this closure.\nIn June 2016, we also repaid $125.0 million of 6.75% senior notes (2016 Notes), which became due.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\u201d which amends ASC 715. This update requires the presentation of the service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The update requires the presentation of the other components of the net periodic benefit (income) costs separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance in this update is applied on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a change in our net periodic benefit (income) costs within operating income, which was offset by a corresponding change in non-operating pension income to reflect the impact of presenting the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service cost and net actuarial loss components of net periodic benefit (income) costs outside of operating income. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a reclassification of $15.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively, from cost of goods sold, and $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively, from selling and administration expenses to non-operating pension income reflecting the aforementioned reclassification on our consolidated statements of operations. The service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs continues to be included in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period.\nIn December 2017 and 2016, we repaid $12.2 million due under the annual requirements of the SunBelt Notes. At December 31, 2017, all amounts due under the SunBelt Notes have been repaid.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our long-term debt repayments, net of long-term debt borrowings, were $2.4 million, which included $51.6 million under the required quarterly installments of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility and the remaining $12.2 million due under the $97.5 million Series O and $97.5 million Series G SunBelt notes (SunBelt Notes).\nCash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results, which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve, such as the vinyls, urethanes, bleach, ammunition and pulp and paper. Cash flow from operations is affected by changes in chlorine, caustic soda and EDC selling prices caused by the changes in the supply/demand balance of these products, resulting in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment having significant leverage on our earnings and cash flow. For example, assuming all other costs remain constant, internal consumption remains approximately the same and we are operating at full capacity, a $10 selling price change per ton of chlorine equates to an approximate $10 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, a $10 selling price change per ton of caustic soda equates to an approximate $30 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit, and a $0.01 selling price change per pound of EDC equates to an approximate $20 million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit.\nNet income in 2019 is projected to be approximately $1.60 per diluted share, which includes estimated pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs totaling approximately $80 million. Net income in 2018 was $1.95 per diluted share, which includes pretax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million, pretax information technology integration project costs and restructuring costs of $58.4 million and a pretax non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate of $21.5 million.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2019 segment income is expected to be comparable to 2018 segment income of $637.1 million reflecting improved chlorine, EDC and chlorine-derivatives pricing, which are expected to be offset by lower caustic soda pricing, higher freight and logistics costs, and higher ethylene costs, due to increased ethane pricing.\nGross margin increased $410.5 million, or 58%, from 2017. Gross margin was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $263.8 million, primarily due to higher product pricing partially offset by increased costs, lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy gross margin increased $78.3 million primarily due to higher product prices partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy gross margin was also negatively impacted by the cost of an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX, which also reduced volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy 2017 gross margins were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $34.0 million primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs, lower commercial sales volumes and a less favorable product mix and lower selling prices. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 16% in 2018 from 11% in 2017.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nIn 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million compared to $405.8 million for 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was higher than in the prior year due to increased pricing for caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was negatively impacted by lower caustic soda volumes, a less favorable product mix and higher costs, including raw material and freight costs, maintenance to improve reliability and depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by the $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.0 million. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n (4) Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 included costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations and permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $76.6 million of these charges were non-cash asset impairment charges for equipment and facilities. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 also included costs associated with the relocation of our Winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from East Alton, IL to Oxford, MS which was completed during 2016. \nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2019 are expected to be higher than 2018 Other Corporate and Unallocated costs of $158.3 million due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project and higher stock based compensation costs partially offset by lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses. Costs associated with the Information Technology Project are estimated to increase approximately $30 million in 2019 compared to 2018, which reflects duplicative costs incurred to maintain legacy systems while transitioning to new systems.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases,\u201d (ASU 2016-02) which supersedes ASC 840 Leases\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 842 Leases.\u201d Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-02, ASC 842 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented. An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption. These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. Adoption of these updates resulted in the recording of additional operating lease assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of between approximately $275 million and $325 million as of January 1, 2019. Our assets and liabilities for finance leases remained unchanged. We also recognized the cumulative effect of applying these updates as an adjustment to retained earnings of between approximately $10 million and $15 million, net of the deferred tax impact, primarily related to the recognition of previously deferred sale/leaseback gains. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this adoption. These updates also impacted our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures related to leases.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2019, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $7.3 million, excluding the $111.0 million of insurance recoveries, in 2018. We do not believe that there will be additional recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods during 2019.\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion above under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d).\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and DowDuPont entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by DowDuPont to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments of $433.5 million on the Closing Date in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics. During 2017, we made an additional payment of $209.4 million in connection with our option to reserve additional ethylene supply at producer economics from DowDuPont. On February 27, 2017, we also exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from DowDuPont. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, an additional payment will be made to DowDuPont of between $440 million and $465 million on or about the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe finalized our purchase price allocation of the Acquisition during the third quarter of 2016. During 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to certain acquisition related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nthe swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of $33.7 million and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in the carrying amount of the related debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $2.1 million of expense has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of income has been recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $74.7 million of which $3.5 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2018 were $3,986.7 million compared to $3,500.8 million for 2017, an increase of $485.9 million, or 14%. The sales increase was primarily due to increased caustic soda, EDC, chlorine and other chlorine-derivatives pricing. The higher product prices were partially offset by lower caustic soda volumes and a less favorable product mix. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls recorded a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to an adjustment to the value of our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas Storage Company, Ltd. (Bay Gas). Bay Gas owns, leases and operates underground gas storage and related pipeline facilities which are used to provide\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11.0 million insurance recovery for property damage and business interruption related to a 2008 chlor alkali facility incident.\nWinchester sales were $656.3 million for 2018 compared to $681.2 million for 2017, a decrease of $24.9 million, or 4%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($43.4 million), partially offset by higher sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($18.5 million).\n2019 OUTLOOK\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Sales and profits are recognized in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment for all caustic soda generated and sold by Olin.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger the two-step impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. Based upon our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2018. No impairment charges were recorded for 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $637.1 million for 2018 compared to $405.8 million for 2017, an increase of $231.3 million, or 57%. The increase in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income was primarily due to higher product prices ($502.9 million) and lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDuPont in late September 2017, partially offset by higher ethane prices ($8.0 million). Partially offsetting these benefits were higher raw material and freight costs ($147.5 million), lower volumes, primarily caustic soda, and a less favorable product mix ($71.1 million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($40.9 million) and increased operating costs ($25.6 million), primarily maintenance to improve reliability. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment income was also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2017 segment income was negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.0 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $473.1 million and $432.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $111.0 million to the environmental provision, which was net of estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. We incurred legal fees of $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 associated with these recovery actions.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $52.8 million for 2018 compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017, an increase of $64.6 million. The increase in Epoxy segment results was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) partially offset by higher raw material costs ($190.8 million), primarily benzene and propylene. Epoxy results were also negatively impacted by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix ($42.2 million), higher maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with turnarounds and outages ($23.1 million), increased operating costs, including utilities ($21.3 million) and higher depreciation and amortization expense ($8.1 million). Additionally, Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey ($27.7 million). Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2017 increased $22.6 million, or 7%, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and contract services of $10.5 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont, and higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses for 2017 also included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2017 and 2016.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total letters of credit of $74.7 million outstanding, of which $3.5 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOn March 21, 2016, we announced that we had made the decision to close a combined total of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Associated with this action, we have permanently closed our Henderson, NV chlor alkali plant with 153,000 tons of capacity and have reconfigured the site to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda and hydrochloric acid. Also, the capacity of our Niagara Falls, NY chlor alkali plant has been reduced from 300,000 tons to 240,000 tons and the chlor alkali capacity at our Freeport, TX facility was reduced by 220,000 tons. This 220,000 ton reduction was entirely from diaphragm cell capacity. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $15.7 million, $32.6 million and $111.3 million, respectively, for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, lease and other contract termination costs, employee severance and related benefit costs, employee relocation costs and facility exit costs related to these actions. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2019 of approximately $10 million related to these capacity reductions.\nWinchester reported segment income of $38.4 million for 2018 compared to $72.4 million for 2017. Winchester segment income declined from the prior year primarily due to increased commodity and other material costs and decreased demand for commercial ammunition resulting in lower commercial sales volumes and lower product pricing. Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and $19.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility.\nThe discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the cyclical nature of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable.\nOperating Activities\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2016 included benefits associated with return to provision adjustments, primarily related to salt depletion and non-deductible acquisition costs, and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a change in prior year uncertain tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $3.9 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2016 of 77.2% was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions in combination with a pretax loss.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $8.6 million at December 31, 2018. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nCash Flow Data\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites, have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry. In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs. We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites.\nWinchester 2019 segment income is expected to be similar to the 2018 segment income of $38.4 million primarily due to expected lower commodity and other material costs and lower operating costs offset by declines in commercial demand. Military and other government sales are expected to be consistent with 2018.\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had $125.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on derivative contracts resulted in gains of $5.4 million and $1.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and losses of $5.8 million in 2016 which were included in cost\n (2) For the purposes of this table, we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at December 31, 2018 which ranged from 2.52% to 10.00% and excludes $31.9 million of remaining accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount. \n (7) Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included $16.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.0 million, $3.0 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nOur long-term contractual commitments, including the on and off-balance sheet arrangements, consisted of the following:\nDuring 2017, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased $140 per ton and the caustic soda export price indices increased approximately $260 per metric ton creating positive pricing momentum entering 2018. During 2018, North America caustic soda price contract indices increased an additional $40 per ton while the caustic soda export price indices decreased $270 per metric ton. However, during the second half of 2018 both domestic and export price indices experienced declines.\nEpoxy sales were $2,086.4 million for 2017 compared to $1,822.0 million for 2016, an increase of $264.4 million, or 15%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($211.7 million) and increased volumes and a more favorable product mix ($52.7 million). Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\nWe currently believe that both the 2019 effective tax rate and the cash tax rate will be approximately 25%.\nUnder the Senior Credit Facility, we may select various floating rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As of December 31, 2018, there were no covenants or other restrictions that would have limited our ability to borrow under these facilities.\n (2) Environmental income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2018 included insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Environmental income (expense) is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. \n2018 Compared to 2017\nDuring 2016, $210.0 million was repaid under the Sumitomo Credit Facility using proceeds from the Receivables Financing Agreement. During 2017, the remaining balance of $590.0 million was repaid using proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility and the 2027 Notes.\nOn March 9, 2017, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due September 15, 2027, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2027 Notes began accruing from March 9, 2017 and is paid semi-annually beginning on September 15, 2017. Proceeds from the 2027 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, accounts receivable factoring arrangement and Receivables Financing Agreement. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\nIn April 2016, we entered into three tranches of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we agreed to pay fixed rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us floating rates on $1,100.0 million, $900.0 million, and $400.0 million of our underlying floating-rate debt obligations. Each tranche's term length is for twelve months beginning on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The counterparties to the agreements are SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), PNC Bank, National Association and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These counterparties are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. We have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in interest payments associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Accordingly, the remaining swap agreement has been recorded at its fair market value of $5.3 million and is included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, with the corresponding gain deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $8.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASU 2014-09), which amends ASC 605 Revenue Recognition\u201d and creates a new topic, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (ASC 606). Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, ASC 606 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update. These updates provide guidance on how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this update recognized at the date of initial application. These updates also expand the disclosure requirements surrounding revenue recorded from contracts with customers. These updates are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The cumulative effect of applying the updates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The most significant impact the updates had was on our accounting policies and disclosures on revenue recognition. Expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition are included within our notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized into earnings. Gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2018 increased $60.8 million, or 16%, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $15.6 million, primarily associated with environmental recovery actions, increased incentive compensation expense of $11.6 million, an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.9 million and higher consulting and contract services of $10.4 million, which include transition service fees from DowDuPont. These increased costs were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 6% in both 2018 and 2017.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities\u201d which amends ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d (ASC 815). This update is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedge programs. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\nWinchester sales were $681.2 million for 2017 compared to $729.3 million for 2016, a decrease of $48.1 million, or 7%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower ammunition sales to commercial customers ($89.4 million), partially offset by increased shipments to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($41.3 million). The decrease in commercial sales primarily reflects lower demand in shotshell, pistol and rifle ammunition.\nIn 2018, Epoxy generated segment income of $52.8 million compared to a segment loss of $11.8 million for 2017. Epoxy segment results were higher than the prior year primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Epoxy segment results for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by $23.1 million of additional maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds, which were primarily associated with an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at our production facilities in Freeport, TX. Epoxy 2017 segment results were negatively impacted by incremental costs to continue operations and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with Hurricane Harvey of $27.7 million. Epoxy segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of $102.4 million and $94.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, long-term debt repayments included $780.4 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility, $124.7 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement and $20.0 million related to the $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe are party to a dispute relating to a contract at our Plaquemine, LA facility. The other party to the contract has filed a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that Olin breached the related agreement and claiming damages in excess of the amount Olin believes it is obligated to pay under the contract. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for the fourth quarter 2019. Any additional losses related to this contract dispute are not currently estimable because of unresolved questions of fact and law but, if resolved unfavorably to Olin, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 53.3% at December 31, 2018 compared to 56.7% at December 31, 2017, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results, partially offset by the payment of dividends, and a lower level of debt outstanding. The percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 56.7% at December 31, 2017 compared to 61.4% at December 31, 2016, resulting from higher shareholders' equity primarily due to our operating results partially offset by the payment of dividends.\nFor 2017, other corporate and unallocated costs were $112.4 million compared to $91.4 million for 2016, an increase of $21.0 million, or 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments, increased consulting charges of $7.3 million and costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $5.3 million.\n (3) Given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans, no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year. Based on the current funding requirements, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2019. During 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $6.0 million. \nEnvironmental\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2019 to be in the $15 million to $20 million range compared to $21.7 million in 2018. We expect higher amortization of deferred pension actuarial losses. Based on our plan assumptions and\n2018 Compared to 2017\nestimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2019.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $3.3 million from the sale of a former manufacturing facility.\nInterest expense increased by $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates and an increase of $12.1 million of accretion expense related to the 2020 ethylene payment discount, partially offset by a lower level of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nOn December 20, 2016, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (Receivables Financing Agreement). Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the leverage and coverage covenants that are contained in the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $125.0 million and $249.7 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the Receivables Financing Agreement and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the payment to DowDuPont associated with a long-term ethylene supply contract to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the proceeds of the Receivables Financing Agreement were used to repay $210.0 million of the Sumitomo Credit Facility.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $133.6 million, $133.0 million and $132.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On January 25, 2019, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 11, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2019.\nIn 2016, payments of $69.5 million were made related to the Acquisition for certain acquisition-related liabilities including the final working capital adjustment.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued 0.2 million, 1.7 million and 0.3 million shares, respectively, with a total value of $3.4 million, $32.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively, representing stock options exercised.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nIn 2016, we received $8.8 million from the October 2013 sale of a bleach joint venture.\nOn January 19, 2018, Olin issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the 2030 Notes began accruing from January 19, 2018 and is paid semi-annually beginning on August 1, 2018. Proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to redeem $550.0 million of debt under the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility. This prepayment of the Term Loan Facility eliminates the required quarterly installments under the Term Loan Facility.\nGross margin in 2017 increased $107.4 million, or 18%, from 2016. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin increased by $183.6 million, primarily due to higher caustic soda and EDC product prices and increased volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were higher electricity costs, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices, compared to 2016. Epoxy gross margin decreased $26.6 million primarily due to increased raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by higher product prices and increased volumes. Both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy gross margins were also negatively impacted by higher maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with turnarounds and outages and Hurricane Harvey. Winchester gross margin decreased $52.9 million primarily due to lower commercial volumes, a less favorable product mix and increased commodity and other material costs. Gross margin as a percentage of sales were 11% in both 2017 and 2016.\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\n (1) Excludes debt issuance costs and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $67.8 million at December 31, 2018. \nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into a new five-year, $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Credit Facility), which replaced our previous $500.0 million senior revolving credit facility, and a $1,375.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). We recognized interest expense of $1.2 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to this action during 2017. The proceeds of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility were used to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo credit facility (Sumitomo Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility will mature in March 2022.\nEpoxy sales were $2,303.1 million for 2018 compared to $2,086.4 million for 2017, an increase of $216.7 million, or 10%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher product prices ($322.4 million) and a favorable effect of foreign currency translation ($48.2 million), partially offset by lower volumes ($153.9 million). Epoxy 2018 sales volumes were negatively impacted by lost sales associated with planned maintenance turnarounds, while 2017 Epoxy sales volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey.\n\na result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2018, inventories increased by $35.5 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $14.5 million. The increases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to higher raw material costs. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily related to the Information Technology Project.\nof goods sold. At December 31, 2018, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2022 totaling $116.5 million (2017-$92.8 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2018, we would have recognized a pretax loss of $2.6 million.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nOn March 9, 2017, we entered into the $1,975.0 million Senior Credit Facility, which amended and restated the existing $1,850.0 million senior credit facility. Pursuant to the agreement, the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Facility was increased to $1,375.0 million, and the aggregate commitments under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility were increased from $500.0 million to $600.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we had $596.5 million available under our $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit. In March 2017, we drew the entire $1,375.0 million term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining balance of the existing $1,350.0 million term loan facility of $1,282.5 million and a portion of the $800.0 million Sumitomo Credit Facility. The maturity date for the Senior Credit Facility was extended from October 5, 2020 to March 9, 2022. The $600.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. The Term Loan Facility included amortization payable in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. However, in connection with the $550.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan Facility in January 2018, the required quarterly installments of the Term Loan Facility were eliminated. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we repaid $51.6 million and $67.5 million, respectively, under the required quarterly installments of the term loan facilities.\nFor 2018, other corporate and unallocated costs were $158.3 million compared to $112.4 million for 2017, an increase of $45.9 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $31.2 million, higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $18.0 million and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $10.6 million. The increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $15.0 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. The higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses were primarily due to legal fees associated with environmental recovery actions.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nWe currently expect the first quarter of 2019 to have the lowest quarterly earnings per diluted share in 2019. We expect the first quarter of 2019 earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels but higher than first quarter 2018 levels. The year over year increase reflects improved pricing for chlorine, ethylene dichloride and chlorine derivatives and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs in the Epoxy business partially offset by the lower year over year caustic soda prices.\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 14 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 18 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 15 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\nIn 2018, we repurchased and retired 2.1 million shares with a total value of $50.0 million under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on April 26, 2018.\nFor 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased by $45.6 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in our operating results. For 2017, working capital decreased $9.8 million compared to a decrease of $80.9 million in 2016. Receivables increased from December 31, 2016 by $49.9 million primarily as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2017, inventories increased by $37.8 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $100.0 million. The increase in inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to an increase in raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene.\nEpoxy\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2017 included benefits associated with the 2017 Tax Act, an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on prior period tax examinations, stock based compensation, U.S. federal tax credits, changes to prior year tax positions and a reduction to the deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate also included an expense associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance, primarily related to foreign net operating losses and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $452.3 million tax benefit, of which $437.9 million was a provisional benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 of 17.1% was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nRestructuring charges in 2018 and 2017 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges in 2018 were also associated with a December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\n (5) Acquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were related to the integration of the Acquired Business and consisted of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees. \nOur operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d which amends ASC 230 Statement of Cash Flows.\u201d This update will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The update will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We adopted this update on January 1, 2018. In connection with this update, we made an accounting policy election to apply the nature of the distribution approach when determining the proper classification of distributions received from equity method investments. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nyears. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, which includes approximately $80 million of capital spending related to the Information Technology Project.\nIn October 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps on an additional $250.0 million of our underlying fixed-rate debt obligations, whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to the counterparties who, in turn, pay us fixed rates. The counterparties to these agreements are PNC Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo, both of which are major financial institutions.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\nIn 2019, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $375 million to $425 million range, including the investment associated with the Information Technology Project of approximately $80 million. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $590 million to $610 million range.\nRestructurings\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and capital lease obligations, of $3,230.3 million, of which $823.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are $125.9 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2020, $0.5 million in 2021, $743.4 million in 2022, $720.3 million in 2023 and a total of $1,706.2 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,230.3 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 were deferred debt issuance costs and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $67.8 million.\n (1) Earnings (losses) of non-consolidated affiliates are included in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segment. The losses of non-consolidated affiliates were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during 2018. The earnings of non-consolidated affiliates were $1.8 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $123.7 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $82.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could be significant to our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $135.5 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $97.7 million.",
