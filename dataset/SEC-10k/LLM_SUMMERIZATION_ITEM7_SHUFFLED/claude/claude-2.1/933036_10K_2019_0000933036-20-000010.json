Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRecent Developments\nSale/Partial Leaseback of Corporate Headquarters\nOn December 27, 2019, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters for proceeds of $43.2 million, and entered into a lease agreement for a reduced portion, approximately 60%, of the total square footage of the building. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The lease includes an initial term of 12 years, with two five year renewal option periods at our discretion.\nResults of Operations\nWe report financial operating performance under four operating segments. To better reflect the Company's current strategic focus, our retail partner business operations are now reported as the Preferred Lease segment (formerly Acceptance Now), which includes our virtual, staffed and hybrid business models; and our company-owned stores and e-commerce platform through rentacenter.com, are now reported as the Rent-A-Center Business segment (formerly Core U.S.). In addition, we report operating results for our Mexico and Franchising segments.\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nVirtual Business Model\nOn August 13, 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp. dba Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide provider of virtual lease-to-own services, accelerating our growth in the virtual lease-to-own industry. In addition, in January 2020, we announced plans for our new integrated retail partner offering under Preferred Lease, which combines our staffed and virtual lease-to-own business models to meet the needs and expectations of both our customers and retail partners. While we believe the acquisition of the Merchants Preferred virtual business model and rollout of our Preferred Lease integrated offering positions us for significant revenue and earnings growth, we are exposed to potential operating margin degradation due to the higher cost of merchandise in our retail partner business and potential for higher merchandise losses.\nCost Savings Initiatives\nIn 2018, we initiated and executed multiple cost savings initiatives, resulting in reductions in overhead and supply chain costs. While these initiatives have led to significant decreases in operating expenses and corresponding improvement in operating profit on a year-over-year basis in our 2018 and 2019 consolidated operating results, we do not expect to continue to realize cost reduction benefits at the same annualized rate in future periods.\nOverview\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, consolidated revenues decreased approximately $9.4 million, primarily driven by the sale of company owned stores to franchisees and closures of certain Rent-A-Center Business stores, partially offset by increased same store sales. Operating profit, however, increased approximately $197.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to receipt of a payment of $92.5 million in cash in May 2019 relating to the settlement on April 22, 2019 of all litigation with Vintage Rodeo Parent, LLC, Vintage Rodeo Acquisition, Inc., Vintage Capital Management, LLC and B. Riley Financial, Inc. (the \"Vintage Settlement\"); and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, reduced operating expenses related to costs savings initiatives and store closures.\nRevenues in our Rent-A-Center Business segment decreased approximately $55.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driven by the refranchising of approximately 100 locations in the past 12 months and rationalization of the Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase in same store sales. Operating profit increased $88.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in store labor and other store expenses driven by lower store count and cost savings initiatives.\nThe Preferred Lease segment revenues increased approximately $26.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and an increase in same store sales. Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased 2.4% primarily due to value proposition changes. Operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9% primarily\ndue to a decrease in gross profit, in addition to higher merchandise losses, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nThe Mexico segment revenues increased by 8.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driving an increase in operating profit of 105.6%, or $2.8 million.\nCash flow from operations was $215.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. We paid down debt by $303.2 million during the year, ending the period with $70.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion that follows.\nTable 91:

Total store revenue decreased by $23.6 million, or 0.9%, to $2,604.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $2,627.9 million for 2018. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $55.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, partially offset by an increase of $26.7 million in the Preferred Lease segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 2,762 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the impact of hurricanes, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues increased by $82.4 million, or 4.6%, to $1,873.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,791.4 million in 2018. The increase in same store revenues was primarily attributable to an improvement in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $13.0 million, or 2.1%, to $634.9 million, as compared to $621.9 million in 2018. The increase in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to an increase of $31.5 million in the Preferred Lease segment as a result of higher rentals and fees revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 27.7% in 2018.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold increased by $10.1 million, or 3.3%, to $319.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $308.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to increases of $9.3 million and $1.0 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to (4.7)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from (1.5)% in 2018.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $44.1 million, or 2.6%, to $1,644.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1,688.2 million in 2018, due primarily to decreases of $44.7 million and $5.8 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively partially offset by increases of $3.3 million and $3.1 million in the Franchising and Mexico segments, respectively, in each case as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 61.6% in 2019 compared to 63.5% in 2018.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $53.3 million, or 7.8%, to $630.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $683.4 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $53.7 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, driven by our cost savings initiatives and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base (see Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail). Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 26.0% in 2018.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $39.8 million, or 6.1%, to $617.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $656.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $55.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as a result of lower Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase of $13.1 million in the Preferred Lease segment primarily related to merchandise losses. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 25.0% in 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses decreased by $20.8 million, or 12.7%, to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $163.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of our cost savings initiatives. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 6.1% in 2018.\nOther (Gains) and Charges. Other charges decreased by $120.0 million, or 202.4%, to $(60.7) million in 2019, as compared to $59.3 million in 2018. Other gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily related to receipt of the Vintage Settlement\nProceeds and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by merger termination and other incremental legal and professional fees, legal settlements, state sales tax audit assessments, acquisition transaction fees, and charges related to cost savings initiatives and store closures. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit increased $197.8 million, or 352.2%, to $253.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $56.1 million in 2018, primarily due to an increase of $114.9 million in the Corporate segment primarily due to the other gains discussed above, and an increase of $88.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance sections below. Operating profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2.1% for 2018. Excluding other charges, profit was $193.1 million or 7.2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $115.5 million or 4.3% of revenue for the comparable period of 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense.

Total store revenue decreased by $52.5 million, or 2.0%, to $2,627.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $2,680.4 million for 2017. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $75.4 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 2,575 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues increased by $74.8 million, or 4.7%, to $1,653.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1,578.6 million in 2017.

Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 27.3% in 2017.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $87.3 million,\nor 11.7%, to $656.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $744.2 million in 2017, primarily attributable to decreases of $51.6 million and $37.5 million in the Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments, respectively, as a result of lower customer stolen merchandise losses for Preferred Lease and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 27.8% in 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $215.4 million in operating cash flow, including approximately $80 million of net pre-tax proceeds from the Vintage Settlement. We paid down debt by $303.2 million, and used cash of $28.9 million for the acquisition of businesses, and $21.2 million for capital expenditures. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of property assets of $69.7 million, ending the year with $70.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $12.1 million to $215.4 million in 2019 from $227.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher inventory purchases during the twelve months ended December\n31, 2019, in addition to the prior year receipt of our federal income tax refund in 2018 of approximately $35.2 million, partially offset by the receipt of the Vintage Settlement Proceeds in 2019.\nCash provided by investing activities increased approximately $25.5 million to $20.8 million in 2019 from $(4.7) million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property assets of approximately $44.4 million, partially offset by an increase of approximately $26.9 million in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nCash used in financing activities increased by $181.3 million to $321.6 million in 2019 from $140.3 million in 2018, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $303.2 million in 2019, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $139.3 million in 2018. In addition, we increased dividend payments by $13.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets, debt service, and dividends. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Should we require additional funding sources, we maintain a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Credit Facility\"), with commitments of $300 million, provided for under the Asset Based Loan Credit Agreement, entered into on August 5, 2019 (the \"ABLE Credit Agreement\"). We utilize our ABL Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities.\nWe believe cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations during the next 12 months. At February 21, 2020, we had approximately $36.2 million in cash on hand, and $168.2 million available under our ABL Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019.\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2017 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through September 26, 2017, when it was updated by the Tax Act. The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The bonus depreciation provided by the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $194 million for us in 2019. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with bonus depreciation from this act is approximately $239 million at December 31, 2019, of which approximately 78%, or $189 million, will reverse in 2020, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2021 and 2022.\nMerchandise Losses. Merchandise losses consist of the following:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer stolen merchandise\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other merchandise losses(1)\n</td> <td>25,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total merchandise losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Expenditures. We make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores, and investment in information technology. We spent $21.2 million, $28.0 million and $65.5 million on capital expenditures in the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAcquisitions and New Location Openings. On August 13, 2019, we completed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp d/b/a Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide virtual lease-to-own provider, for total consideration of approximately $46.3 million. In addition, during 2019, we acquired four new Rent-A-Center Business locations and customer accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.5 million in three transactions.

As discussed in Notes J and K to the consolidated financial statements, in August 2019, we completed the refinancing of our prior revolving facility and effective August 5, 2019, redeemed in full our unsecured senior notes using cash on hand and proceeds from our new $300 million ABL Credit Facility and $200 million from a new term loan under our ABL Credit Agreement. We may use, subject to certain limitations and borrowing availability, $150 million under our ABL Credit Agreement for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $89 million had been so utilized as of February 21, 2020. The ABL Credit Agreement has a scheduled maturity of August 5, 2024.\nStore Leases. We lease space for all of our Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico stores under operating leases expiring at various times through 2026. In addition we lease space for certain support facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2032. Most of our store leases are five year leases and contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years at rental rates adjusted according to agreed-upon formulas.\nContractual Cash Commitments.

Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.7 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based\non known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $97.3 million, as compared to $101.6 million at December 31, 2018. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nRental Merchandise. Rental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for merchandise is generally provided using the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt of rental revenue over the rental purchase agreement period. Under the income forecasting method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which is an activity-based method similar to the units of production method. We depreciate merchandise (including computers and tablets) that is held for rent for at least 180 consecutive days using the straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed 18 months. Beginning in 2016, smartphones are depreciated over an 18-month straight-line basis beginning with the earlier of on rent or 90 consecutive days on held for rent.\nRental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable is expensed when such impairment occurs. In addition, any minor repairs made to rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair. If a customer does not return merchandise on-rent or make a payment, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on or before the 90th day following the time the account became past due in the Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, and during the month following the 150th day in the Preferred Lease segment. We maintain a reserve for these expected losses, which estimates the merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period based on a combination of historical write-offs and expected future losses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserve for merchandise losses was $55.2 million and $42.6 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available.\nValuation of Goodwill. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors which could necessitate an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in our market capitalization, prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.\nWe use a two-step approach to assess goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the goodwill is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, we perform a second analysis to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities within the reporting unit, and if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As an alternative to this annual impairment testing, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment for impairment if it believes it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nOur reporting units are our reportable operating segments identified in Note S to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable but inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, future cash flows based on revenue growth rates and operating margins, and future economic and market conditions approximated by a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve the expected growth rates or operating margins include, but are not limited to, the general strength of the economy and other economic conditions that affect consumer preferences and spending and factors that affect the disposable income of our current and potential customers. Factors that could affect our weighted average cost of capital include changes in interest rates and changes in our effective tax rate.\nDuring the period from our 2018 goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter 2019, we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compared estimated fair value of the company, as determined based on the consolidated stock price, to its net book value. As the estimated fair value of the company was higher than its net book value during each of these periods, no additional testing was deemed necessary.\nWe completed a qualitative assessment for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2019, concluding it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeded the reporting unit's fair value.\nAt December 31, 2019, the amount of goodwill allocated to the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments was $1.5 million and $68.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 the amount of goodwill allocated to the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments was $1.5 million and $55.3 million, respectively.\nBased on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we do not suggest that other general risk factors, such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired locations, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires immediate recognition of estimated current expected credit losses, rather than recognition when incurred. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. Adoption is required using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption. We believe application of this ASU is limited to our installment notes receivables and trade receivables with our franchisees, primarily related to merchandise sales. Based on the limited scope in which we believe this ASU applies to our business, we do not expect the impact of adoption to be material to our financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the hypothetical purchase price allocation and instead using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 will be required for us on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements in ASC 820, to improve the effectiveness of the fair value measurement disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40); Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements (CCAs) to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing agreement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2021. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not\nyet effective are either not applicable to us at this time or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "Revenues in our Rent-A-Center Business segment decreased approximately $55.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driven by the refranchising of approximately 100 locations in the past 12 months and rationalization of the Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase in same store sales. Operating profit increased $88.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in store labor and other store expenses driven by lower store count and cost savings initiatives.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit decreased by 11.6% compared to 2018, primarily due to decline in gross profit described above and higher merchandise losses.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable but inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, future cash flows based on revenue growth rates and operating margins, and future economic and market conditions approximated by a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve the expected growth rates or operating margins include, but are not limited to, the general strength of the economy and other economic conditions that affect consumer preferences and spending and factors that affect the disposable income of our current and potential customers. Factors that could affect our weighted average cost of capital include changes in interest rates and changes in our effective tax rate.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the hypothetical purchase price allocation and instead using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 will be required for us on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $5.3 million, as compared to an income tax benefit of $116.9 million in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act\u201d) on our deferred tax balances in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 38.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to 106.0% in 2017. Excluding impacts from the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 41.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe tables below summarize the location activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $49.1 million, or 6.7%, to $683.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $732.5 million in 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease of $29.4 million and $19.8 million in the Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments, respectively, driven by cost savings initiatives and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base. Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 27.3% in 2017.\nOther (Gains) and Charges. Other charges decreased by $120.0 million, or 202.4%, to $(60.7) million in 2019, as compared to $59.3 million in 2018. Other gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily related to receipt of the Vintage Settlement\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 2,575 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues increased by $74.8 million, or 4.7%, to $1,653.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1,578.6 million in 2017. The increase in same store revenues was primarily attributable to an improvement in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n (2) Does not include interest payments. Our ABL Credit Agreement bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 1.50% to 2.00%. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our ABL Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019, was 3.25%. \nOverview. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $215.4 million in operating cash flow, including approximately $80 million of net pre-tax proceeds from the Vintage Settlement. We paid down debt by $303.2 million, and used cash of $28.9 million for the acquisition of businesses, and $21.2 million for capital expenditures. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of property assets of $69.7 million, ending the year with $70.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nOverview\nOperating Profit. Operating profit increased $197.8 million, or 352.2%, to $253.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $56.1 million in 2018, primarily due to an increase of $114.9 million in the Corporate segment primarily due to the other gains discussed above, and an increase of $88.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance sections below. Operating profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2.1% for 2018. Excluding other charges, profit was $193.1 million or 7.2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $115.5 million or 4.3% of revenue for the comparable period of 2018.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased in 2019 primarily due to the decreases in revenue described above, in addition to an increase in cost of merchandise sold of $9.3 million, related to our strategy to enhance our value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.7% in 2019 from 70.0% in 2018.\nPreferred Lease segment.\n (1) Does not include interest payments. Our Term Loan bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 4.50%. The Eurodollar rate on our Term Loan at December 31, 2019, was 6.25%. \nCost Savings Initiatives\nRecent Developments\nOther Charges. Other charges increased by $0.1 million, or 0.2%, to $59.3 million in 2018, as compared to $59.2 million in 2017. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to cost savings initiatives, including reductions in overhead and supply chain, incremental legal and advisory fees, Rent-A-Center Business store closures, and write-down of capitalized software assets. See Note L to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\n\nThe following table contains certain unaudited historical financial information for the quarters indicated:\nRental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable is expensed when such impairment occurs. In addition, any minor repairs made to rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair. If a customer does not return merchandise on-rent or make a payment, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on or before the 90th day following the time the account became past due in the Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, and during the month following the 150th day in the Preferred Lease segment. We maintain a reserve for these expected losses, which estimates the merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period based on a combination of historical write-offs and expected future losses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserve for merchandise losses was $55.2 million and $42.6 million, respectively.\nSegment Performance\nBased on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we do not suggest that other general risk factors, such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired locations, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe completed a qualitative assessment for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2019, concluding it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeded the reporting unit's fair value.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $53.3 million, or 7.8%, to $630.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $683.4 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $53.7 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, driven by our cost savings initiatives and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base (see Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail). Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 26.0% in 2018.\n\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit increased $119.2 million, or 189.0%, to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to operating loss of $63.1 million in 2017, primarily due to increases of $61.6 million and $45.3 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively, as discussed further in the segment performance sections below. Operating profit (loss) expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to (2.3)% for 2017. Excluding other charges, profit was $115.5 million or 4.3% of revenue or the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $(3.8) million or (0.1)% of revenue for the comparable period of 2017.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not\nContractual Cash Commitments. The table below summarizes debt, lease and other minimum cash obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2019:\nSale/Partial Leaseback of Corporate Headquarters\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $52.5 million, or 2.0%, to $2,627.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $2,680.4 million for 2017. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $75.4 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $30.3 million, or 1.8%, to $1,688.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $1,718.5 million in 2017, due primarily to a decrease of $60.4 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $23.6 million and $4.6 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Franchising segments, respectively, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 63.5% in 2018 compared to 63.6% in 2017.\n (1) Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims.  Capital Expenditures. We make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores, and investment in information technology. We spent $21.2 million, $28.0 million and $65.5 million on capital expenditures in the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQuarterly Results\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was minimally impacted by the exchange rate fluctuations as compared to 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 69.5% in 2019, compared to 69.3% in 2018.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available.\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 10.9% in 2019 from 13.5% for 2018, primarily due to the decline in gross profit described above.\n\n\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2017 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through September 26, 2017, when it was updated by the Tax Act. The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The bonus depreciation provided by the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $194 million for us in 2019. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with bonus depreciation from this act is approximately $239 million at December 31, 2019, of which approximately 78%, or $189 million, will reverse in 2020, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2021 and 2022.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\nCash used in financing activities increased by $181.3 million to $321.6 million in 2019 from $140.3 million in 2018, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $303.2 million in 2019, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $139.3 million in 2018. In addition, we increased dividend payments by $13.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $50.2 million, as compared to $5.3 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 22.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 38.6% in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $97.3 million, as compared to $101.6 million at December 31, 2018. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nOn August 13, 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp. dba Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide provider of virtual lease-to-own services, accelerating our growth in the virtual lease-to-own industry. In addition, in January 2020, we announced plans for our new integrated retail partner offering under Preferred Lease, which combines our staffed and virtual lease-to-own business models to meet the needs and expectations of both our customers and retail partners. While we believe the acquisition of the Merchants Preferred virtual business model and rollout of our Preferred Lease integrated offering positions us for significant revenue and earnings growth, we are exposed to potential operating margin degradation due to the higher cost of merchandise in our retail partner business and potential for higher merchandise losses.\nRental Merchandise. Rental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for merchandise is generally provided using the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt of rental revenue over the rental purchase agreement period. Under the income forecasting method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which is an activity-based method similar to the units of production method. We depreciate merchandise (including computers and tablets) that is held for rent for at least 180 consecutive days using the straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed 18 months. Beginning in 2016, smartphones are depreciated over an 18-month straight-line basis beginning with the earlier of on rent or 90 consecutive days on held for rent.\nWe believe cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations during the next 12 months. At February 21, 2020, we had approximately $36.2 million in cash on hand, and $168.2 million available under our ABL Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold increased by $10.1 million, or 3.3%, to $319.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $308.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to increases of $9.3 million and $1.0 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to (4.7)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from (1.5)% in 2018.\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2021. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\ndue to a decrease in gross profit, in addition to higher merchandise losses, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nVirtual Business Model\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to our strategy to enhance our value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenue decreased to 44.6% in 2019 as compared to 47.0% in 2018.\nRent-A-Center Business segment.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.7 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSeasonality. Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds.\nSenior Debt. As discussed in Notes J and K to the consolidated financial statements, in August 2019, we completed the refinancing of our prior revolving facility and effective August 5, 2019, redeemed in full our unsecured senior notes using cash on hand and proceeds from our new $300 million ABL Credit Facility and $200 million from a new term loan under our ABL Credit Agreement. We may use, subject to certain limitations and borrowing availability, $150 million under our ABL Credit Agreement for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $89 million had been so utilized as of February 21, 2020. The ABL Credit Agreement has a scheduled maturity of August 5, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nIn 2018, we initiated and executed multiple cost savings initiatives, resulting in reductions in overhead and supply chain costs. While these initiatives have led to significant decreases in operating expenses and corresponding improvement in operating profit on a year-over-year basis in our 2018 and 2019 consolidated operating results, we do not expect to continue to realize cost reduction benefits at the same annualized rate in future periods.\nMexico segment.\nGross Profit. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 26.7% in 2019 from 44.1% in 2018, primarily due to changes in revenue mix between franchise royalties and fees, and rental merchandise sales, primarily as a result of the increase in franchise locations described above.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $3.5 million, or 0.6%, to $621.9 million, as compared to $625.4 million in 2017. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a decrease of $8.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in the Preferred Lease segment. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 27.6% in 2017.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues was 13.1% for 2019 compared to 8.0% for 2018, primarily due to decreases in other store expenses of $55.1 million and store labor of $53.7 million. Declines in store labor and other store expenses were driven primarily by lower store count and cost savings initiatives. Charge-offs in our Rent-A-Center Business lease-to-own stores due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of Rent-A-Center Business lease-to-own revenues,\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses decreased by $7.7 million, or 4.5%, to $163.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $171.1 million in 2017. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 6.3% in 2017.\nWe use a two-step approach to assess goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the goodwill is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, we perform a second analysis to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities within the reporting unit, and if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As an alternative to this annual impairment testing, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment for impairment if it believes it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nNet Earnings. Net earnings were $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6.7 million in 2017. Excluding impacts from other charges and the Tax Act, net earnings were $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net loss of $28.7 million in 2017.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $39.8 million, or 6.1%, to $617.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $656.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $55.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as a result of lower Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase of $13.1 million in the Preferred Lease segment primarily related to merchandise losses. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 25.0% in 2018.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nOn December 27, 2019, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters for proceeds of $43.2 million, and entered into a lease agreement for a reduced portion, approximately 60%, of the total square footage of the building. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The lease includes an initial term of 12 years, with two five year renewal option periods at our discretion.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $44.1 million, or 2.6%, to $1,644.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1,688.2 million in 2018, due primarily to decreases of $44.7 million and $5.8 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively partially offset by increases of $3.3 million and $3.1 million in the Franchising and Mexico segments, respectively, in each case as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 61.6% in 2019 compared to 63.5% in 2018.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires immediate recognition of estimated current expected credit losses, rather than recognition when incurred. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. Adoption is required using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption. We believe application of this ASU is limited to our installment notes receivables and trade receivables with our franchisees, primarily related to merchandise sales. Based on the limited scope in which we believe this ASU applies to our business, we do not expect the impact of adoption to be material to our financial statements.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was minimally impacted by exchange rate fluctuations compared to 2018. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 9.9% in 2019, compared to 5.3% in 2018.\nor 11.7%, to $656.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $744.2 million in 2017, primarily attributable to decreases of $51.6 million and $37.5 million in the Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments, respectively, as a result of lower customer stolen merchandise losses for Preferred Lease and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 27.8% in 2017.\nAcquisitions and New Location Openings. On August 13, 2019, we completed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp d/b/a Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide virtual lease-to-own provider, for total consideration of approximately $46.3 million. In addition, during 2019, we acquired four new Rent-A-Center Business locations and customer accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.5 million in three transactions. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for information about cash used to acquire locations and accounts.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets, debt service, and dividends. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Should we require additional funding sources, we maintain a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Credit Facility\"), with commitments of $300 million, provided for under the Asset Based Loan Credit Agreement, entered into on August 5, 2019 (the \"ABLE Credit Agreement\"). We utilize our ABL Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities.\nProceeds and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by merger termination and other incremental legal and professional fees, legal settlements, state sales tax audit assessments, acquisition transaction fees, and charges related to cost savings initiatives and store closures. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses decreased by $20.8 million, or 12.7%, to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $163.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of our cost savings initiatives. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 6.1% in 2018.\nDuring the period from our 2018 goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter 2019, we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compared estimated fair value of the company, as determined based on the consolidated stock price, to its net book value. As the estimated fair value of the company was higher than its net book value during each of these periods, no additional testing was deemed necessary.\nCash provided by investing activities increased approximately $25.5 million to $20.8 million in 2019 from $(4.7) million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property assets of approximately $44.4 million, partially offset by an increase of approximately $26.9 million in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nResults of Operations\n31, 2019, in addition to the prior year receipt of our federal income tax refund in 2018 of approximately $35.2 million, partially offset by the receipt of the Vintage Settlement Proceeds in 2019.\nyet effective are either not applicable to us at this time or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements in ASC 820, to improve the effectiveness of the fair value measurement disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\n\nRevenues. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in franchise locations, as a result of refranchising previous corporate owned stores, resulting in higher merchandise sales.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, consolidated revenues decreased approximately $9.4 million, primarily driven by the sale of company owned stores to franchisees and closures of certain Rent-A-Center Business stores, partially offset by increased same store sales. Operating profit, however, increased approximately $197.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to receipt of a payment of $92.5 million in cash in May 2019 relating to the settlement on April 22, 2019 of all litigation with Vintage Rodeo Parent, LLC, Vintage Rodeo Acquisition, Inc., Vintage Capital Management, LLC and B. Riley Financial, Inc. (the \"Vintage Settlement\"); and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, reduced operating expenses related to costs savings initiatives and store closures.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and an increase in same store sales.\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $23.6 million, or 0.9%, to $2,604.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $2,627.9 million for 2018. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $55.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, partially offset by an increase of $26.7 million in the Preferred Lease segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40); Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements (CCAs) to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing agreement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion that follows.\nThe Preferred Lease segment revenues increased approximately $26.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and an increase in same store sales. Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased 2.4% primarily due to value proposition changes. Operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9% primarily\nRevenues. Revenues for 2019 were positively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $0.1 million, as compared to 2018. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased approximately $4.2 million.\nFranchising segment.", "item_7_text": "Revenues in our Rent-A-Center Business segment decreased approximately $55.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driven by the refranchising of approximately 100 locations in the past 12 months and rationalization of the Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase in same store sales. Operating profit increased $88.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in store labor and other store expenses driven by lower store count and cost savings initiatives.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit decreased by 11.6% compared to 2018, primarily due to decline in gross profit described above and higher merchandise losses. Charge-offs in our Preferred Lease locations due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 10.7% in 2019 as compared to 9.0% in 2018. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable merchandise and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Preferred Lease locations due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 0.3% and 0.6% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 2,762 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the impact of hurricanes, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues increased by $82.4 million, or 4.6%, to $1,873.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1,791.4 million in 2018. The increase in same store revenues was primarily attributable to an improvement in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $13.0 million, or 2.1%, to $634.9 million, as compared to $621.9 million in 2018. The increase in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to an increase of $31.5 million in the Preferred Lease segment as a result of higher rentals and fees revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 27.7% in 2018.\non known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.\nValuation of Goodwill. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors which could necessitate an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in our market capitalization, prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.\n\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold decreased by $13.7 million, or 4.3%, to $308.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $322.6 million in 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease of $18.8 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to (1.5)% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 2.6% in 2017.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $87.3 million,\nAt December 31, 2019, the amount of goodwill allocated to the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments was $1.5 million and $68.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 the amount of goodwill allocated to the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments was $1.5 million and $55.3 million, respectively.\n (3) As of December 31, 2019, we have recorded $24.2 million in uncertain tax positions. Because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, uncertain tax positions are not reflected in the contractual obligations table. \nwere approximately 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 3.3% in 2018. Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims. Charge-offs in our Rent-A-Center Business lease-to-own stores due to other merchandise losses, expressed as a percentage of revenues, were approximately 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 1.6% in 2018.\nThe Mexico segment revenues increased by 8.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driving an increase in operating profit of 105.6%, or $2.8 million.\nCash flow from operations was $215.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. We paid down debt by $303.2 million during the year, ending the period with $70.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nAnalysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $12.1 million to $215.4 million in 2019 from $227.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher inventory purchases during the twelve months ended December\nStore Leases. We lease space for all of our Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico stores under operating leases expiring at various times through 2026. In addition we lease space for certain support facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2032. Most of our store leases are five year leases and contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years at rental rates adjusted according to agreed-upon formulas.\nWe report financial operating performance under four operating segments. To better reflect the Company's current strategic focus, our retail partner business operations are now reported as the Preferred Lease segment (formerly Acceptance Now), which includes our virtual, staffed and hybrid business models; and our company-owned stores and e-commerce platform through rentacenter.com, are now reported as the Rent-A-Center Business segment (formerly Core U.S.). In addition, we report operating results for our Mexico and Franchising segments.\n\n\nRevenues. The decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven primarily by a decrease in rentals and fees revenue of $54.8 million, as compared to 2018. This decrease is primarily due to our refranchising efforts and the rationalization of our Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by increases in same store sales.\nMerchandise Losses. Merchandise losses consist of the following:\nOur reporting units are our reportable operating segments identified in Note S to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable but inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, future cash flows based on revenue growth rates and operating margins, and future economic and market conditions approximated by a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve the expected growth rates or operating margins include, but are not limited to, the general strength of the economy and other economic conditions that affect consumer preferences and spending and factors that affect the disposable income of our current and potential customers. Factors that could affect our weighted average cost of capital include changes in interest rates and changes in our effective tax rate.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the hypothetical purchase price allocation and instead using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 will be required for us on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $5.3 million, as compared to an income tax benefit of $116.9 million in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act\u201d) on our deferred tax balances in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 38.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to 106.0% in 2017. Excluding impacts from the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 41.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe tables below summarize the location activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $49.1 million, or 6.7%, to $683.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $732.5 million in 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease of $29.4 million and $19.8 million in the Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments, respectively, driven by cost savings initiatives and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base. Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 27.3% in 2017.\nOther (Gains) and Charges. Other charges decreased by $120.0 million, or 202.4%, to $(60.7) million in 2019, as compared to $59.3 million in 2018. Other gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily related to receipt of the Vintage Settlement\nSame store revenue is reported on a constant currency basis and generally represents revenue earned in 2,575 locations that were operated by us for 13 months or more, excluding any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from another store (acquisition or merger). Receiving stores will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. In addition, due to the severity of the hurricane impacts, we instituted a change to the same store sales store selection criteria to exclude stores in geographically impacted regions for 18 months. Same store revenues increased by $74.8 million, or 4.7%, to $1,653.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1,578.6 million in 2017. The increase in same store revenues was primarily attributable to an improvement in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n (2) Does not include interest payments. Our ABL Credit Agreement bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 1.50% to 2.00%. The weighted average Eurodollar rate on our ABL Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019, was 3.25%. \nOverview. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $215.4 million in operating cash flow, including approximately $80 million of net pre-tax proceeds from the Vintage Settlement. We paid down debt by $303.2 million, and used cash of $28.9 million for the acquisition of businesses, and $21.2 million for capital expenditures. In addition, we received proceeds from the sale of property assets of $69.7 million, ending the year with $70.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nOverview\nOperating Profit. Operating profit increased $197.8 million, or 352.2%, to $253.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $56.1 million in 2018, primarily due to an increase of $114.9 million in the Corporate segment primarily due to the other gains discussed above, and an increase of $88.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance sections below. Operating profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2.1% for 2018. Excluding other charges, profit was $193.1 million or 7.2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $115.5 million or 4.3% of revenue for the comparable period of 2018.\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased in 2019 primarily due to the decreases in revenue described above, in addition to an increase in cost of merchandise sold of $9.3 million, related to our strategy to enhance our value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 69.7% in 2019 from 70.0% in 2018.\nPreferred Lease segment.\n (1) Does not include interest payments. Our Term Loan bears interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus 4.50%. The Eurodollar rate on our Term Loan at December 31, 2019, was 6.25%. \nCost Savings Initiatives\nRecent Developments\nOther Charges. Other charges increased by $0.1 million, or 0.2%, to $59.3 million in 2018, as compared to $59.2 million in 2017. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to cost savings initiatives, including reductions in overhead and supply chain, incremental legal and advisory fees, Rent-A-Center Business store closures, and write-down of capitalized software assets. See Note L to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\n\nThe following table contains certain unaudited historical financial information for the quarters indicated:\nRental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable is expensed when such impairment occurs. In addition, any minor repairs made to rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair. If a customer does not return merchandise on-rent or make a payment, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on or before the 90th day following the time the account became past due in the Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, and during the month following the 150th day in the Preferred Lease segment. We maintain a reserve for these expected losses, which estimates the merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period based on a combination of historical write-offs and expected future losses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserve for merchandise losses was $55.2 million and $42.6 million, respectively.\nSegment Performance\nBased on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we do not suggest that other general risk factors, such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired locations, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe completed a qualitative assessment for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2019, concluding it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeded the reporting unit's fair value.\nStore Labor. Store labor includes all salaries and wages paid to store-level employees and district managers' salaries, together with payroll taxes and benefits. Store labor decreased by $53.3 million, or 7.8%, to $630.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $683.4 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $53.7 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, driven by our cost savings initiatives and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base (see Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail). Store labor expressed as a percentage of total store revenue was 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 26.0% in 2018.\n\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit increased $119.2 million, or 189.0%, to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to operating loss of $63.1 million in 2017, primarily due to increases of $61.6 million and $45.3 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively, as discussed further in the segment performance sections below. Operating profit (loss) expressed as a percentage of total revenue was 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to (2.3)% for 2017. Excluding other charges, profit was $115.5 million or 4.3% of revenue or the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $(3.8) million or (0.1)% of revenue for the comparable period of 2017.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not\nContractual Cash Commitments. The table below summarizes debt, lease and other minimum cash obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2019:\nSale/Partial Leaseback of Corporate Headquarters\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $52.5 million, or 2.0%, to $2,627.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $2,680.4 million for 2017. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $75.4 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $20.3 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $30.3 million, or 1.8%, to $1,688.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $1,718.5 million in 2017, due primarily to a decrease of $60.4 million in the Preferred Lease segment, partially offset by an increase of $23.6 million and $4.6 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Franchising segments, respectively, as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 63.5% in 2018 compared to 63.6% in 2017.\n (1) Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims.  Capital Expenditures. We make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores, and investment in information technology. We spent $21.2 million, $28.0 million and $65.5 million on capital expenditures in the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nQuarterly Results\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was minimally impacted by the exchange rate fluctuations as compared to 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 69.5% in 2019, compared to 69.3% in 2018.\nIncome Taxes. Our annual tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of our earnings, legislation and acquisitions, and is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to differing interpretations between the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense, evaluating our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available.\nThe following discussion focuses on our results of operations and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 10.9% in 2019 from 13.5% for 2018, primarily due to the decline in gross profit described above.\n\n\nDeferred Taxes. Certain federal tax legislation enacted during the period 2009 to 2017 permitted bonus first-year depreciation deductions ranging from 50% to 100% of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during such years. The depreciation benefits associated with these tax acts are now reversing. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (\"PATH\") extended the 50% bonus depreciation to 2015 and through September 26, 2017, when it was updated by the Tax Act. The Tax Act allows 100% bonus depreciation for certain property placed in service between September 27, 2017 and December 31, 2022, at which point it will begin to phase out. The bonus depreciation provided by the Tax Act resulted in an estimated benefit of $194 million for us in 2019. We estimate the remaining tax deferral associated with bonus depreciation from this act is approximately $239 million at December 31, 2019, of which approximately 78%, or $189 million, will reverse in 2020, and the majority of the remainder will reverse between 2021 and 2022.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\nCash used in financing activities increased by $181.3 million to $321.6 million in 2019 from $140.3 million in 2018, primarily driven by our net reduction in debt of $303.2 million in 2019, as compared to a net decrease in debt of $139.3 million in 2018. In addition, we increased dividend payments by $13.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $50.2 million, as compared to $5.3 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 22.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 38.6% in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the amount reserved for losses within our self-insured retentions with respect to workers' compensation, general liability and vehicle liability insurance was $97.3 million, as compared to $101.6 million at December 31, 2018. However, if any of the factors that contribute to the overall cost of insurance claims were to change, the actual amount incurred for our self-insurance liabilities could be more or less than the amounts currently reserved.\nOn August 13, 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp. dba Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide provider of virtual lease-to-own services, accelerating our growth in the virtual lease-to-own industry. In addition, in January 2020, we announced plans for our new integrated retail partner offering under Preferred Lease, which combines our staffed and virtual lease-to-own business models to meet the needs and expectations of both our customers and retail partners. While we believe the acquisition of the Merchants Preferred virtual business model and rollout of our Preferred Lease integrated offering positions us for significant revenue and earnings growth, we are exposed to potential operating margin degradation due to the higher cost of merchandise in our retail partner business and potential for higher merchandise losses.\nRental Merchandise. Rental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for merchandise is generally provided using the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt of rental revenue over the rental purchase agreement period. Under the income forecasting method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which is an activity-based method similar to the units of production method. We depreciate merchandise (including computers and tablets) that is held for rent for at least 180 consecutive days using the straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed 18 months. Beginning in 2016, smartphones are depreciated over an 18-month straight-line basis beginning with the earlier of on rent or 90 consecutive days on held for rent.\nWe believe cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations during the next 12 months. At February 21, 2020, we had approximately $36.2 million in cash on hand, and $168.2 million available under our ABL Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019.\nCost of Merchandise Sold. Cost of merchandise sold represents the net book value of rental merchandise at time of sale. Cost of merchandise sold increased by $10.1 million, or 3.3%, to $319.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $308.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to increases of $9.3 million and $1.0 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively. The gross margin percent of merchandise sales decreased to (4.7)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from (1.5)% in 2018.\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2021. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\ndue to a decrease in gross profit, in addition to higher merchandise losses, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions.\nVirtual Business Model\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to our strategy to enhance our value proposition. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenue decreased to 44.6% in 2019 as compared to 47.0% in 2018.\nRent-A-Center Business segment.\nIf we make changes to our reserves in accordance with the policies described below, our earnings would be impacted. Increases to our reserves would reduce earnings and, similarly, reductions to our reserves would increase our earnings. A pre-tax change of approximately $0.7 million in our estimates would result in a corresponding $0.01 change in our diluted earnings per common share.\nSeasonality. Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds.\nSenior Debt. As discussed in Notes J and K to the consolidated financial statements, in August 2019, we completed the refinancing of our prior revolving facility and effective August 5, 2019, redeemed in full our unsecured senior notes using cash on hand and proceeds from our new $300 million ABL Credit Facility and $200 million from a new term loan under our ABL Credit Agreement. We may use, subject to certain limitations and borrowing availability, $150 million under our ABL Credit Agreement for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $89 million had been so utilized as of February 21, 2020. The ABL Credit Agreement has a scheduled maturity of August 5, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessments in Our Financial Statements\nIn 2018, we initiated and executed multiple cost savings initiatives, resulting in reductions in overhead and supply chain costs. While these initiatives have led to significant decreases in operating expenses and corresponding improvement in operating profit on a year-over-year basis in our 2018 and 2019 consolidated operating results, we do not expect to continue to realize cost reduction benefits at the same annualized rate in future periods.\nMexico segment.\nGross Profit. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to 26.7% in 2019 from 44.1% in 2018, primarily due to changes in revenue mix between franchise royalties and fees, and rental merchandise sales, primarily as a result of the increase in franchise locations described above.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\nCost of Rentals and Fees. Cost of rentals and fees consists primarily of depreciation of rental merchandise. Cost of rentals and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $3.5 million, or 0.6%, to $621.9 million, as compared to $625.4 million in 2017. This decrease in cost of rentals and fees was primarily attributable to a decrease of $8.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment as a result of lower rentals and fees revenue, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in the Preferred Lease segment. Cost of rentals and fees expressed as a percentage of rentals and fees revenue increased to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 27.6% in 2017.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues was 13.1% for 2019 compared to 8.0% for 2018, primarily due to decreases in other store expenses of $55.1 million and store labor of $53.7 million. Declines in store labor and other store expenses were driven primarily by lower store count and cost savings initiatives. Charge-offs in our Rent-A-Center Business lease-to-own stores due to customer stolen merchandise, expressed as a percentage of Rent-A-Center Business lease-to-own revenues,\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses decreased by $7.7 million, or 4.5%, to $163.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $171.1 million in 2017. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 6.3% in 2017.\nWe use a two-step approach to assess goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the goodwill is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, we perform a second analysis to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities within the reporting unit, and if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As an alternative to this annual impairment testing, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment for impairment if it believes it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nNet Earnings. Net earnings were $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6.7 million in 2017. Excluding impacts from other charges and the Tax Act, net earnings were $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net loss of $28.7 million in 2017.\nOther Store Expenses. Other store expenses include occupancy, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, delivery, advertising, selling, insurance, travel and other store-level operating expenses. Other store expenses decreased by $39.8 million, or 6.1%, to $617.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $656.9 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease of $55.1 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, as a result of lower Rent-A-Center Business store base, partially offset by an increase of $13.1 million in the Preferred Lease segment primarily related to merchandise losses. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 25.0% in 2018.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical.\nOn December 27, 2019, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters for proceeds of $43.2 million, and entered into a lease agreement for a reduced portion, approximately 60%, of the total square footage of the building. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The lease includes an initial term of 12 years, with two five year renewal option periods at our discretion.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $44.1 million, or 2.6%, to $1,644.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1,688.2 million in 2018, due primarily to decreases of $44.7 million and $5.8 million in the Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, respectively partially offset by increases of $3.3 million and $3.1 million in the Franchising and Mexico segments, respectively, in each case as discussed further in the segment performance section below. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 61.6% in 2019 compared to 63.5% in 2018.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires immediate recognition of estimated current expected credit losses, rather than recognition when incurred. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. Adoption is required using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption. We believe application of this ASU is limited to our installment notes receivables and trade receivables with our franchisees, primarily related to merchandise sales. Based on the limited scope in which we believe this ASU applies to our business, we do not expect the impact of adoption to be material to our financial statements.\n(1) Does not include virtual locations.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOperating Profit. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was minimally impacted by exchange rate fluctuations compared to 2018. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 9.9% in 2019, compared to 5.3% in 2018.\nor 11.7%, to $656.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $744.2 million in 2017, primarily attributable to decreases of $51.6 million and $37.5 million in the Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments, respectively, as a result of lower customer stolen merchandise losses for Preferred Lease and lower Rent-A-Center Business store base. Other store expenses expressed as a percentage of total store revenue decreased to 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 27.8% in 2017.\nAcquisitions and New Location Openings. On August 13, 2019, we completed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all of the assets of C/C Financial Corp d/b/a Merchants Preferred (\"Merchants Preferred\"), a nationwide virtual lease-to-own provider, for total consideration of approximately $46.3 million. In addition, during 2019, we acquired four new Rent-A-Center Business locations and customer accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.5 million in three transactions. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for information about cash used to acquire locations and accounts.\nLiquidity Requirements. Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases. Other capital requirements include expenditures for property assets, debt service, and dividends. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations. Should we require additional funding sources, we maintain a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Credit Facility\"), with commitments of $300 million, provided for under the Asset Based Loan Credit Agreement, entered into on August 5, 2019 (the \"ABLE Credit Agreement\"). We utilize our ABL Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities.\nProceeds and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by merger termination and other incremental legal and professional fees, legal settlements, state sales tax audit assessments, acquisition transaction fees, and charges related to cost savings initiatives and store closures. See Note M to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these other charges.\nWe continually institute procedures to manage our loss exposure and increases in health care costs associated with our insurance claims through our risk management function, including a transitional duty program for injured workers, ongoing safety and accident prevention training, and various other programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries, payroll taxes and benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, administrative and other operating expenses, as well as salaries and labor costs for our regional directors, divisional vice presidents and executive vice presidents. General and administrative expenses decreased by $20.8 million, or 12.7%, to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $163.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of our cost savings initiatives. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 6.1% in 2018.\nDuring the period from our 2018 goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter 2019, we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compared estimated fair value of the company, as determined based on the consolidated stock price, to its net book value. As the estimated fair value of the company was higher than its net book value during each of these periods, no additional testing was deemed necessary.\nCash provided by investing activities increased approximately $25.5 million to $20.8 million in 2019 from $(4.7) million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property assets of approximately $44.4 million, partially offset by an increase of approximately $26.9 million in cash used for the acquisition of businesses.\nResults of Operations\n31, 2019, in addition to the prior year receipt of our federal income tax refund in 2018 of approximately $35.2 million, partially offset by the receipt of the Vintage Settlement Proceeds in 2019.\nyet effective are either not applicable to us at this time or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements in ASC 820, to improve the effectiveness of the fair value measurement disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\n\nRevenues. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in franchise locations, as a result of refranchising previous corporate owned stores, resulting in higher merchandise sales.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, consolidated revenues decreased approximately $9.4 million, primarily driven by the sale of company owned stores to franchisees and closures of certain Rent-A-Center Business stores, partially offset by increased same store sales. Operating profit, however, increased approximately $197.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to receipt of a payment of $92.5 million in cash in May 2019 relating to the settlement on April 22, 2019 of all litigation with Vintage Rodeo Parent, LLC, Vintage Rodeo Acquisition, Inc., Vintage Capital Management, LLC and B. Riley Financial, Inc. (the \"Vintage Settlement\"); and gain recorded on the sale of our corporate headquarters, reduced operating expenses related to costs savings initiatives and store closures.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and an increase in same store sales.\nStore Revenue. Total store revenue decreased by $23.6 million, or 0.9%, to $2,604.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $2,627.9 million for 2018. This was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $55.2 million in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, partially offset by an increase of $26.7 million in the Preferred Lease segment, as discussed further in the segment performance section below.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40); Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements (CCAs) to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing agreement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 will be required for us beginning January 1, 2020. We do not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nThe following table is a reference for the discussion that follows.\nThe Preferred Lease segment revenues increased approximately $26.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and an increase in same store sales. Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased 2.4% primarily due to value proposition changes. Operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9% primarily\nRevenues. Revenues for 2019 were positively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $0.1 million, as compared to 2018. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased approximately $4.2 million.\nFranchising segment.", "item_7_tables": "Table 104: <table><tr><td> </td>
